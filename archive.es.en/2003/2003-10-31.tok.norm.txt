fischer , speaking at a press conference in the south african city of pretoria on the latest leg on his tour of african nations , told the assembled media that it was in the interests of zimbabweans and the whole of the african continent to work together to resolve the crisis under robert mugabe ’ s dictatorship .
" what we try to do is to encourage all our friends in africa to solve this problem , this crisis , based on common values and in the interests of the zimbabwean people , " he told reporters .
he added that it was important for discussions to continue on how to revive the democratic development of zimbabwe , not just for that country , but for the whole of africa .
fischer was speaking after co-chairing the fourth session of the south african-german bi-national commission with deputy president jacob zuma .
cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .

returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .
fischer arrived in south africa on thursday after visiting namibia early on wednesday and then traveling to the west to spend the day in mali .
praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero landowner in the times of german colonial rule .
many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .
tens of thousands of the native herero tribe lost their lives during a 1904-07 uprising against the german occupation .
members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .
fischer added that germany stood by its past .
fischer flies on to cape town on friday to participate in a discussion at the university of cape town titled : can the un meet the challenges of the 21st century ? - the need for german-south african co-operation .

fischer , speaking at a press conference in the south african city of pretoria on the latest leg on his tour of african nations , told the assembled media that it was in the interests of zimbabweans and the whole of the african continent to work together to resolve the crisis under robert mugabe ’ s dictatorship .
" what we try to do is to encourage all our friends in africa to solve this problem , this crisis , based on common values and in the interests of the zimbabwean people , " he told reporters .
he added that it was important for discussions to continue on how to revive the democratic development of zimbabwe , not just for that country , but for the whole of africa .
fischer was speaking after co-chairing the fourth session of the south african-german bi-national commission with deputy president jacob zuma .
cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe .
returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .
fischer arrived in south africa on thursday after visiting namibia early on wednesday and then traveling to the west to spend the day in mali .
praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero landowner in the times of german colonial rule .
many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .
tens of thousands of the native herero tribe lost their lives during a 1904-07 uprising against the german occupation .
members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .

emergency services , who found the bodies of the two men , aged 48 and 44 still strapped to their seats had been struggling to reach the aircraft , which crashed into a boggy field near the german town of brannenburg .
police sources said the plane , a former military aircraft which had been converted for civilian purposes , was not equipped with ejector seats .
the cause of the crash is not yet clear , and a police spokesman in the region said it would likely take the german aviation authorities several weeks if not months to establish exactly what had happened , not least because the aircraft was n't equipped with either a black box or a flight recorder . more briefs 31.10.2003 -pipe- no plans to change german stem cell rules 30.10.2003 -pipe- judge refuses to free alleged 9/11 accomplice 30.10.2003 -pipe- opposition leader promotes own tax reforms 30.10.2003 -pipe- olympic bid racked by further sacking 30.10.2003 -pipe- germany and poland call for european dialogue on expulsions center 29.10.2003 -pipe- report : german tour buses need safety improvements 29.10.2003 -pipe- schröder mulling summit for leipzig olympic bid 29.10.2003 -pipe- protestors take tower at nuclear waste depot radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on the basis of an inquiry published by the statistics office , the flood waters carried some 4,800 cubic meters of fuel oil and other dangerous substances into the environment .
in most instances , the pollutants were washed out of private fuel oil tanks in the affected areas .
over the past few years an average of 6,400 cubic metres of pollutants have made it into german waters .

the halloween industry is booming . halloween , the festival of ghosts , is an old tradition in the united states .
october 31st , all hallows eve , is the night witches and wizards come out to play .
legend has it that on this evening , celtic priests walked from house to house demanding human sacrifices .
they left behind what 's nowadays called a " jack o ' lantern , " a hollowed-out pumpkin with a wickedly scary face . in recent years , the heathen custom of halloween has become increasingly popular in germany .
it 's approached in much the same way as carnival , another popular celebration of pre-christian myths , when the demons of winter are driven away and the longer days of spring ushered in . big business these days , oct .
31 spells big business .
once considered a strange overseas tradition , halloween has fast become a new party trend .
bernd schneider manages germany ’ s biggest store for costumes in cologne .
his explanation for why more and more germans like giving each other the creeps is that " in germany , halloween became popular with movies like halloween or nightmare on elmstreet .
they mainly shaped the way germans celebrate this evening .
the more shocking , the more scary , the more they like it . "
according to schneider , favorite outfits include " the mask from the scream movie , first of all .

all this is very hip . " once dressed up , the scary crowd goes " trick-or-treating " from door to door - begging for candies or threatening their neighbours with little tricks .
that 's why the candy industry also profits from the new german halloween boom .
last year , candy industry sales increased to over € 7 million , twice as much as in 2001 .
all in all , in 2002 retailers and supermarkets earned around € 180 million from halloween sales .
this year , they are expecting sales of more than € 200 million .
toy manufacturers also expect an increase in sales of up to 40 percent .
for bernd schneider ’ s store , halloween is a fixed business date .
" one third of our sales volume is due to halloween " , he says , " and it becomes more every year . " an ungodly import but not everyone is as thrilled with the trend as the retailers .
speaking on inforadio berlin-brandenburg , bishop wolfgang huber expressed concern that " halloween has become a day celebrated by satanists . "
his views are echoed by moscow 's orthodox church , whose calls for a halloween ban in schools were heeded by the moscow education department . meanwhile , in france , catholics are organizing a series of events celebrating all saints day on saturday and the festival of the dead on sunday , which they hope will draw attention away from what they see as an ungodly u.s. import . in an interview with reuters news agency , ines azais from the french catholic church lamented the fact that " halloween has put christian holidays in the shade .

fischer , speaking at a press conference in the south african city of pretoria on the latest leg on his tour of african nations , told the assembled media that it was in the interests of zimbabweans and the whole of the african continent to work together to resolve the crisis under robert mugabe ’ s dictatorship .
" what we try to do is to encourage all our friends in africa to solve this problem , this crisis , based on common values and in the interests of the zimbabwean people , " he told reporters .
he added that it was important for discussions to continue on how to revive the democratic development of zimbabwe , not just for that country , but for the whole of africa .
fischer was speaking after co-chairing the fourth session of the south african-german bi-national commission with deputy president jacob zuma .
cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe .
returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .
fischer arrived in south africa on thursday after visiting namibia early on wednesday and then traveling to the west to spend the day in mali .
praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .

many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .
tens of thousands of the native herero tribe lost their lives during a 1904-07 uprising against the german occupation .
members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .
fischer added that germany stood by its past .
fischer flies on to cape town on friday to participate in a discussion at the university of cape town titled : can the un meet the challenges of the 21st century ? - the need for german-south african co-operation .

" what we try to do is to encourage all our friends in africa to solve this problem , this crisis , based on common values and in the interests of the zimbabwean people , " he told reporters .
he added that it was important for discussions to continue on how to revive the democratic development of zimbabwe , not just for that country , but for the whole of africa .
fischer was speaking after co-chairing the fourth session of the south african-german bi-national commission with deputy president jacob zuma .
cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .

returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .

praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .

a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .

“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero landowner in the times of german colonial rule .
many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .

members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .
fischer added that germany stood by its past .

fischer , speaking at a press conference in the south african city of pretoria on the latest leg on his tour of african nations , told the assembled media that it was in the interests of zimbabweans and the whole of the african continent to work together to resolve the crisis under robert mugabe ’ s dictatorship .
" what we try to do is to encourage all our friends in africa to solve this problem , this crisis , based on common values and in the interests of the zimbabwean people , " he told reporters .
he added that it was important for discussions to continue on how to revive the democratic development of zimbabwe , not just for that country , but for the whole of africa .
fischer was speaking after co-chairing the fourth session of the south african-german bi-national commission with deputy president jacob zuma .
cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe .
returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .
fischer arrived in south africa on thursday after visiting namibia early on wednesday and then traveling to the west to spend the day in mali .
praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .

fischer , speaking at a press conference in the south african city of pretoria on the latest leg on his tour of african nations , told the assembled media that it was in the interests of zimbabweans and the whole of the african continent to work together to resolve the crisis under robert mugabe ’ s dictatorship .
" what we try to do is to encourage all our friends in africa to solve this problem , this crisis , based on common values and in the interests of the zimbabwean people , " he told reporters .
he added that it was important for discussions to continue on how to revive the democratic development of zimbabwe , not just for that country , but for the whole of africa .
fischer was speaking after co-chairing the fourth session of the south african-german bi-national commission with deputy president jacob zuma .
cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe .
returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .
fischer arrived in south africa on thursday after visiting namibia early on wednesday and then traveling to the west to spend the day in mali .
praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero landowner in the times of german colonial rule .
many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .
tens of thousands of the native herero tribe lost their lives during a 1904-07 uprising against the german occupation .
members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .
fischer added that germany stood by its past .
fischer flies on to cape town on friday to participate in a discussion at the university of cape town titled : can the un meet the challenges of the 21st century ? - the need for german-south african co-operation .

fischer , speaking at a press conference in the south african city of pretoria on the latest leg on his tour of african nations , told the assembled media that it was in the interests of zimbabweans and the whole of the african continent to work together to resolve the crisis under robert mugabe ’ s dictatorship .
" what we try to do is to encourage all our friends in africa to solve this problem , this crisis , based on common values and in the interests of the zimbabwean people , " he told reporters .
he added that it was important for discussions to continue on how to revive the democratic development of zimbabwe , not just for that country , but for the whole of africa .
fischer was speaking after co-chairing the fourth session of the south african-german bi-national commission with deputy president jacob zuma .
cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe .
returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .
fischer arrived in south africa on thursday after visiting namibia early on wednesday and then traveling to the west to spend the day in mali .
praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero landowner in the times of german colonial rule .
many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .
tens of thousands of the native herero tribe lost their lives during a 1904-07 uprising against the german occupation .
members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .
fischer added that germany stood by its past .
fischer flies on to cape town on friday to participate in a discussion at the university of cape town titled : can the un meet the challenges of the 21st century ? - the need for german-south african co-operation .

fischer , speaking at a press conference in the south african city of pretoria on the latest leg on his tour of african nations , told the assembled media that it was in the interests of zimbabweans and the whole of the african continent to work together to resolve the crisis under robert mugabe ’ s dictatorship .
" what we try to do is to encourage all our friends in africa to solve this problem , this crisis , based on common values and in the interests of the zimbabwean people , " he told reporters .
he added that it was important for discussions to continue on how to revive the democratic development of zimbabwe , not just for that country , but for the whole of africa .
fischer was speaking after co-chairing the fourth session of the south african-german bi-national commission with deputy president jacob zuma .
cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe .
returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .
fischer arrived in south africa on thursday after visiting namibia early on wednesday and then traveling to the west to spend the day in mali .
praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero landowner in the times of german colonial rule .
many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .
tens of thousands of the native herero tribe lost their lives during a 1904-07 uprising against the german occupation .
members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .
fischer added that germany stood by its past .
fischer flies on to cape town on friday to participate in a discussion at the university of cape town titled : can the un meet the challenges of the 21st century ? - the need for german-south african co-operation .
he will also hold talks with south africa 's speaker of parliament frene ginwala and visit german development initiatives in the city on saturday before concluding his three-nation africa trip . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a marshall plan for africa - sort of the g8 leaders gathering in canada this week want to unveil a new action plan to reduce poverty , corruption , stop the spread of aids in africa .

once considered a strange overseas tradition , halloween has fast become a new party trend .
bernd schneider manages germany ’ s biggest store for costumes in cologne .
his explanation for why more and more germans like giving each other the creeps is that " in germany , halloween became popular with movies like halloween or nightmare on elmstreet .
they mainly shaped the way germans celebrate this evening .

fischer , speaking at a press conference in the south african city of pretoria on the latest leg on his tour of african nations , told the assembled media that it was in the interests of zimbabweans and the whole of the african continent to work together to resolve the crisis under robert mugabe ’ s dictatorship .
" what we try to do is to encourage all our friends in africa to solve this problem , this crisis , based on common values and in the interests of the zimbabwean people , " he told reporters .
he added that it was important for discussions to continue on how to revive the democratic development of zimbabwe , not just for that country , but for the whole of africa .
fischer was speaking after co-chairing the fourth session of the south african-german bi-national commission with deputy president jacob zuma .
cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe .
returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .
fischer arrived in south africa on thursday after visiting namibia early on wednesday and then traveling to the west to spend the day in mali .
praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero landowner in the times of german colonial rule .
many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .
tens of thousands of the native herero tribe lost their lives during a 1904-07 uprising against the german occupation .
members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .
fischer added that germany stood by its past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.10.2003 germany gripped by halloween fever großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in recent years , halloween parties have become increasingly popular in germany .
across the country , germans are dusting down their pointy hats and flying broomsticks .
the halloween industry is booming . halloween , the festival of ghosts , is an old tradition in the united states .
october 31st , all hallows eve , is the night witches and wizards come out to play .
legend has it that on this evening , celtic priests walked from house to house demanding human sacrifices .
they left behind what 's nowadays called a " jack o ' lantern , " a hollowed-out pumpkin with a wickedly scary face . in recent years , the heathen custom of halloween has become increasingly popular in germany .
it 's approached in much the same way as carnival , another popular celebration of pre-christian myths , when the demons of winter are driven away and the longer days of spring ushered in . big business these days , oct .
31 spells big business .
once considered a strange overseas tradition , halloween has fast become a new party trend .
bernd schneider manages germany ’ s biggest store for costumes in cologne .
his explanation for why more and more germans like giving each other the creeps is that " in germany , halloween became popular with movies like halloween or nightmare on elmstreet .
they mainly shaped the way germans celebrate this evening .
the more shocking , the more scary , the more they like it . "
according to schneider , favorite outfits include " the mask from the scream movie , first of all .
and classical masks like devils , witches , dracula , the grim reaper , gravediggers , skulls .
all this is very hip . " once dressed up , the scary crowd goes " trick-or-treating " from door to door - begging for candies or threatening their neighbours with little tricks .
that 's why the candy industry also profits from the new german halloween boom .
last year , candy industry sales increased to over € 7 million , twice as much as in 2001 .
all in all , in 2002 retailers and supermarkets earned around € 180 million from halloween sales .
this year , they are expecting sales of more than € 200 million .
toy manufacturers also expect an increase in sales of up to 40 percent .
for bernd schneider ’ s store , halloween is a fixed business date .
" one third of our sales volume is due to halloween " , he says , " and it becomes more every year . " an ungodly import but not everyone is as thrilled with the trend as the retailers .
speaking on inforadio berlin-brandenburg , bishop wolfgang huber expressed concern that " halloween has become a day celebrated by satanists . "
his views are echoed by moscow 's orthodox church , whose calls for a halloween ban in schools were heeded by the moscow education department . meanwhile , in france , catholics are organizing a series of events celebrating all saints day on saturday and the festival of the dead on sunday , which they hope will draw attention away from what they see as an ungodly u.s. import . in an interview with reuters news agency , ines azais from the french catholic church lamented the fact that " halloween has put christian holidays in the shade .
lots of young people do n't know them anymore . " but to others , the pagan aspect of the festivities is the whole point . bernd schneider points out that " for everyone it ’ s fun to imagine what could be one ’ s dark side .
you can be the grim reaper , or a vampire , a witch or a devil maybe – someone really brutal .
but first of all , it ’ s fun to dress up - and to have a good time together with friends . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

across the country , germans are dusting down their pointy hats and flying broomsticks .
the halloween industry is booming . halloween , the festival of ghosts , is an old tradition in the united states .
october 31st , all hallows eve , is the night witches and wizards come out to play .
legend has it that on this evening , celtic priests walked from house to house demanding human sacrifices .
they left behind what 's nowadays called a " jack o ' lantern , " a hollowed-out pumpkin with a wickedly scary face . in recent years , the heathen custom of halloween has become increasingly popular in germany .
it 's approached in much the same way as carnival , another popular celebration of pre-christian myths , when the demons of winter are driven away and the longer days of spring ushered in . big business these days , oct .
31 spells big business .
once considered a strange overseas tradition , halloween has fast become a new party trend .
bernd schneider manages germany ’ s biggest store for costumes in cologne .
his explanation for why more and more germans like giving each other the creeps is that " in germany , halloween became popular with movies like halloween or nightmare on elmstreet .
they mainly shaped the way germans celebrate this evening .
the more shocking , the more scary , the more they like it . "
according to schneider , favorite outfits include " the mask from the scream movie , first of all .
and classical masks like devils , witches , dracula , the grim reaper , gravediggers , skulls .
all this is very hip . " once dressed up , the scary crowd goes " trick-or-treating " from door to door - begging for candies or threatening their neighbours with little tricks .
that 's why the candy industry also profits from the new german halloween boom .
last year , candy industry sales increased to over € 7 million , twice as much as in 2001 .
all in all , in 2002 retailers and supermarkets earned around € 180 million from halloween sales .
this year , they are expecting sales of more than € 200 million .
toy manufacturers also expect an increase in sales of up to 40 percent .
for bernd schneider ’ s store , halloween is a fixed business date .
" one third of our sales volume is due to halloween " , he says , " and it becomes more every year . " an ungodly import but not everyone is as thrilled with the trend as the retailers .
speaking on inforadio berlin-brandenburg , bishop wolfgang huber expressed concern that " halloween has become a day celebrated by satanists . "
his views are echoed by moscow 's orthodox church , whose calls for a halloween ban in schools were heeded by the moscow education department . meanwhile , in france , catholics are organizing a series of events celebrating all saints day on saturday and the festival of the dead on sunday , which they hope will draw attention away from what they see as an ungodly u.s. import . in an interview with reuters news agency , ines azais from the french catholic church lamented the fact that " halloween has put christian holidays in the shade .
lots of young people do n't know them anymore . " but to others , the pagan aspect of the festivities is the whole point . bernd schneider points out that " for everyone it ’ s fun to imagine what could be one ’ s dark side .
you can be the grim reaper , or a vampire , a witch or a devil maybe – someone really brutal .
but first of all , it ’ s fun to dress up - and to have a good time together with friends . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

fischer , speaking at a press conference in the south african city of pretoria on the latest leg on his tour of african nations , told the assembled media that it was in the interests of zimbabweans and the whole of the african continent to work together to resolve the crisis under robert mugabe ’ s dictatorship .
" what we try to do is to encourage all our friends in africa to solve this problem , this crisis , based on common values and in the interests of the zimbabwean people , " he told reporters .
he added that it was important for discussions to continue on how to revive the democratic development of zimbabwe , not just for that country , but for the whole of africa .
fischer was speaking after co-chairing the fourth session of the south african-german bi-national commission with deputy president jacob zuma .
cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe .
returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .
fischer arrived in south africa on thursday after visiting namibia early on wednesday and then traveling to the west to spend the day in mali .
praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero landowner in the times of german colonial rule .
many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .
tens of thousands of the native herero tribe lost their lives during a 1904-07 uprising against the german occupation .
members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .
fischer added that germany stood by its past .
fischer flies on to cape town on friday to participate in a discussion at the university of cape town titled : can the un meet the challenges of the 21st century ? - the need for german-south african co-operation .

fischer , speaking at a press conference in the south african city of pretoria on the latest leg on his tour of african nations , told the assembled media that it was in the interests of zimbabweans and the whole of the african continent to work together to resolve the crisis under robert mugabe ’ s dictatorship .
" what we try to do is to encourage all our friends in africa to solve this problem , this crisis , based on common values and in the interests of the zimbabwean people , " he told reporters .
he added that it was important for discussions to continue on how to revive the democratic development of zimbabwe , not just for that country , but for the whole of africa .
fischer was speaking after co-chairing the fourth session of the south african-german bi-national commission with deputy president jacob zuma .
cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe .
returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .
fischer arrived in south africa on thursday after visiting namibia early on wednesday and then traveling to the west to spend the day in mali .
praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero landowner in the times of german colonial rule .
many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .
tens of thousands of the native herero tribe lost their lives during a 1904-07 uprising against the german occupation .
members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .
fischer added that germany stood by its past .
fischer flies on to cape town on friday to participate in a discussion at the university of cape town titled : can the un meet the challenges of the 21st century ? - the need for german-south african co-operation .

fischer , speaking at a press conference in the south african city of pretoria on the latest leg on his tour of african nations , told the assembled media that it was in the interests of zimbabweans and the whole of the african continent to work together to resolve the crisis under robert mugabe ’ s dictatorship .
" what we try to do is to encourage all our friends in africa to solve this problem , this crisis , based on common values and in the interests of the zimbabwean people , " he told reporters .
he added that it was important for discussions to continue on how to revive the democratic development of zimbabwe , not just for that country , but for the whole of africa .
fischer was speaking after co-chairing the fourth session of the south african-german bi-national commission with deputy president jacob zuma .
cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean president robert mugabe .
returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .
fischer arrived in south africa on thursday after visiting namibia early on wednesday and then traveling to the west to spend the day in mali .
praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero landowner in the times of german colonial rule .
many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .
tens of thousands of the native herero tribe lost their lives during a 1904-07 uprising against the german occupation .
members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .
fischer added that germany stood by its past .
fischer flies on to cape town on friday to participate in a discussion at the university of cape town titled : can the un meet the challenges of the 21st century ? - the need for german-south african co-operation .
he will also hold talks with south africa 's speaker of parliament frene ginwala and visit german development initiatives in the city on saturday before concluding his three-nation africa trip . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a marshall plan for africa - sort of the g8 leaders gathering in canada this week want to unveil a new action plan to reduce poverty , corruption , stop the spread of aids in africa .

cornerstone for peace the german deputy chancellor declared that his country believed that south africa was “ one of the most important , possibly even the most important , voice in africa ” and added that the southern african region should be the cornerstone for peace , stability and development on the continent .

returning to his main theme of the situation in mugabe 's country , fischer said , “ zimbabwe could be in a similar situation .
its potential is great and it is a pity , a real drama , the situation in which the country is in . ”
fischer also addressed the role of german pharmaceutical companies and the need to make access to hiv / aids drugs easier for people living in developing countries .
“ we have the political but also the moral responsibility to do the utmost and to bring all the pharmaceutical possibilities to the developing countries , ” he said .
fischer arrived in south africa on thursday after visiting namibia early on wednesday and then traveling to the west to spend the day in mali .
praise for land reforms while in namibia , fischer expressed satisfaction with the way namibia has managed its land reform program and the allocation of property to resettled farmers , and gave germany ’ s promise to back the process and country financially , technically and with legal expertise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonial-era housing in windhoek , namibia .
taking questions during sessions at the state house in windhoek , the namibian capital , fischer said that the discussions on land reform had been both " constructive and productive , " adding " what we can do , we will do .
we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a herero landowner in the times of german colonial rule .
many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .
tens of thousands of the native herero tribe lost their lives during a 1904-07 uprising against the german occupation .
members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .
fischer added that germany stood by its past .
fischer flies on to cape town on friday to participate in a discussion at the university of cape town titled : can the un meet the challenges of the 21st century ? - the need for german-south african co-operation .

we will also push for the eu to support namibia .
land reform is an important issue in namibia and the region . "
financial aid on its way germany has already pledged to pump € 23 million euros , the equivalent of around 186.3 million namibian dollars , into the country ’ s economy over the next two years , thereby helping to fund road improvement , land reform , rural development , natural resources and economic growth .
the german government has also earmarked around € 16 million euro to be used for financial assistance , while € 7 million will be used for technical assistance in construction and regeneration projects .
a further € 4.2 million from a previous two-year co-operation agreement was re-allocated to namibia .
however , fischer indicated that the german economy would have to improve before berlin could push through the planned financial support .
“ once the economic turnaround has happened in germany , we can engage ourselves more actively again , ” he said .
call for colonial apology but despite the generosity in both tone and financial assistance , the german foreign minister came under fire from some sections of the namibian government on the subject of germany ’ s record as the colonial master of the country in the late 19th and early 20th century .

many have called for germany to apologize officially for the ruthless suppression of rebellions in namibia during german colonial rule .
tens of thousands of the native herero tribe lost their lives during a 1904-07 uprising against the german occupation .
members of the 120,000-strong tribe have filed a lawsuit in the united states demanding reparations from the german government and companies that allegedly benefited from german rule . fischer , however , ruled out any official statement of apology .
“ i can not make any utterance about reparations , ” he said after a working lunch with president sam nujoma .
fischer added that germany stood by its past .
fischer flies on to cape town on friday to participate in a discussion at the university of cape town titled : can the un meet the challenges of the 21st century ? - the need for german-south african co-operation .
he will also hold talks with south africa 's speaker of parliament frene ginwala and visit german development initiatives in the city on saturday before concluding his three-nation africa trip . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a marshall plan for africa - sort of the g8 leaders gathering in canada this week want to unveil a new action plan to reduce poverty , corruption , stop the spread of aids in africa .

dr simon murch was involved in the original research that led to fears among some parents that the combined measles , mumps and rubella jab was linked to autism .
he has consistently said there is no proven link between the jab and autism and now , writing in the lancet , he has warned that mmr uptake as low as 60 % in some areas is leaving british children vulnerable to disease .
another of the original authors of the research , dr andrew wakefield , has suggested there is fresh unpublished evidence of a link .
however , the department of health has strongly rebutted his claim - made to the bbc - that this was presented to government officials .
they say that no new research has emerged to support fears over mmr .
report author dr murch 's warning comes after scottish health officials said the incidence of suspected or confirmed mumps cases rose by 27 % , rubella by 22 % and measles by 18 % in children under 15 over the past 18 months .
dr murch , of the centre for paediatric gastroenterology at the royal free hospital in london , was one of the authors of a 1998 paper published in the lancet which looked the connection between inflammatory bowel disease and autistic disorders .
the paper found a connection between bowel problems and autism but did not conclude that mmr was connected to this .
however dr wakefield , the lead author of the paper , sparked a storm when he went on to raise fears of a link between the combined jab and autism , and recommended the use of single measles , mumps and rubella vaccines instead .
there is now unequivocal evidence that mmr is not a risk factor for autism dr simon murch q & a : mmr fears while dr murch 's name was on the original lancet paper , he has always advocated continuing with mmr jabs .
writing in this week 's lancet , dr murch states that there is unequivocal evidence supporting the safety of the mmr vaccine .
" no other vaccine has ever been studied in such depth , and the evidence for its overall safety is comprehensive .
he adds : " that any reports that characteristic gut inflammation in autistic children are reported in the media as supporting the idea that mmr is causative is deeply frustrating , since it is simply not so . "
unless vaccine uptake improves rapidly , major measles epidemics are likely in the uk this winter dr simon murch timeline of mmr research dr murch adds : " mmr immunisation , which should be an easy decision , has become a worrying issue for many british parents .
" although this situation reflects in part a broader mistrust of official pronouncements , and has been fuelled by media campaigning , it is founded on the misinformed perception that there is ongoing scientific uncertainty .
" there is now unequivocal evidence that mmr is not a risk factor for autism - this statement is not spin or medical conspiracy , but reflects an unprecedented volume of medical study on a worldwide basis .
" an unprotected child is not only at personal danger , but represents a potential hazard to others , including unborn children .
unless vaccine uptake improves rapidly , major measles epidemics are likely in the uk this winter . "
he told the bbc : " you take acceptable risks all the time .
i think that anybody who tries to say there is no risk attached to any medical intervention is actually being disingenuous .
" what i 'm saying is that the level of risk is clearly extremely small .
and the risk attached to not giving mmr is much , much greater . "

andrew dundas , uk send us your comments dr wakefield , however , told the bbc that a number of scientists were " increasingly worried " about the possibility of a link between mmr and some cases of autism .
he said : " i can tell you that senior members of the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation in their capacities as expert advisers to the vaccine manufacturers , have been presented with compelling evidence of a link between mmr , bowel disease in children with autism .. "

however dr wakefield , the lead author of the paper , sparked a storm when he went on to raise fears of a link between the combined jab and autism , and recommended the use of single measles , mumps and rubella vaccines instead .
there is now unequivocal evidence that mmr is not a risk factor for autism dr simon murch q & a : mmr fears while dr murch 's name was on the original lancet paper , he has always advocated continuing with mmr jabs .
writing in this week 's lancet , dr murch states that there is unequivocal evidence supporting the safety of the mmr vaccine .
" no other vaccine has ever been studied in such depth , and the evidence for its overall safety is comprehensive .
he adds : " that any reports that characteristic gut inflammation in autistic children are reported in the media as supporting the idea that mmr is causative is deeply frustrating , since it is simply not so . "
unless vaccine uptake improves rapidly , major measles epidemics are likely in the uk this winter dr simon murch timeline of mmr research dr murch adds : " mmr immunisation , which should be an easy decision , has become a worrying issue for many british parents .
" although this situation reflects in part a broader mistrust of official pronouncements , and has been fuelled by media campaigning , it is founded on the misinformed perception that there is ongoing scientific uncertainty .
" there is now unequivocal evidence that mmr is not a risk factor for autism - this statement is not spin or medical conspiracy , but reflects an unprecedented volume of medical study on a worldwide basis .
" an unprotected child is not only at personal danger , but represents a potential hazard to others , including unborn children .
unless vaccine uptake improves rapidly , major measles epidemics are likely in the uk this winter . "
he told the bbc : " you take acceptable risks all the time .
i think that anybody who tries to say there is no risk attached to any medical intervention is actually being disingenuous .
" what i 'm saying is that the level of risk is clearly extremely small .
and the risk attached to not giving mmr is much , much greater . "
have your say parents who refuse the mmr jab are helping to spread disease to other people 's children .
andrew dundas , uk send us your comments dr wakefield , however , told the bbc that a number of scientists were " increasingly worried " about the possibility of a link between mmr and some cases of autism .
he said : " i can tell you that senior members of the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation in their capacities as expert advisers to the vaccine manufacturers , have been presented with compelling evidence of a link between mmr , bowel disease in children with autism .. "
he said he was not in a position to disclose any more information about this evidence .

iain leslie , 52 , admitted driving the 13-year-old girl to secluded areas and abusing her four times .
leslie , of muirends croft , munlochy , ross-shire , was jailed for 10 weeks on thursday and placed on the sex offenders ' register for seven years .
scotland 's biggest charity for people with learning disabilities branded the sentence " outrageous " .
enable warned that it would not deter other offenders from preying on the vulnerable .
it acts as no deterrent that someone can engage in these practices and receive such soft treatment mike holmes enable mike holmes , the charity 's director of campaigns , said : " what 's particularly appalling is the leniency of this sentence .
it 's outrageous this guy got 10 weeks .
" children are vulnerable but children with learning difficulties are particularly vulnerable .
" it acts as no deterrent that someone can engage in these practices and receive such soft treatment .
this should have merited a more severe sentence . "
procurator fiscal roderick urquhart told dingwall sheriff court that the girl , who suffers from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , was particularly vulnerable and suffered from poor co-ordination and poor self-esteem .
farm visits mr urquhart told the court that the girl , who had developed an obsession with animals , went to visit leslie at his farm to feed his calves .
concerns raised by other members of the public about the visits led to social work and police inquiries , but nothing came of them at the time .
the court heard that when the girl 's older brother found out that she had sneaked out of her house to meet leslie after her parents had gone to bed , he decided to investigate .
this is the clearest case of grooming that i have seen for some considerable time roderick urquhart procurator fiscal mr urquhart said that after the offences came to light , leslie 's car was forensically examined .
he told the courts : " this is the clearest case of grooming that i have seen for some considerable time . "
leslie 's solicitor john robb told the court that his client 's wife had decided to stand by him but the sheriff ignored his pleas for a sentence of community service .
leslie admitted using lewd , indecent and libidinous practices against the girl on four occasions between 1 december , 2002 , and 21 january , 2003 .
sheriff alastair mcfadyen told livestock farmer leslie that he would not be doing his public duty if he imposed anything other than a custodial sentence .

ikea , the swedish furniture giant , expects to welcome 15,000 people a day following its opening in the capital .
the company has given cardiff council £ 3m towards traffic improvements .
but local residents say they are deeply concerned that this will not be enough .
the ikea store , which sells home furnishings , is the first one to be opened in wales - and will be the second largest in the uk .
wherever they have opened , the stores have been hugely successful , and store-manager theresa daly believes the one in cardiff will be no exception .
council contractors are working around the clock widening roads and roundabouts and putting in new traffic lights .
but residents who live near cardiff industrial estate where the store has been built say more needs to be done .
it is estimated that almost two million people live within an hour 's drive of the store .
ikea founder ingvar kamprad but it can only be accessed via the m4 to the west , through cardiff bay and through grangetown .
there are also fears that the city could experience gridlock when the store opens on november 6 as the wales rally gb begins in the bay on the same day .
organisers are working with the county council to try to avoid traffic chaos but senior councillor michael michael has warned people to expect delays .
" routes into the site are likely to be busy , especially around the ferry road junction of the a4232 , and we would encourage residents and visitors to the city to plan their journeys carefully and to allow plenty of time to reach their destinations , " he said .
the ikea store has a 1,200-space car park , but it is expected that all spaces will be filled early on in its 12-hour opening day and the weekend following .
a spokeswoman for the swedish furniture giant said that a number of initiatives were being discussed to help ease congestion .

old city housing is being demolished to make way for skyscrapers the issue has been in the spotlight after a series of incidents where people set fire to themselves to protest against their forced eviction .
it is a situation which is becoming increasingly common in china 's cities , where dilapidated housing is being knocked down to make way for gleaming new skyscrapers .
but the details printed in the china daily are a shocking illustration of the lengths some property developers will go to .
in one case several people staged a night raid on a house in beijing , tied up the family living there , and demolished their home , burying their possession in the ruins .
in the other case , six people were injured when 13 homes were illegally destroyed .
the newspaper said five people have been detained , two are still at large .
it also quotes an official as saying more would be done to guarantee the interests of households relocated due to building work .
there is rising public anger over the scant regard paid to the rights of homeowners .
that has culminated in a series of recent suicide attempts by people forced to relocate against their will and an increasing number of small-scale protests over the issue .

alitalia 's board said it expects the airline 's operating loss to rise to 410m euros -lrb- $ 480m ; £ 281m -rrb- this year , up from 118m euros last year .
a board meeting on thursday agreed to a restructuring plan , made up of job cuts , outsourcing and fresh investment .
alitalia 's board said it wants to spend 1.2bn euros to modernise its planes over the next three years .
survival strategies airlines are still struggling to overcome the damage to their profits inflicted by the 2001 attack on the world trade centre , which led to a drop in business travel .
a wave of consolidations is taking place among european airlines .

the new road network could be the envy of many countries the network - made up of 85,000km - has been so neglected in the past that in many areas it has deteriorated beyond repair .
this has forced people travelling to the northern city of mwanza from dar es salaam to pass through the kenyan capital , nairobi - a detour of several hundred kilometres .
it is hoped that new roads - not just in mwanza but across the whole of tanzania - will boost the local economy and help to reduce poverty .
" it is important because it is one of the major factors of economic growth in any country ... it eases transportation of goods , whether agricultural or industrial goods , imports or exports , " says mr leopold mujjungi who is in charge of trunk roads in the ministry of works .
commerce mr majungi says that the new road network will also ease communication between tanzania and the neighbouring countries of rwanda and burundi .
" people will get easier access because there is no damage to their cars , no potholes and there is a saving in travelling time , and along the new road a lot of commercial activities are coming up , " he says .
in the case of mwanza the new road system is impacting on the health of ordinary people .
" people were inhaling a lot of dust from morning to dusk which has been affecting even their health , " said mr majungi .
" but now we have a new paved road with no dust at all " .
donors the biggest donor in the road rebuilding programme is the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- which is spending up to $ 40m a year .
" it requires a lot of resources ... the government is putting in some of the resources but the needs are huge because tanzania is such a huge country . that even to maintain the current network of roads requires a lot of resources , " says william hanna , head of the eu in tanzania .
the economic benefits will be considerable many of the tarmac roads in tanzania were built over 10 years ago and have almost completely disintegrated and mr hanna says that the eu has listed maintenance as one of the conditions for assistance in the building of new roads .
" a few years ago it came to a point where we could not assist tanzania in the construction of new roads unless the question of maintenance was properly addressed , " said mr hanna .
when the mwanza road project ends early next year it is hoped that tanzanians will by then be reaping the many benefits that new roads can bring .

green-fingered terry walton , 57 , a regular on the bbc 's jeremy vine show , started giving his pumpkin plants real ale after hearing it would encourage them to grow .
using the slops saved from a local pub , terry gave his plants a weekly cocktail of the finest real ale found in south wales .
the plants soon responded , one growing to a massive 32 lb - the weight of the average two-year-old child .
this week , he picked the biggest of three huge pumpkins from his vegetable patch in tonypandy , rhondda and donated it to the bobath charity which helps children across wales with cerebral palsy .
" this is the first time i have ever tried growing pumpkins and i have to say i am pretty pleased with the results , " said terry .
from small acorns : terry grew the giant pumpkin from this seed " the secret is definitely feeding them beer , but not any old beer - real ale is the best .
" i 've been collecting the slops from a local pub a couple of times a week since i started growing them .
" and it seems to have worked wonders .
i have had this one and i 've got another two at home which are the size of footballs . "
earlier this year , terry 's allotment was " adopted " by bbc radio two 's jeremy vine show and he has become a regular on the lunchtime programme talking about the progress of his garden .
the retired company director has been gardening at the plot since he was 13 .
" when i started on jeremy 's show , someone told me that pumpkins like beer so i thought i would try it , " he said .
" i 've never grown pumpkins before but last year my daughter-in-law bought me some pumpkin seeds so i thought i would try it .
" and as this one turned out so well , i think i will try it again next year , but i 'm going to try and grow an even bigger one . "
terry decided to donate the biggest pumpkin to the bobath children 's therapy centre based in cardiff which helps children across wales with cerebral palsy who are running a name-the-pumpkin competition .
" we were thrilled when terry decided to give us his giant pumpkin , " said linda nash of bobath .
" every penny we raise goes to the therapy of children with cerebral palsy across wales , " she added .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- profile : mahathir mohamad bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 09:21 gmt , friday , 31 october 2003 profile : mahathir mohamad malaysia 's mahathir mohamad towered over his country 's politics for more than two decades .
while his colourful reputation abroad stemmed from frequent barbed comments about the west and his scant regard for human rights , his authoritarian but essentially pragmatic policies at home won him much popular support and helped transform malaysia into an asian economic tiger .
during the process he turned himself into one of asia 's longest-serving leader , and when he retired in october he had been in office for 22 years .
throughout his rule dr mahathir , 77 , took a tough stand against those who opposed him or threatened his power .
anwar ibrahim , once his deputy and heir apparent , is still serving a jail sentence he began in 1998 after the prime minister abruptly dismissed him from his cabinet post and accused him of sodomy and corruption .
more recently , dr mahathir was accused of using the us-led war on terrorism as an excuse to neutralise islamic political opponents at home .
scores of suspected militants have been arrested without trial under the much-criticised internal security act . "
muslims today have reached the lowest point of their development . "
mahathir mohamad mahathir in his own words in the immediate aftermath of the september 11 attacks dr mahathir offered his full support and cooperation to the united states and projected himself as a moderate spokesman for the muslim world .
but he was furious when he himself was subjected to rigorous security checks at a us airport .
he said american " anti-muslim hysteria " had led to him being treated like a terrorist .
and he said the attacks on afghanistan and then iraq could degenerate into a campaign against the developing world as a whole .
favouring malays since dr mahathir became prime minister in 1981 , government patronage and positive ethnic discrimination in employment and higher education have created a malay middle class , including some billionaires .
but the ethnic chinese minority is still seen as having disproportionate wealth , and the prime minister has frequently accused his fellow malays -lrb- or bumiputras - " sons of the soil " -rrb- of being complacent and unwilling to work hard .
" i feel disappointed " , dr mahathir said before he stepped down , " because i have achieved too little in my principal task of making my race a successful race , a race that is respected . "
mahathir mohamad 's political career began in 1946 , when at the age of 21 he joined the newly founded nationalist organisation united malays national organisation -lrb- umno -rrb- .
he studied medicine at the university of malaya and for seven years ran a private medical practice in his home state of kedah .
" dr m " , as he is popularly known , became an umno member of parliament in 1964 .
but in 1969 he lost his seat and was expelled from the party after releasing an open letter attacking the then prime minister , tunku abdul rahman , for neglecting the malay community .
exiled to the political wilderness , he developed his ideas in a controversial book entitled the malay dilemma .
he wrote that the malays had been marginalised during the colonial era and castigated them for apathetically accepting their second-class status .
anti-colonialist rhetoric it set the tone for future attacks on western neo-colonialists and others he sees as bent on subjugating malaysia and threatening its success .
the malay dilemma struck such a chord with younger umno leaders that he was invited back into the party , re-elected to parliament in 1974 , and appointed minister of education .
within four years he had become deputy leader of umno , and in 1981 he became prime minister .
dr mahathir set about putting his ideas into practice , following the example set by japan , transforming malaysia from an exporter of rubber and tin into a manufacturer of electronic equipment , steel and cars .
defending asian and malaysian values , he criticised what he called western double standards and won a following among developing countries .
his prestige projects to boost national pride included the world 's tallest building - the petronas towers - and the transformation of a palm oil plantation near the capital into the world 's first " multimedia super corridor " - a cyber powerhouse intended to rival california 's silicon valley .
with the onset of the asian economic crisis in 1997 , dr mahathir refused to accept that his grandiose schemes were partly to blame for malaysia 's massive debt .
instead he blamed foreign currency traders , including the financier george soros , for what he termed a worldwide jewish conspiracy .
malaysia emerged relatively unscathed from the asian financial crisis after dr mahathir defied the international monetary fund , introducing controversial currency controls which effectively isolated his country from the global economy .
but relations with the west have continued to fluctuate .
in june this year dr mahathir described westerners - or more particularly " anglo-saxon europeans " - as proponents of " war , sodomy and genocide " .
days before he resigned , he angered several foreign governments and jewish groups by claiming the a jewish cabal " ruled the world " .

his prestige projects to boost national pride included the world 's tallest building - the petronas towers - and the transformation of a palm oil plantation near the capital into the world 's first " multimedia super corridor " - a cyber powerhouse intended to rival california 's silicon valley .
with the onset of the asian economic crisis in 1997 , dr mahathir refused to accept that his grandiose schemes were partly to blame for malaysia 's massive debt .
instead he blamed foreign currency traders , including the financier george soros , for what he termed a worldwide jewish conspiracy .
malaysia emerged relatively unscathed from the asian financial crisis after dr mahathir defied the international monetary fund , introducing controversial currency controls which effectively isolated his country from the global economy .

while his colourful reputation abroad stemmed from frequent barbed comments about the west and his scant regard for human rights , his authoritarian but essentially pragmatic policies at home won him much popular support and helped transform malaysia into an asian economic tiger .
during the process he turned himself into one of asia 's longest-serving leader , and when he retired in october he had been in office for 22 years .
throughout his rule dr mahathir , 77 , took a tough stand against those who opposed him or threatened his power .
anwar ibrahim , once his deputy and heir apparent , is still serving a jail sentence he began in 1998 after the prime minister abruptly dismissed him from his cabinet post and accused him of sodomy and corruption .
more recently , dr mahathir was accused of using the us-led war on terrorism as an excuse to neutralise islamic political opponents at home .

muslims today have reached the lowest point of their development .
mahathir mohamad mahathir in his own words in the immediate aftermath of the september 11 attacks dr mahathir offered his full support and cooperation to the united states and projected himself as a moderate spokesman for the muslim world .
but he was furious when he himself was subjected to rigorous security checks at a us airport .
he said american " anti-muslim hysteria " had led to him being treated like a terrorist .
and he said the attacks on afghanistan and then iraq could degenerate into a campaign against the developing world as a whole .
favouring malays since dr mahathir became prime minister in 1981 , government patronage and positive ethnic discrimination in employment and higher education have created a malay middle class , including some billionaires .

malaysia was transformed under dr mahathir 's rule exiled to the political wilderness , he developed his ideas in a controversial book entitled the malay dilemma .
he wrote that the malays had been marginalised during the colonial era and castigated them for apathetically accepting their second-class status .
anti-colonialist rhetoric it set the tone for future attacks on western neo-colonialists and others he sees as bent on subjugating malaysia and threatening its success .
the malay dilemma struck such a chord with younger umno leaders that he was invited back into the party , re-elected to parliament in 1974 , and appointed minister of education .

twenty-something jazz superstars - especially british ones - are as rare as snow in the sahara .
record companies rarely spend much on promoting jazz , assuming the audience is discerning enough to make up its own mind .
and as it is still a minority interest , there is scant return on what little investment there is .
but one young man from wiltshire might just be about to change all that .
million-pound deal jamie cullum , at 23 hardly out of nappies in jazz terms , signed a £ 1m record deal earlier this year .
for his album twentysomething , the man at the controls is stewart levine , who has produced bb king and george benson among others .
and it really pays dividends here .
so is young cullum as good as all the hype ? 23-year-old cullum is a " sensational " piano player just one listen to twentysomething suggests he most certainly is .
subsequent playings only confirm it .
you assume from his voice that he has been playing smoke-filled jazz clubs for years .
what sorts the men from the boys in jazz is phrasing and performance - and jamie 's is inventive and accomplished .
many have compared cullum with harry connick jr .
but there is also a touch of randy newman here , mixed with a dose of sting and a sprinkling of latter-day georgie fame - which is not bad for starters .
twentysomething features a good helping of standards and some originals from the pen of cullum and brother ben .
' beautiful support ' the former are stronger as you would expect , though the newer material does not lack quality .
i get a kick out of you gets a good makeover , and there is a powerful new setting for i could have danced all night .
there 's almost a lifetime of music still to come from jamie cullum my favourite is a version of singing in the rain , which squeezes something extra from one of the greatest melodies of all time .
the other musicians give beautifully-produced support .
oh and did i not mention ?
cullum plays piano sensationally too .
this is the artist 's first professionally put-together record after two self-financed attempts .
and the good thing is , there is still almost a lifetime of music to come from jamie cullum .
twentysomething is out now on universal records so what do you think ?
is jamie cullum worth all the hype ?
or were you underwhelmed ?
this debate is now closed .
please see below for a selection of your comments .
i bought this album after amazon suggested it , having never heard of the guy ... and i am not disappointed .
twentysomething , the title track , is really catchy ... and jamie 's voice is as stated , very much older and wiser sounding than his years .
richard , uk twentysomething is a brilliant follow up to pointless nostalgic .
i think it 's so refreshing to see someone with real talent with both amazing vocals , a unique style and real songwriting ability .
all at sea has got to be one of the best tracks all round , although his version of blame it on my youth is one of the most poignant tracks i 've ever heard .
this is what people should be listening to rather than this mass market contrived pop and he deserves to sell millions !
laura williams , uk jamie cullum is the real thing .
i saw him down at hmv and he was sensational - a genuinely captivating performer .
this album is awesome - loads of variety , some killer ballads , masses of energy and some superb originals too .
i can see a long long future ahead of jamie .
tom hayes , uk i agree with sally and am glad someone else recognises that this is cheesy pop from someone that can actually play !
i saw jamie cullum live a week before i read about his million pound deal on bbc news .
at the time i had never even heard of him , and , unaffected by the hype , i left after his first set .
true , he has a very strong voice and can certainly tinkle on the old ivories compared to your average chart topping pop star ... but not anywhere near to the standard that i would expect to hear at a top jazz gig .
in response to the bbc comment " the other musicians give beautifully-produced support " - well he must have a different sax player from when i saw him with ? !
i say very good luck to jamie cullum , he is obviously a very talented man .
but i have to agree , again , with sally , it is a bit of insult to the many great british jazz musicians out there who are pushing the genre to new depths , rather than repeating what has been said before , many times .
pushing boundaries is , after all , what jazz is all about !
howard king , uk i just saw jamie perform on parkinson , and he was fabulous .
this is n't usually the kind of music i like , but i will be buying the album a.s.a.p !
kate , uk this is a real feel good , fun album , i love all at sea and i could have danced best .
great stuff .
we are going to see him live in manchester in a few weeks , and i ca n't wait .
sarah , uk the most important british album to emerge this century .
genius !
mark emms , uk a really perfect album , with just the right amount of laid back grooves .
i would recommend it for anyone !
plus the fact that jamie is drop dead gorgeous , and a really nice guy ... you ca n't help but love him !
i know for sure i 'll be listening to it over and over again ...
caroline mason-rietveld , uk i certainly think jamie is worth all the hype .
there is bound to be criticism from staunch " jazzers " who believe that jamie 's album is too mainstream , but with all their moaning and groaning about keeping jazz " real " , they 're actually missing the point - that this is a great album , however you categorise it .
laura peters , uk saw jamie in leeds , as this guy is gonna be big !
he 's done a great cover of radiohead 's high and dry and is the next big thing to hit the music scene .
his whole genre of music is both young and fresh .
rock on jamie !
mannie , uk fantastic .
his last album was very good and this is even better .
amazing voice and great composition .
everyone should go out of their way to listen to this stars new album , they wo n't be disappointed .
mark , uk it 's lightweight rubbish for those who are afraid of real jazz but want to think they 're hip .
there 's nothing new or exciting here , just a load of hype - an insult to genuine hard-working british jazzers with original talent who slog day in , day out with no mainstream recongnition when they are in fact creating fantastic , challenging , original and in many cases dangerous music .
sally , uk i have to say this is a great album .
this guy has an unbelievable voice for a 23 year old - he sounds like he 's been doing the jazz club circuit for decades .
great new spins on old classics and the orignal songs are top value .
highly recommended paul trevillian , uk i saw jamie perform at the queens hall in edinburgh and he was just fantastic .
a very charismatic performer with lots of energy .
what a great night !
ca n't wait to see him again at king tuts .
both albums are wonderful - i just wish that he had added his own version of the doors " light my fire " to twentysomething - it was sensational !
amanda , scotland go buy this album ! ! !
i have seen jamie three times and he gets better every time .
he is a born performer and his enthusiasm for jazz is infectious .
i am counting the days until i see him at the festival hall next month .
if you get the chance to see him - go !
jordana chapman , uk i saw jamie perform at the oak room in new york city on 10 october , and he was fabulous .
he 's not only very talented , he 's also a good showman .
i could have sat listening to him for hours .

i think it 's so refreshing to see someone with real talent with both amazing vocals , a unique style and real songwriting ability .
all at sea has got to be one of the best tracks all round , although his version of blame it on my youth is one of the most poignant tracks i 've ever heard .
this is what people should be listening to rather than this mass market contrived pop and he deserves to sell millions !
laura williams , uk jamie cullum is the real thing .
i saw him down at hmv and he was sensational - a genuinely captivating performer .
this album is awesome - loads of variety , some killer ballads , masses of energy and some superb originals too .
i can see a long long future ahead of jamie .
tom hayes , uk i agree with sally and am glad someone else recognises that this is cheesy pop from someone that can actually play !
i saw jamie cullum live a week before i read about his million pound deal on bbc news .
at the time i had never even heard of him , and , unaffected by the hype , i left after his first set .
true , he has a very strong voice and can certainly tinkle on the old ivories compared to your average chart topping pop star ... but not anywhere near to the standard that i would expect to hear at a top jazz gig .
in response to the bbc comment " the other musicians give beautifully-produced support " - well he must have a different sax player from when i saw him with ? !
i say very good luck to jamie cullum , he is obviously a very talented man .
but i have to agree , again , with sally , it is a bit of insult to the many great british jazz musicians out there who are pushing the genre to new depths , rather than repeating what has been said before , many times .
pushing boundaries is , after all , what jazz is all about !
howard king , uk i just saw jamie perform on parkinson , and he was fabulous .
this is n't usually the kind of music i like , but i will be buying the album a.s.a.p !
kate , uk this is a real feel good , fun album , i love all at sea and i could have danced best .
great stuff .
we are going to see him live in manchester in a few weeks , and i ca n't wait .
sarah , uk the most important british album to emerge this century .
genius !
mark emms , uk a really perfect album , with just the right amount of laid back grooves .
i would recommend it for anyone !
plus the fact that jamie is drop dead gorgeous , and a really nice guy ... you ca n't help but love him !
i know for sure i 'll be listening to it over and over again ...
caroline mason-rietveld , uk i certainly think jamie is worth all the hype .
there is bound to be criticism from staunch " jazzers " who believe that jamie 's album is too mainstream , but with all their moaning and groaning about keeping jazz " real " , they 're actually missing the point - that this is a great album , however you categorise it .
laura peters , uk saw jamie in leeds , as this guy is gonna be big !
he 's done a great cover of radiohead 's high and dry and is the next big thing to hit the music scene .
his whole genre of music is both young and fresh .
rock on jamie !
mannie , uk fantastic .
his last album was very good and this is even better .
amazing voice and great composition .
everyone should go out of their way to listen to this stars new album , they wo n't be disappointed .
mark , uk it 's lightweight rubbish for those who are afraid of real jazz but want to think they 're hip .
there 's nothing new or exciting here , just a load of hype - an insult to genuine hard-working british jazzers with original talent who slog day in , day out with no mainstream recongnition when they are in fact creating fantastic , challenging , original and in many cases dangerous music .
sally , uk i have to say this is a great album .
this guy has an unbelievable voice for a 23 year old - he sounds like he 's been doing the jazz club circuit for decades .
great new spins on old classics and the orignal songs are top value .
highly recommended paul trevillian , uk i saw jamie perform at the queens hall in edinburgh and he was just fantastic .
a very charismatic performer with lots of energy .
what a great night !
ca n't wait to see him again at king tuts .
both albums are wonderful - i just wish that he had added his own version of the doors " light my fire " to twentysomething - it was sensational !
amanda , scotland go buy this album ! ! !
i have seen jamie three times and he gets better every time .
he is a born performer and his enthusiasm for jazz is infectious .
i am counting the days until i see him at the festival hall next month .
if you get the chance to see him - go !
jordana chapman , uk i saw jamie perform at the oak room in new york city on 10 october , and he was fabulous .
he 's not only very talented , he 's also a good showman .
i could have sat listening to him for hours .

twenty-something jazz superstars - especially british ones - are as rare as snow in the sahara .
record companies rarely spend much on promoting jazz , assuming the audience is discerning enough to make up its own mind .
and as it is still a minority interest , there is scant return on what little investment there is .
but one young man from wiltshire might just be about to change all that .
million-pound deal jamie cullum , at 23 hardly out of nappies in jazz terms , signed a £ 1m record deal earlier this year .
for his album twentysomething , the man at the controls is stewart levine , who has produced bb king and george benson among others .
and it really pays dividends here .
so is young cullum as good as all the hype ? 23-year-old cullum is a " sensational " piano player just one listen to twentysomething suggests he most certainly is .
subsequent playings only confirm it .
you assume from his voice that he has been playing smoke-filled jazz clubs for years .
what sorts the men from the boys in jazz is phrasing and performance - and jamie 's is inventive and accomplished .
many have compared cullum with harry connick jr .
but there is also a touch of randy newman here , mixed with a dose of sting and a sprinkling of latter-day georgie fame - which is not bad for starters .
twentysomething features a good helping of standards and some originals from the pen of cullum and brother ben .
' beautiful support ' the former are stronger as you would expect , though the newer material does not lack quality .
i get a kick out of you gets a good makeover , and there is a powerful new setting for i could have danced all night .
there 's almost a lifetime of music still to come from jamie cullum my favourite is a version of singing in the rain , which squeezes something extra from one of the greatest melodies of all time .
the other musicians give beautifully-produced support .
oh and did i not mention ?
cullum plays piano sensationally too .
this is the artist 's first professionally put-together record after two self-financed attempts .
and the good thing is , there is still almost a lifetime of music to come from jamie cullum .
twentysomething is out now on universal records so what do you think ?

twenty-something jazz superstars - especially british ones - are as rare as snow in the sahara .
record companies rarely spend much on promoting jazz , assuming the audience is discerning enough to make up its own mind .
and as it is still a minority interest , there is scant return on what little investment there is .
but one young man from wiltshire might just be about to change all that .
million-pound deal jamie cullum , at 23 hardly out of nappies in jazz terms , signed a £ 1m record deal earlier this year .
for his album twentysomething , the man at the controls is stewart levine , who has produced bb king and george benson among others .
and it really pays dividends here .
so is young cullum as good as all the hype ? 23-year-old cullum is a " sensational " piano player just one listen to twentysomething suggests he most certainly is .
subsequent playings only confirm it .
you assume from his voice that he has been playing smoke-filled jazz clubs for years .
what sorts the men from the boys in jazz is phrasing and performance - and jamie 's is inventive and accomplished .
many have compared cullum with harry connick jr .
but there is also a touch of randy newman here , mixed with a dose of sting and a sprinkling of latter-day georgie fame - which is not bad for starters .
twentysomething features a good helping of standards and some originals from the pen of cullum and brother ben .
' beautiful support ' the former are stronger as you would expect , though the newer material does not lack quality .
i get a kick out of you gets a good makeover , and there is a powerful new setting for i could have danced all night .
there 's almost a lifetime of music still to come from jamie cullum my favourite is a version of singing in the rain , which squeezes something extra from one of the greatest melodies of all time .
the other musicians give beautifully-produced support .
oh and did i not mention ?
cullum plays piano sensationally too .
this is the artist 's first professionally put-together record after two self-financed attempts .
and the good thing is , there is still almost a lifetime of music to come from jamie cullum .
twentysomething is out now on universal records so what do you think ?
is jamie cullum worth all the hype ?
or were you underwhelmed ?
this debate is now closed .
please see below for a selection of your comments .
i bought this album after amazon suggested it , having never heard of the guy ... and i am not disappointed .
twentysomething , the title track , is really catchy ... and jamie 's voice is as stated , very much older and wiser sounding than his years .
richard , uk twentysomething is a brilliant follow up to pointless nostalgic .
i think it 's so refreshing to see someone with real talent with both amazing vocals , a unique style and real songwriting ability .
all at sea has got to be one of the best tracks all round , although his version of blame it on my youth is one of the most poignant tracks i 've ever heard .
this is what people should be listening to rather than this mass market contrived pop and he deserves to sell millions !
laura williams , uk jamie cullum is the real thing .
i saw him down at hmv and he was sensational - a genuinely captivating performer .
this album is awesome - loads of variety , some killer ballads , masses of energy and some superb originals too .
i can see a long long future ahead of jamie .
tom hayes , uk i agree with sally and am glad someone else recognises that this is cheesy pop from someone that can actually play !
i saw jamie cullum live a week before i read about his million pound deal on bbc news .
at the time i had never even heard of him , and , unaffected by the hype , i left after his first set .
true , he has a very strong voice and can certainly tinkle on the old ivories compared to your average chart topping pop star ... but not anywhere near to the standard that i would expect to hear at a top jazz gig .
in response to the bbc comment " the other musicians give beautifully-produced support " - well he must have a different sax player from when i saw him with ? !
i say very good luck to jamie cullum , he is obviously a very talented man .
but i have to agree , again , with sally , it is a bit of insult to the many great british jazz musicians out there who are pushing the genre to new depths , rather than repeating what has been said before , many times .
pushing boundaries is , after all , what jazz is all about !
howard king , uk i just saw jamie perform on parkinson , and he was fabulous .
this is n't usually the kind of music i like , but i will be buying the album a.s.a.p !
kate , uk this is a real feel good , fun album , i love all at sea and i could have danced best .
great stuff .
we are going to see him live in manchester in a few weeks , and i ca n't wait .
sarah , uk the most important british album to emerge this century .
genius !
mark emms , uk a really perfect album , with just the right amount of laid back grooves .
i would recommend it for anyone !
plus the fact that jamie is drop dead gorgeous , and a really nice guy ... you ca n't help but love him !
i know for sure i 'll be listening to it over and over again ...
caroline mason-rietveld , uk i certainly think jamie is worth all the hype .
there is bound to be criticism from staunch " jazzers " who believe that jamie 's album is too mainstream , but with all their moaning and groaning about keeping jazz " real " , they 're actually missing the point - that this is a great album , however you categorise it .
laura peters , uk saw jamie in leeds , as this guy is gonna be big !
he 's done a great cover of radiohead 's high and dry and is the next big thing to hit the music scene .
his whole genre of music is both young and fresh .
rock on jamie !
mannie , uk fantastic .
his last album was very good and this is even better .
amazing voice and great composition .
everyone should go out of their way to listen to this stars new album , they wo n't be disappointed .
mark , uk it 's lightweight rubbish for those who are afraid of real jazz but want to think they 're hip .
there 's nothing new or exciting here , just a load of hype - an insult to genuine hard-working british jazzers with original talent who slog day in , day out with no mainstream recongnition when they are in fact creating fantastic , challenging , original and in many cases dangerous music .
sally , uk i have to say this is a great album .
this guy has an unbelievable voice for a 23 year old - he sounds like he 's been doing the jazz club circuit for decades .
great new spins on old classics and the orignal songs are top value .
highly recommended paul trevillian , uk i saw jamie perform at the queens hall in edinburgh and he was just fantastic .
a very charismatic performer with lots of energy .
what a great night !
ca n't wait to see him again at king tuts .
both albums are wonderful - i just wish that he had added his own version of the doors " light my fire " to twentysomething - it was sensational !
amanda , scotland go buy this album ! ! !
i have seen jamie three times and he gets better every time .
he is a born performer and his enthusiasm for jazz is infectious .
i am counting the days until i see him at the festival hall next month .
if you get the chance to see him - go !
jordana chapman , uk i saw jamie perform at the oak room in new york city on 10 october , and he was fabulous .

moving on is its first fruit , an album that allows the royal academy of music graduate resume her position in front of the piano .
she aims to " eradicate the barriers between pop and classical music " , an approach that proved lucrative for violinist vanessa mae .
to this end , myleene 's solo debut is a collection of popular classics with a cover that shows her teetering atop a piano in a lacy dress .
but will she fall between two stools ?
restrained it opens with a stirring version of bach 's toccata , as the 25-year-old 's passionate playing leads a flurry of beats , strings and samples .
the album then settles into faithful versions of familiar pieces such elgar 's adagio , moonlight sonata and themes from gladiator and braveheart .
electronic pulses and gregorian chants enhance the orchestral sound , yet conservative production restrains these emotive tunes and rarely allows them to soar .
versions of the linkin park hit crawling -lrb- retitled " krwlng " -rrb- and daniel bedingfield 's ballad if you 're not the one prove intriguing but do not stray far from the original pop arrangements .
undemanding few hear 'say fans are likely to follow myleene 's move from safe pop to safe classics , having already defected to blue , beyonce and justin timberlake .
nevertheless the album makes undemanding background listening and could be a big hit with their parents .
it proves that yes - myleene can play , and no - she would n't be out of place on either top of the pops , classic fm or the pages of fhm .
moving on is a solid foundation for a solo career and should encourage myleene to pour more of herself into the follow-up .
moving on is out now on the universal classics and jazz label .
have you heard the album ?
what did you think ?
this debate is now closed .
please see a selection of your comments below .
myleene just made the right move .
her versions of pavane , gymnopedie and the braveheart theme are great - seriously .
with moonlight sonata , i 'm not sure though .
i think i 've heard a better version before .
comparing vanessa mae 's toccata with myleene 's , i think vanessa 's will be favoured by the " purists " while myleene 's version caters to the general public for the reason that it is shorter and more contemporary .
moving on is a very intimate album .
it can move your emotions to a higher level .
simply beautiful .
jonah , uk i bought moving on last week and i was not disappointed .
this album is simply gorgeous and would recommend it to anyone .
myleene deserves much praise and respect for this excellent debut .
steve noon , warwickshire , england the unfettered arrogance of her playing is astonishing and condescending in the extreme .
the fact remains that she is being marketed just as cynically as she was in hear 'say - bland , soulless production allied to a pretty face ... the universal label must be rubbing their hands waiting for the moeny to roll in .
the best classical music strives to engage , evoke and challenge .
klass ' lightweight effort only irritates with its insincerity .
there are far better young talents who are being criminally ignored .
andrew coombes , cardiff , wales this is probably unfair , but i watched the video clips and found them quite amusing .
sadly it appears as though the only way to make playing piano interesting is if you swish your hair from side to side rapidly .
i do n't doubt her ability , but really she should be popularising works that have been ignored , not dragging out done-to-death compositions out in banal , supposedly new versions .
maybe she should have a go at ravel 's ondine .
stuart reeves , uk you have to give myleene credit for not going down the road of so many manufactured pop stars ; either into drink and drug overload or trying to relaunch a sagging pop career by reinventing the same old formula in a different frock .
i wo n't say i 'm a fan of this one as it treads too much of the same old ground and could have done with some new tunes -lrb- acoustic alchemy style perhaps ? -rrb- but it 's nice enough to appeal on a broader front than hear 'say .
oh and for me she looks smashing too !
dave , kent , uk leo - never underestimate the power of a weighty cleavage .
stuart g cox , scotland myleene proved that she is a very talented musician .
the selections in the album will be enjoyed by the young and old alike .
an excellent album .
hope she 'll do a lot more to showcase her talent in playing other instrument like the harp and the violin .
charito modina , uk patronising .
anybody whose concentration span is even remotely intact should make the effort , hoist themselves off the couch , and go to a concert hall and see the music of beethoven and elgar played by real musicians .
breaking boundaries ?
no , just getting a huge amount of money to try - it will take more than a lacy number and weighty cleavage to fool me ...
leo , uk moving on is an amazing solo debut album for myleene .
as a hear 'say fan i was n't too sure if i would like it but i ca n't stop listening to it now .
each song is performed brilliantly and myleene shows she is much more than just a pretty face.this album will be suited for people who listen to classical and pop / r 'n'b and they wo n't be let down .

moving on is its first fruit , an album that allows the royal academy of music graduate resume her position in front of the piano .
she aims to " eradicate the barriers between pop and classical music " , an approach that proved lucrative for violinist vanessa mae .
to this end , myleene 's solo debut is a collection of popular classics with a cover that shows her teetering atop a piano in a lacy dress .
but will she fall between two stools ?
restrained it opens with a stirring version of bach 's toccata , as the 25-year-old 's passionate playing leads a flurry of beats , strings and samples .
the album then settles into faithful versions of familiar pieces such elgar 's adagio , moonlight sonata and themes from gladiator and braveheart .
electronic pulses and gregorian chants enhance the orchestral sound , yet conservative production restrains these emotive tunes and rarely allows them to soar .
versions of the linkin park hit crawling -lrb- retitled " krwlng " -rrb- and daniel bedingfield 's ballad if you 're not the one prove intriguing but do not stray far from the original pop arrangements .
undemanding few hear 'say fans are likely to follow myleene 's move from safe pop to safe classics , having already defected to blue , beyonce and justin timberlake .
nevertheless the album makes undemanding background listening and could be a big hit with their parents .
it proves that yes - myleene can play , and no - she would n't be out of place on either top of the pops , classic fm or the pages of fhm .
moving on is a solid foundation for a solo career and should encourage myleene to pour more of herself into the follow-up .
moving on is out now on the universal classics and jazz label .
have you heard the album ?

this debate is now closed .

myleene just made the right move .
her versions of pavane , gymnopedie and the braveheart theme are great - seriously .
with moonlight sonata , i 'm not sure though .
i think i 've heard a better version before .
comparing vanessa mae 's toccata with myleene 's , i think vanessa 's will be favoured by the " purists " while myleene 's version caters to the general public for the reason that it is shorter and more contemporary .
moving on is a very intimate album .
it can move your emotions to a higher level .
simply beautiful .

this album is simply gorgeous and would recommend it to anyone .

restrained it opens with a stirring version of bach 's toccata , as the 25-year-old 's passionate playing leads a flurry of beats , strings and samples .
the album then settles into faithful versions of familiar pieces such elgar 's adagio , moonlight sonata and themes from gladiator and braveheart .
electronic pulses and gregorian chants enhance the orchestral sound , yet conservative production restrains these emotive tunes and rarely allows them to soar .
versions of the linkin park hit crawling -lrb- retitled " krwlng " -rrb- and daniel bedingfield 's ballad if you 're not the one prove intriguing but do not stray far from the original pop arrangements .
undemanding few hear 'say fans are likely to follow myleene 's move from safe pop to safe classics , having already defected to blue , beyonce and justin timberlake .
nevertheless the album makes undemanding background listening and could be a big hit with their parents .
it proves that yes - myleene can play , and no - she would n't be out of place on either top of the pops , classic fm or the pages of fhm .
moving on is a solid foundation for a solo career and should encourage myleene to pour more of herself into the follow-up .
moving on is out now on the universal classics and jazz label .
have you heard the album ?
what did you think ?
this debate is now closed .
please see a selection of your comments below .
myleene just made the right move .
her versions of pavane , gymnopedie and the braveheart theme are great - seriously .
with moonlight sonata , i 'm not sure though .
i think i 've heard a better version before .
comparing vanessa mae 's toccata with myleene 's , i think vanessa 's will be favoured by the " purists " while myleene 's version caters to the general public for the reason that it is shorter and more contemporary .
moving on is a very intimate album .
it can move your emotions to a higher level .
simply beautiful .
jonah , uk i bought moving on last week and i was not disappointed .
this album is simply gorgeous and would recommend it to anyone .
myleene deserves much praise and respect for this excellent debut .
steve noon , warwickshire , england the unfettered arrogance of her playing is astonishing and condescending in the extreme .
the fact remains that she is being marketed just as cynically as she was in hear 'say - bland , soulless production allied to a pretty face ... the universal label must be rubbing their hands waiting for the moeny to roll in .
the best classical music strives to engage , evoke and challenge .
klass ' lightweight effort only irritates with its insincerity .
there are far better young talents who are being criminally ignored .
andrew coombes , cardiff , wales this is probably unfair , but i watched the video clips and found them quite amusing .
sadly it appears as though the only way to make playing piano interesting is if you swish your hair from side to side rapidly .
i do n't doubt her ability , but really she should be popularising works that have been ignored , not dragging out done-to-death compositions out in banal , supposedly new versions .
maybe she should have a go at ravel 's ondine .
stuart reeves , uk you have to give myleene credit for not going down the road of so many manufactured pop stars ; either into drink and drug overload or trying to relaunch a sagging pop career by reinventing the same old formula in a different frock .
i wo n't say i 'm a fan of this one as it treads too much of the same old ground and could have done with some new tunes -lrb- acoustic alchemy style perhaps ? -rrb- but it 's nice enough to appeal on a broader front than hear 'say .
oh and for me she looks smashing too !
dave , kent , uk leo - never underestimate the power of a weighty cleavage .
stuart g cox , scotland myleene proved that she is a very talented musician .
the selections in the album will be enjoyed by the young and old alike .
an excellent album .
hope she 'll do a lot more to showcase her talent in playing other instrument like the harp and the violin .
charito modina , uk patronising .
anybody whose concentration span is even remotely intact should make the effort , hoist themselves off the couch , and go to a concert hall and see the music of beethoven and elgar played by real musicians .
breaking boundaries ?
no , just getting a huge amount of money to try - it will take more than a lacy number and weighty cleavage to fool me ...
leo , uk moving on is an amazing solo debut album for myleene .
as a hear 'say fan i was n't too sure if i would like it but i ca n't stop listening to it now .
each song is performed brilliantly and myleene shows she is much more than just a pretty face.this album will be suited for people who listen to classical and pop / r 'n'b and they wo n't be let down .

unison has called on the scottish executive to fully fund the new agreement and ensure the increase spreads to other health service workers .
the executive denied there would be a shortfall and insisted it was boosting funding allocations to nhs boards in order to pay for the wage hikes .
jim devine , unison 's scottish organiser for health , said : " while we welcome any group of workers improving their pay and conditions , the 8.5 % pay rise for consultants is having a demoralising impact on the nhs .

it follows the announcement that consultants are to get a pay increase of 8.5 % .
unison has called on the scottish executive to fully fund the new agreement and ensure the increase spreads to other health service workers .
the executive denied there would be a shortfall and insisted it was boosting funding allocations to nhs boards in order to pay for the wage hikes .
jim devine , unison 's scottish organiser for health , said : " while we welcome any group of workers improving their pay and conditions , the 8.5 % pay rise for consultants is having a demoralising impact on the nhs .
as the deal is not being fully funded , a doctor 's pay rise could be a nurse 's unemployment jim devine unison " while the headline figure is an increase of 8.5 % , documents in our possession show that the real rise will be around 15-18 % . "
mr devine warned : " this increase will cost the average scottish trust around £ 750,000 .
" as the deal is not being fully funded , a doctor 's pay rise could be a nurse 's unemployment . "
he claimed trusts may have to reduce staff numbers or services if the executive does not properly fund the agreement .
' fully funded ' mr devine also said the increase was in comparison to a 3.25 % rise granted to nurses , porters , administrative , clerical and laboratory staff this year and a 2.25 % increase for senior managers .
but the executive denied there would be a problem with the funding .
a spokesman said : " not only have the new contracts been agreed for consultants but pay modernisation is being taken forward across the nhs by agenda for change .
" these pay rises are fully funded by the executive through significant increases in nhs board allocations . "
dr peter bennie , a consultant psychiatrist in glasgow and a member of the negotiation team for the bma 's consultants ' committee , defended the rise .
he told bbc scotland : " it is important to remember that this is not a flat pay rise , but the first change in consultants ' contracts since the nhs started in 1948 .
" up until now consultants have all been paid at a flat rate for a 38-and-a-half-hour week , however the vast majority work 50-plus hours .
this brings an end to unpaid overtime .

the last day of datuk seri dr mahathir mohamad 's 22-year term as prime minister marks the end of a remarkable epoch .
he will go down in history as a great leader and go up in the eyes of his people as the greatest malaysian alive ...

on the contrary , he has done a good job in using chinese business skills to further the development of the national economy .
at the same time , he has allowed more flexibility for the chinese in education .
on the whole , mahathir has been a prime minister for all the people , rather than a prime minister just for the malays .
the chinese community should wish mahathir a happy retirement .

comments from western countries seem to be more often negative than positive .

in terms of diplomacy , it can not be denied that mahathir has not been a skilful politician .
his candid and bold image did make him better-known , but it has also brought some economic problems to malaysia .
nanyang siang pau - in chinese in terms of the stable development of our country over the past ten years plus , mahathir 's achievement has indeed been significant .
however , bound by political reality , his rule , though laudable for all his contribution to and accomplishment in our national development , has not been able to transcend party politics and racial interests .

a court decision to order a state kindergarten to remove crucifixes from its classrooms has caused controversy in italy .
the ruling by a judge in the central town of l 'aquila , following a complaint by an italian muslim leader , has re-opened a bitter debate about religious symbols .
the judge ruled that crucifixes on classroom walls showed " the unequivocal desire by the state , when it comes to public education , to place the catholic religion at the centre of the universe " , disregarding other religions .
do you agree with the decision ?
or could it inflame tensions between faiths ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think there should be no crucifixes in the classrooms .
its no problem for me that children learn about the christian religion but if so then why not to learn about all religions .
they should know other point of views to become more tolerant and to retard conflicts .
i grew up in poland with the crucifixes in the classrooms but now i live in germany .
i was told in the school to love all human beings but on the other hand i heard that the other religions are dangerous .
generally each religion can be dangerous .
bozena , germany crosses bearing idols of jesus breach the first commandment as does worship of jesus ' mother and should be banned everywhere .
as a christian i wear an empty cross to remind me there is no death , that i am free and i have promised to treat others as i would like to be treated .
all symbols are personal and should not be backed by government organisations , especially schools .
jesus directed we pray at home , in privacy .
if all followed his advice , there would be no churches with their power to exert power , gather wealth and manipulate gullible and superstitious people .
lionel hurst , australia this is clearly a problem of intolerance of the host country by an outsider , mr smith the muslim leader has also called for the removal of a 15th century christian fresco in bologna cathedral on the grounds that it shows the prophet mohammed this man is absolutely determined to ignore the fact that as a immigrant he should respect the culture and customs of his new adopted land .
yan michek , switzerland the cross simply says , " truth will set you free . "
it is thus the perfect symbol for what we call an education .
it shows us the cosmic relationship between truth and sacrifice .
but it is more that just a symbol .
it is a guide that helps us find meaning in notions like equality , democracy , love and it beckons us to love our neighbours as one .
it is a guide to peace .
who would dare take it down ?
taeho paik , italy " why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion ? "
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- as an italian i 'm very happy about the judge 's decision , it 's about time the crucifixes get removed from state schools , and i know many other italians who think the same .
it 's only unfortunate the case was brought up by a muslim because this gives crucifix supporters an easy excuse to blame " foreigners " for destroying italy 's culture .
this has nothing to do with culture , as a non religious italian i demand crucifixes to be removed from any state building too , they belong in churches !
why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion that is loosing support fast in italy anyway ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- yes !
they should be banned in all ' state ' schools and establishments .
in a ' religious ' school of whatever faith , and where there are clear alternative schools where pupils can be sent , then they should be allowed .
this gives the choice of ' education and indoctrination ' to the parents of the pupils .
' religion ' should also be taken out of any school curricula .
if any parent wants their offspring to be educated in a ' religious ' way then let them go to the nearest appropriate religious establishment , be it a christian on or for any other religion .
b w moore , ne uk i think that everyone is missing the real reason behind the banning of the crucifix .
islam , judaism and christianity -lrb- in its true aramaic form -rrb- strictly forbid the use of idols , pictures etc depicting what prophets looked like .
this is primarily to stop the practice of idol worship which many modern day christians are accustomed to .
the crucifix in the past has been used as a tool by the missionaries to ' tame the savages ' into believing that jesus christ -lrb- peace be upon him -rrb- was a blonde-haired , blue-eyed european rather than a palestinian .
muslims are opposed to the depiction of the prophet jesus in this way .
they are not opposed to the fact that they are being misrepresented in the classroom !
e malik , uk as a roman catholic , i am shocked that one guy can change thousands of years of tradition .
italia is a catholic country and the cross is part of italia 's culture ... if mr. smith does n't like to raise his children in a place where catholics and catholic symbols are predominant , then he needs to pick up and move to saudi arabia or albania ... does it bother mr. smith that his children see the crosses on top of all the great churches of italy ?
should we remove all crosses and church towers around the catholic world , or should we just put a muslim symbol on top of each tower next to the cross to make it to his liking ?
should we not offer pork in our stores , because muslims do n't want to see it ?
marko latinovic , mostar , bosnia-herzegovina " i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ... "
maciek , poland in poland there are at least 95 % classrooms with crosses .
it is really funny and ironic .
people do n't care about them .
they should be removed as should be removed " religion " lesson - and moved to the church !
we 've got to learn about other religions too , how to live and understand others .
i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland italy 's constitution promises freedom of religion , just as most modern western constitutions do .
religious symbols are not appropriate in government schools .
christopher c. tew , usa groups come in and want to take over and change centuries of tradition and culture with one shout of discrimination .
if you choose to go to another country with a different culture and religion , it is the immigrant who has the responsibility for adapting , not the society itself .
gianna , usa i find it extremely depressing to see that , again , the wishes of a few surpass the wishes of the many .
culture and heritage are being erased in order to avoid offending the intolerant .
shannon simons , usa it 's common for christians to feel that this is an act against them , but so would the placing of other religion 's symbols next to their own .
the use of the crucifix to me is seems a bit like idol worship .
my relationship with god is not governed by having pictures laying around , but by the conversations we have .
wwill foster , usa " the only option is to keep the state totally secular " paul qureshi , uk if religious symbols are to be endorsed by the state and placed in classrooms , then all religions must be represented .
this raises two issues .
firstly , what constitutes a religion ?
many people put " jedi " on their census form , would that mean a light-sabre has to be on the wall too ?
secondly , many people would object to , say , satanist symbols , but they too would have to be displayed .
clearly , the only option is to keep the state and all state operated organisations totally secular .
this does not prevent anyone practicing their religion , nor force religion on them .
paul qureshi , uk like the old saying goes , " when in rome , do as the romans do . "
obviously , the muslim leader has never heard this before and does not understand the wisdom behind accepting the cultural aspect of one 's adopted country .
anthony , usa do n't forget that this man went to court when the school refused to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix in his children 's classroom .
so who is being intolerant here ?
if you 're for freedom of religion , let all religions have freedom .
if you 're for secularism , then ban all religious symbols .
people should n't use this issue to unfairly attack muslims yet again when it 's clear that the intolerance stems from others .
bilal patel , london , uk i am not very passionate about religion and this issue .
however , perhaps a better option would be to add some symbols of other religions and so to acknowledge and invite their contribution to national / local culture rather than pretending none of them counts or exists .
dariusz , poland " but i would question why anyone would find this offensive " jim , nj , usa the decision is technically correct because true democracies must be secular .
but i would question why anyone would find this offensive .
christ is n't going to jump off that cross and start converting children of other faiths by force .
the fact that the plaintiff originally wanted another religious symbol added , rather than the removal of the crucifix , proves he was not motivated by democratic ideals .
this is a case of a harmless tradition taken away for childish motives - " if i ca n't have my way , you ca n't have yours either " .
jim , nj , usa yes .
i agree with the ruling .
christians need to realize that they are just one religion with no more authenticity than any other .
tom cunningham , usa if you go to the beach , the wear a swimsuit .
if you 're going to a board meeting , you wear a three-piece suit .
if you going to school , you 're going to study math , literature , biology , and if you want to read the bible , koran , torah or whatever and pray and all that stuff , you go to church , which is where the cross belongs .
it 's very logical , very simple , and the rule of law .
a swimsuit would be out of place in the board room as would a three-piece suit at the beach .
can the cross - it 's out of place , and get over it .
let 's get on with education our young .
bobbi roman , usa what happens to christian residents in muslim countries ?
does any muslim judge dare to ban the half moon or whatever from classrooms in respect of christians ? ? ?
guests must respect the country in which they are hosted , its law and its traditions too .
host countries must surely respect their guests but must respect first their traditions and their native people .
fabio , italy children should not be indoctrinated with religion .
there is enough time when they are adults and more knowledgeable for them to decide if they want to join a religious group .
in the meantime , let us keep any kind of religious symbols out of the classrooms of public schools .
nyakairu , novi , usa like it or not , europe is the main place where christianity grew , in the same way the middle east and asia is where islam grew .
hence a lot of christian symbols here and a lot of islamic symbols in the middle east etc .
some largely muslim countries have crescents on their flags in the same way crosses often appear on european flags .
what we need is mutual respect which means muslims must respect our faith , culture and history in the same way they want us to respect theirs .
the judge 's decision was wrong because it will only cause resentment not respect .
fabian , uk " by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed " jose nigrin , guatemala when any country has a national recognized religion , the result will be the creation of second class citizens , that do n't profess this religion , and suffer discrimination in jobs , education , and opportunities for improvements .
by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed in favour of the main official credo .
jose nigrin , guatemala in public schools absolutely .
in religious ones , no problem .
leduc jean-francois , bangkok thailand what business does a crucifix have in a classroom to begin with ?
if you want to teach your children about a religion , go for it ; however that has nothing to do with public schooling .
if i were a school teacher and decided that i would like to have a statue of ganesh , i think i might get a little flack about it , so why should a crucifix be allowed ?
mike , usa as long as the teacher does not try to convert the children to a particular faith , we should not take away the right to free speech and beliefs .
gareth giles , england i think the cross should have stayed on the wall .
i would suggest , if the man disagrees with the symbol as much as that , then he take his children to a kindergarten that does not outwardly show it 's moral standpoint and not enforce oppression upon the other 99 % of class attendees callum w , uk many contributors are missing the point .
italy is a secular state , therefore the separation of state and religion -lrb- unlike the majority of muslim countries that profess nothing of the sort - the comparative argument thus being moot -rrb- .
the kindergarten being state run had no authority to place a catholic religious symbol in classrooms to the exclusion of all other religions .
the court 's decision was not only fair but based on the rule of law .
people who think otherwise are feeding the debate and controversy regarding islam and the west .
what they should remember is that the crux of all major world religions is tolerance .
h. schmitt , germany not banned nor compulsory .
states should not rule on religion .
people must be free to choose their faith and symbols .
ricardo , brazil " the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions " arif , england as muslim child i went to a church of england primary school , as did all my siblings .
we even went to church on numerous occasions with school !
in no way did this affect my religious identity or my faith .
all my family are devout muslims .
we never had any problems with the symbols of christianity that we visible in school .
the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions .
rather than removing symbols of christianity , symbols of other religions should be allowed in schools , so that we can celebrate or differences in a spirit of understanding , mutual respect and tolerance .
arif , england if the crucifix was on the wall of a catholic or christian school then what is the problem ?
if the muslim leader is in such a school and being in a predominantly christian country surely he must respect the local customs and cultures as he would expect anyone else to if they were in a muslim country , as others have said " when in rome etc . "
vivienne , uk a crucifix is a reminder that jesus the son of god died for our sins .
this is valid for moslems , jews , christians and atheists alike , even though some may not want to accept this truth .
aj , germany why should we remove the symbols of our faiths ?
i follow no religious order but i respect the views of people who do , if we went to muslim countries and started demanding they stop / remove items of their faith , we would be thrown out , this is pc gone mad , next thing on the hit list will be stopping xmas / easter etc .
and people wonder why extreme political parties are gaining ground , why does no one listen ?
j mulligan , uk how are children expected to learn about religion , if we keep banning it ?
surely this teaches intolerance !
susan , uk as dominant as christianity is in italy , the crucifix symbolizes centuries of oppression to those not of the faith .
the current saudi style of religious intolerance is no more extreme , or irrational , than that practiced by vatican inspired governments .
what islamic , jewish , hindi , wiccan , agnostic or atheistic child or adult benefits from the singular presence of a religious symbol in a secular learning environment ?
can the cross ?
amen !
ralph , usa " it should be only displayed in religious schools " manuel , macedonia the crucifix -lrb- which is , either you like it or not , a somewhat morbid symbol with jesus nailed on the cross , bleeding to death -rrb- and portrays the catholic religion with all the respect that it deserves , like any other religion .
therefore it should be only displayed in religious schools .
likewise , islam should abstain to portray religious symbols in non-religious schools .
islam should also refrain from getting into squabbling over religious issues as it will only lead to a growing divide between the west and muslim countries .
it is shameful that both religions fight over spirituality and the same god , despite the way he is perceived and loved by each other .
manuel , macedonia what 's next - banning christmas trees , carol singers and easter eggs ... they are all symbols of christian festivals ...
lisa , italy we think that it could be a good decision , because many and many italian do n't believe in god , especially young people and the school is lay and everyone could believe in what he or she wants .
anyway if someone wants a crucifix in his classroom , he has to allow everyone to put on the walls his own idols .
however we have to identify this case like a case of destroy the catholic religion at the base .
giovanni & riki , italy in our opinion , the cross is a religious symbol so it has n't to be on school 's walls because the school is lay institution .
so putting away from school 's walls the cross is right also because italy is a democratic country and it should n't impose its religion .
we 're christians so we believe in god but we think that the school is n't the place to show our religion because there are others buildings for this -lrb- churches -rrb- !
that 's all !
pamela & roberta , italy " the crucifix is intrinsic to history " anna , usa lately it seems we are bothered when there are mixed displays of sentiment and opinion .
the crucifix is intrinsic to history .
it is a monument of a culture and a movement and though you may not personally prescribe to it , it is still an integral part of the societies of today .
should we forget history because it bothers us ?
anna , usa faith / religion must be placed in the classroom .
it 's ignorant to deny its role in history , politics , culture ... and the day-to-day life of italy .
it 's bigoted to deny any metaphysical dimension to the world .
however , as a christian , i aint impressed with suppression of other religious views .
' elites ' set themselves up as religions ; but goodness knows what mr. keesee is banging on about : the eu ... international socialism . yeah right .
international capitalism more like !
you should pray for socialism if you care for god 's world .
andrew falconer , uk i agree .
religious symbols should be removed from any place of veneration in a secular school system .
larry , usa if italy truly has laws that apply to this situation , then i do n't have a problem with the ruling .
what i find sad though is that all this talk of multi-culturalism is really leading us to no-culturalism .
if everything that any one person disagrees with are banned , it will be a very boring world indeed that we leave to our children .
gary patterson , usa the cross should stay , when in rome do as the roman 's do .
n gorton , uk expat / canada why should n't there be religious symbols in schools ?
religions are part of human history .
religions are the base of the different cultures .
there is a lot of wisdom in all the different religions .
i think teaching about religions should be compulsory .
it is ignorance that creates intolerance , not knowledge .
harriet , singapore / nl " it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around " edwin thornber , uk / romania let muslim countries ban their religious symbols in their own countries before complaining about religious symbols in other countries .
it is surely a bit like complaining that italians speak italian .
it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around .
may be islam should be banned .
edwin thornber , uk / romania since christianity lies at the very foundation of european civilisation , history and law - and most especially italy 's - it is perfectly acceptable to have christian symbols in places where children are educated .
when we abandon the principles of christianity in order to please those of other faiths we tread a dangerous path .
dorothy , belgium i am an italian boy and my point of view is all religious symbols should be kept out from public schools and courts .
all religions must be respect each other , and one day we 'll live in a multi-cultural society .
italo p. , ripatransone italy i find it scary that signs of some religious affiliations are being banned , but others are somehow protected .
why is it ok to wear a headscarf , but not ok to wear a cross ?
why can children in the us swear and threaten their teachers in the name of free speech , but they can not pray in school ?
we have effectively removed god -lrb- by any name or form -rrb- from the public life in the us , now we wonder why our children lack direction and honour ?
sandra , us " separating religion and state should be a must in all countries " stefan , europe separating religion and state should be a must in all countries .
this means removing religious icons from classrooms , courthouses and other public places .
however there should also be freedom of religion .
this means that individuals should be allowed to wear a cross or a headscarf even in school or at work , individuals not government paid institutions should have the choice whether or not to display their religion publicly .
another option would be that public institutions should allow individuals to request their own religious symbol to be added if one of another religion is already present .
this might even help boost the tolerance between religions .
stefan , europe as an atheist i find all religious symbols to be at worst offensive and at best , irrelevant .
i would rather my children not have to observe these blinkered symbols of spiritual oppression , whichever of the main faiths they come from , they have no place in schools although nor does prayer or any other type of faith based activity .
john keegans , nottingham , uk this issue is primarily one of national sovereignty , as far as i am concerned .
there is clearly a general consensus and a deep-rooted tradition among the italians to display the crucifix symbol .
italy is not bound by the formal law in france of 1905 entirely separating religion and state , nor should it be made to bow to the whims of the eurocrats in brussels .
the way things are going , one day the flags of england , the uk , the scandinavian countries , and greece may be forced to remove their cross symbols on the grounds that they portray religious exclusivity .
jacob , uk " those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue " sean , belgium i could not imagine jesus christ or mohammed arguing over these symbols .
all parties involved have missed the point .
those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue .
the right to have the symbol is as strong as the right to remove the symbol .
let the children decide !
sean , belgium is italy not a predominantly catholic country ?
could a christian go to a muslim country and demand that they remove all islamic symbols ?
i think not .
if a muslim wants to reside in a christian country they have to tolerate the religion .
unlike in muslim countries where it is a crime to display crucifixes and possess bibles .
i can not believe the stupidity of the italian judge .
shame on him .
ben aldorino , uk i fail to see how the banning of religious symbols sends a message of multiculturalism and tolerance .
schools should encourage discussion about different religion and cultures because , far from being irrelevant , it seems to be increasingly relevant in the age we are living in .
helen , uk having lived and worked in saudi arabia for 11 years where you ca n't even wear a crucifix on a chain round you neck , take a bible into the kingdom , hold any kind of religious service , or even enter the city of mecca .
where they even stopped swiss air from flying into the kingdom because there plane had a red cross on the tailplane .
all i can say to this muslim leader in italy is " when in rome do as the romans do " and think him self lucky he has some where to go and pray in italy , because in arabia catholics and christians do n't .
r.l.tasker roger tasker , italy why should crosses or any religious symbols be removed ?
if we want a free , tolerant and open minded society , i see no reason why religious symbols should be banned .
i think the decision shows a lack of maturity - just another sign of cultural sanitisation .
js , norwich , uk it is strange that one insists that a cross be removed from a classroom and another is permitted a headscarf in the classroom .
looks like some have their cake and get to eat it .
doug , sweden such traditions are difficult to change , but the value of having a genuinely secular state is now known to be strongly positive .
the change is correct .
cliff , usa " the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision " raimundo l. santos , brazil the crucifix is an important symbol for christians .
as a catholic i do n't see any point in removing our christian symbols for fear any other religion would not like or approve of it .
if i were living in a muslim country for example , i would n't feel scandalized just to see women in their burkas and veils , or men wearing their turbans .
moreover , i suppose " judges " or the like in muslim countries are not really concerned if we christians approve or disapprove of their habits and customs , so why should we ?
the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision , which might as well offend catholics .
raimundo l. santos , brazil if italy 's present laws do , at least on paper , separate the church from the state , then it definitely should have been removed .
i 'm actually surprised this is getting so much attention - while living in italy , going to church in italy , i found most italians did n't regularly attend church .
as for christians in muslim countries , mentioned below - perhaps that 's why these muslims do not live in said countries ?
christina , usa the eu elites see religion as an obstacle not an asset .
the catholic church is a symbol of italy as is the lutheran church in germany and the anglican church in britain and the orthodox churches in eastern europe .
the euro elites want people from sicily to scandinavia to bow to them .
eliminating the religions that are associated with nations and replacing it with their rootless worship of international socialism then the eu elites can further their agenda against national sovereignty .
colin keesee , usa it 's a shame that no mention was made that the muslim man had requested an islamic symbol be represented along side the crucifix .
i 'm not sure i agree with going to court over such an issue when clearly in a country that is predominantly christian .
however , i believe that religious symbols should be removed and teaching kids about different faiths and religions is important to bridge the gap of ignorance between us all .
zak , uk in any country that went through the reformation this would be a non-issue .
but this is italy : the church still plays a massive role in the country 's political life and people 's mind set is not ready yet to deal with a society that only recently has started to become relatively multicultural .
religion should stay out of the classroom .
matteo garavoglia , italy , eu interestingly , many of the non-religious contributors seem to be as , or more , intolerant of religious expression than the religions they view with disdain as intolerant !
mark , scotland " a crucifix in the classroom is the tip of the iceberg in italy " vanessa , uk / italy unfortunately italy has the vatican within its borders , all the political parties try to seek favour with the catholic faith , see the recent debacle on the proposed law for a quick divorce .
i would ban crucifix not only in the schools , but in the courts -lrb- yes , they are present there too -rrb- .
i would ban the religious lessons in schools , taught by teachers that the bishop chooses , not the state education .
a crucifix in the class room is the tip of the iceberg in italy , the church interferes everywhere , unfortunately an , in my view , unpleasant man like smith has started this debate that has been long overdue .
vanessa , uk / italy the crucifix is as much a cultural symbol as a religious one .
it represents centuries of european civilisation and should not be lightly discarded .
richard cotton , london , uk the problem of separation of ' religion in schools ' would go away if the government followed the bastiat principle of limiting the law to its task and letting private institutions educate and provide services .
then the private institutions could be religious or a-religious and it would be fine .
ewan , uk it seems reasonable to remove the crucifix from the classroom if it affects the sentiments of people in the community .
however by taking out a so-called religious symbol , are we not endorsing another symbol ?
let 's just remember that having ' no symbols ' is not fair to all .
it is still subscribing to a particular view .
neil , india in the new europe whose culture is becoming dominated by -lrb- or reduced to -rrb- shopping centres , clearly the elite find the catholic church to be an obstacle to be suppressed .
clearly it is disadvantageous if people have things on their minds other than consumption .
the muslim minority is essentially a tool in the hands of the euro-buros in this case in the suppression of traditions that do not suit their taste .
balazs , italy all this fuss over religion - what about the kids ?
in schools they should be " educated " to be tolerant and loving !
plaster casts on walls or symbols of this or that are irrelevant .
it 's what 's taught them about love and international caring that matters - otherwise shut the schools !
stephen , thailand " religious symbols should never be displayed in schools ... especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others " keith , canada i believed italians were smart and educated - how can they allow such nonsense in a classroom and mislead their children ?
religion should be a personal matter and it should never be symbolised in a place where there are people of mixed or no faith .
amjad farooq , us i do not tend to agree with the judge 's decision .
if the other religion 's leader is not happy with the crucifix because this may influence muslim children in my opinion it would be more prudent if he asked to fix a muslim symbol on the walls near the catholic symbol .
alfred mallia , malta i think the separation of church and state is so heavily enforced in the west that in a way it actually promotes atheism .
i would prefer the way we handle this in bangladesh .
we are a multi-religious country where most of the major religions in the nation are recognised .
if i 'm not mistaken , the muslim leader initially asked for the school to put a muslim symbol beside the cross in the classroom , but the school refused .
i therefore support the judge 's decision to hold every religion with equal respect .
arif joarder , bangladesh " religion should stay out of the classroom , period " kent , canada it 's unfair that the initial suggestion by adel smith to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix should have been denied .
therefore it 's only fair that the crucifix be removed altogether to avoid creating a kind of religious superiority which is totally out of place in a multi-racial society .
patricia , italy it will inflame tensions between faiths , but i think it is a fair ruling as long all faiths are respected rodrigo , paraguay religious symbols have no place in a classroom .
religion is undoubtedly a private matter and should be kept so in the future .
neil jones , united kingdom religion should stay out of the classroom , period .
kent , canada italy was born -lrb- less than 150 years ago -rrb- when the laws of piedmont -lrb- a secular country -rrb- were extended to italy at unification .
italy stayed secular until fascism , when mussolini bought the support of the catholic church by turning back the clock on separation between religion and state .
hence the recent court judgment is in line with italy 's history and gives back to the italians the secular state that is part of their democratic traditions .
silvio sandrone , turin , piedmont -lrb- italy -rrb- muslims want to have religious rights in christian countries , do they grant the same rights to christians in muslim countries ?
adam schott , australia i strongly agree with the judge 's decision .
a fascist state was responsible for the current law .
this issue is a no-brainer and the vatican must be stopped from imposing its agenda on people who do not subscribe to it .
richard , us here in italy , we have one hour a week of confessional catholic teaching in every school .
if you do n't like that you have to opt-out .
in my opinion , that 's the problem , not the crucifix .
paolo , italy religious symbols should never be displayed in schools .
and especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others .
keith , canada " in state schools there is no place for one religion over another " john , france i do n't mind religious symbols in public -lrb- as art -rrb- .
however , as children are so susceptible to the ideas of others above their own , it seems inappropriate for public school to " endorse " any religion .
if children wish to express themselves -lrb- wearing crosses , headscarves -rrb- , this seems innocent .
it is the expression of the child and his or her family , rather than the state communicating a preference to the children .
aleta , united states i ca n't accept that a judge is trying to erase a part of our culture and history with a sentence .
and i ca n't accept that this request comes from a man who believes to be the head of italian muslims and who has always talked so badly of the catholic religion .
and so why do n't we sweep off the red cross symbol ?
michele , italy as a christian i strongly believe that the church and state must be kept separate and state must not and should not support or favour or endorse any one religion as this is a step toward state control of freedom .
crosses i feel are fine in home or in a local church but not in government-run institutions .
mark flanagan , sweden i ca n't help thinking that if it had been the opposite and a catholic had sought the removal of islamic symbols , they would have been slammed for being racist .
once again national culture and history are sacrificed on the altar of political correctness .
dean , uk all religious symbols should -lrb- must -rrb- be removed from public places and public use .
they should be allowed in places of worship of the particular religion / belief or in any individual 's home .
public no , schools no .
miklos nomad , hungary in state schools there is no place for one religion over another and there should be no display of any symbol - crucifix , head scarf or turban .
john , france of course it will inflame tensions between faiths .
italy is , and has within it , the centre of the catholic faith .
to coin a phrase " when in rome ! "
les woods , england / uk religion should be in schools only as part of history or psychology , studied with myths , legends , fairytales and superstitions .
nigel rees , uk / usa it will inflame tensions - europe has been christian for thousands of years and many will see this as foreigners removing our heritage .
tom , england a complete ban on all religious symbols on the walls of schools could be put in place to " show the unequivocal desire by the state ... to place atheism at the centre of the universe " .
whatever is done will be wrong .
as for inflaming tensions between religions , the whole effect of serious and committed religious belief is to preclude tolerance of others .
no religion has ever accepted that others have a right to exist let alone that they might also be correct in their beliefs .
after all their ' holy book ' proves that they are right .

a court decision to order a state kindergarten to remove crucifixes from its classrooms has caused controversy in italy .
the ruling by a judge in the central town of l 'aquila , following a complaint by an italian muslim leader , has re-opened a bitter debate about religious symbols .
the judge ruled that crucifixes on classroom walls showed " the unequivocal desire by the state , when it comes to public education , to place the catholic religion at the centre of the universe " , disregarding other religions .
do you agree with the decision ?
or could it inflame tensions between faiths ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think there should be no crucifixes in the classrooms .
its no problem for me that children learn about the christian religion but if so then why not to learn about all religions .
they should know other point of views to become more tolerant and to retard conflicts .
i grew up in poland with the crucifixes in the classrooms but now i live in germany .
i was told in the school to love all human beings but on the other hand i heard that the other religions are dangerous .
generally each religion can be dangerous .
bozena , germany crosses bearing idols of jesus breach the first commandment as does worship of jesus ' mother and should be banned everywhere .
as a christian i wear an empty cross to remind me there is no death , that i am free and i have promised to treat others as i would like to be treated .
all symbols are personal and should not be backed by government organisations , especially schools .
jesus directed we pray at home , in privacy .
if all followed his advice , there would be no churches with their power to exert power , gather wealth and manipulate gullible and superstitious people .
lionel hurst , australia this is clearly a problem of intolerance of the host country by an outsider , mr smith the muslim leader has also called for the removal of a 15th century christian fresco in bologna cathedral on the grounds that it shows the prophet mohammed this man is absolutely determined to ignore the fact that as a immigrant he should respect the culture and customs of his new adopted land .
yan michek , switzerland the cross simply says , " truth will set you free . "
it is thus the perfect symbol for what we call an education .
it shows us the cosmic relationship between truth and sacrifice .
but it is more that just a symbol .
it is a guide that helps us find meaning in notions like equality , democracy , love and it beckons us to love our neighbours as one .
it is a guide to peace .
who would dare take it down ?
taeho paik , italy why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- as an italian i 'm very happy about the judge 's decision , it 's about time the crucifixes get removed from state schools , and i know many other italians who think the same .
it 's only unfortunate the case was brought up by a muslim because this gives crucifix supporters an easy excuse to blame " foreigners " for destroying italy 's culture .
this has nothing to do with culture , as a non religious italian i demand crucifixes to be removed from any state building too , they belong in churches !
why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion that is loosing support fast in italy anyway ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- yes !
they should be banned in all ' state ' schools and establishments .
in a ' religious ' school of whatever faith , and where there are clear alternative schools where pupils can be sent , then they should be allowed .
this gives the choice of ' education and indoctrination ' to the parents of the pupils .
' religion ' should also be taken out of any school curricula .
if any parent wants their offspring to be educated in a ' religious ' way then let them go to the nearest appropriate religious establishment , be it a christian on or for any other religion .
b w moore , ne uk i think that everyone is missing the real reason behind the banning of the crucifix .
islam , judaism and christianity -lrb- in its true aramaic form -rrb- strictly forbid the use of idols , pictures etc depicting what prophets looked like .
this is primarily to stop the practice of idol worship which many modern day christians are accustomed to .
the crucifix in the past has been used as a tool by the missionaries to ' tame the savages ' into believing that jesus christ -lrb- peace be upon him -rrb- was a blonde-haired , blue-eyed european rather than a palestinian .
muslims are opposed to the depiction of the prophet jesus in this way .
they are not opposed to the fact that they are being misrepresented in the classroom !
e malik , uk as a roman catholic , i am shocked that one guy can change thousands of years of tradition .
italia is a catholic country and the cross is part of italia 's culture ... if mr. smith does n't like to raise his children in a place where catholics and catholic symbols are predominant , then he needs to pick up and move to saudi arabia or albania ... does it bother mr. smith that his children see the crosses on top of all the great churches of italy ?
should we remove all crosses and church towers around the catholic world , or should we just put a muslim symbol on top of each tower next to the cross to make it to his liking ?
should we not offer pork in our stores , because muslims do n't want to see it ?
marko latinovic , mostar , bosnia-herzegovina i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland in poland there are at least 95 % classrooms with crosses .
it is really funny and ironic .
people do n't care about them .
they should be removed as should be removed " religion " lesson - and moved to the church !
we 've got to learn about other religions too , how to live and understand others .
i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland italy 's constitution promises freedom of religion , just as most modern western constitutions do .
religious symbols are not appropriate in government schools .
christopher c. tew , usa groups come in and want to take over and change centuries of tradition and culture with one shout of discrimination .
if you choose to go to another country with a different culture and religion , it is the immigrant who has the responsibility for adapting , not the society itself .
gianna , usa i find it extremely depressing to see that , again , the wishes of a few surpass the wishes of the many .
culture and heritage are being erased in order to avoid offending the intolerant .
shannon simons , usa it 's common for christians to feel that this is an act against them , but so would the placing of other religion 's symbols next to their own .
the use of the crucifix to me is seems a bit like idol worship .
my relationship with god is not governed by having pictures laying around , but by the conversations we have .
wwill foster , usa the only option is to keep the state totally secular paul qureshi , uk if religious symbols are to be endorsed by the state and placed in classrooms , then all religions must be represented .
this raises two issues .
firstly , what constitutes a religion ?
many people put " jedi " on their census form , would that mean a light-sabre has to be on the wall too ?
secondly , many people would object to , say , satanist symbols , but they too would have to be displayed .
clearly , the only option is to keep the state and all state operated organisations totally secular .
this does not prevent anyone practicing their religion , nor force religion on them .
paul qureshi , uk like the old saying goes , " when in rome , do as the romans do . "
obviously , the muslim leader has never heard this before and does not understand the wisdom behind accepting the cultural aspect of one 's adopted country .
anthony , usa do n't forget that this man went to court when the school refused to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix in his children 's classroom .
so who is being intolerant here ?
if you 're for freedom of religion , let all religions have freedom .
if you 're for secularism , then ban all religious symbols .
people should n't use this issue to unfairly attack muslims yet again when it 's clear that the intolerance stems from others .
bilal patel , london , uk i am not very passionate about religion and this issue .
however , perhaps a better option would be to add some symbols of other religions and so to acknowledge and invite their contribution to national / local culture rather than pretending none of them counts or exists .
dariusz , poland but i would question why anyone would find this offensive jim , nj , usa the decision is technically correct because true democracies must be secular .
but i would question why anyone would find this offensive .
christ is n't going to jump off that cross and start converting children of other faiths by force .
the fact that the plaintiff originally wanted another religious symbol added , rather than the removal of the crucifix , proves he was not motivated by democratic ideals .
this is a case of a harmless tradition taken away for childish motives - " if i ca n't have my way , you ca n't have yours either " .
jim , nj , usa yes .
i agree with the ruling .
christians need to realize that they are just one religion with no more authenticity than any other .
tom cunningham , usa if you go to the beach , the wear a swimsuit .
if you 're going to a board meeting , you wear a three-piece suit .
if you going to school , you 're going to study math , literature , biology , and if you want to read the bible , koran , torah or whatever and pray and all that stuff , you go to church , which is where the cross belongs .
it 's very logical , very simple , and the rule of law .
a swimsuit would be out of place in the board room as would a three-piece suit at the beach .
can the cross - it 's out of place , and get over it .
let 's get on with education our young .
bobbi roman , usa what happens to christian residents in muslim countries ?
does any muslim judge dare to ban the half moon or whatever from classrooms in respect of christians ? ? ?
guests must respect the country in which they are hosted , its law and its traditions too .
host countries must surely respect their guests but must respect first their traditions and their native people .
fabio , italy children should not be indoctrinated with religion .
there is enough time when they are adults and more knowledgeable for them to decide if they want to join a religious group .
in the meantime , let us keep any kind of religious symbols out of the classrooms of public schools .
nyakairu , novi , usa like it or not , europe is the main place where christianity grew , in the same way the middle east and asia is where islam grew .
hence a lot of christian symbols here and a lot of islamic symbols in the middle east etc .
some largely muslim countries have crescents on their flags in the same way crosses often appear on european flags .
what we need is mutual respect which means muslims must respect our faith , culture and history in the same way they want us to respect theirs .
the judge 's decision was wrong because it will only cause resentment not respect .
fabian , uk by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed jose nigrin , guatemala when any country has a national recognized religion , the result will be the creation of second class citizens , that do n't profess this religion , and suffer discrimination in jobs , education , and opportunities for improvements .
by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed in favour of the main official credo .
jose nigrin , guatemala in public schools absolutely .
in religious ones , no problem .
leduc jean-francois , bangkok thailand what business does a crucifix have in a classroom to begin with ?
if you want to teach your children about a religion , go for it ; however that has nothing to do with public schooling .
if i were a school teacher and decided that i would like to have a statue of ganesh , i think i might get a little flack about it , so why should a crucifix be allowed ?
mike , usa as long as the teacher does not try to convert the children to a particular faith , we should not take away the right to free speech and beliefs .
gareth giles , england i think the cross should have stayed on the wall .
i would suggest , if the man disagrees with the symbol as much as that , then he take his children to a kindergarten that does not outwardly show it 's moral standpoint and not enforce oppression upon the other 99 % of class attendees callum w , uk many contributors are missing the point .
italy is a secular state , therefore the separation of state and religion -lrb- unlike the majority of muslim countries that profess nothing of the sort - the comparative argument thus being moot -rrb- .
the kindergarten being state run had no authority to place a catholic religious symbol in classrooms to the exclusion of all other religions .
the court 's decision was not only fair but based on the rule of law .
people who think otherwise are feeding the debate and controversy regarding islam and the west .
what they should remember is that the crux of all major world religions is tolerance .
h. schmitt , germany not banned nor compulsory .
states should not rule on religion .
people must be free to choose their faith and symbols .
ricardo , brazil the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions arif , england as muslim child i went to a church of england primary school , as did all my siblings .
we even went to church on numerous occasions with school !
in no way did this affect my religious identity or my faith .
all my family are devout muslims .
we never had any problems with the symbols of christianity that we visible in school .
the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions .
rather than removing symbols of christianity , symbols of other religions should be allowed in schools , so that we can celebrate or differences in a spirit of understanding , mutual respect and tolerance .
arif , england if the crucifix was on the wall of a catholic or christian school then what is the problem ?
if the muslim leader is in such a school and being in a predominantly christian country surely he must respect the local customs and cultures as he would expect anyone else to if they were in a muslim country , as others have said " when in rome etc . "
vivienne , uk a crucifix is a reminder that jesus the son of god died for our sins .
this is valid for moslems , jews , christians and atheists alike , even though some may not want to accept this truth .
aj , germany why should we remove the symbols of our faiths ?
i follow no religious order but i respect the views of people who do , if we went to muslim countries and started demanding they stop / remove items of their faith , we would be thrown out , this is pc gone mad , next thing on the hit list will be stopping xmas / easter etc .
and people wonder why extreme political parties are gaining ground , why does no one listen ?
j mulligan , uk how are children expected to learn about religion , if we keep banning it ?
surely this teaches intolerance !
susan , uk as dominant as christianity is in italy , the crucifix symbolizes centuries of oppression to those not of the faith .
the current saudi style of religious intolerance is no more extreme , or irrational , than that practiced by vatican inspired governments .
what islamic , jewish , hindi , wiccan , agnostic or atheistic child or adult benefits from the singular presence of a religious symbol in a secular learning environment ?
can the cross ?
amen !
ralph , usa it should be only displayed in religious schools manuel , macedonia the crucifix -lrb- which is , either you like it or not , a somewhat morbid symbol with jesus nailed on the cross , bleeding to death -rrb- and portrays the catholic religion with all the respect that it deserves , like any other religion .
therefore it should be only displayed in religious schools .
likewise , islam should abstain to portray religious symbols in non-religious schools .
islam should also refrain from getting into squabbling over religious issues as it will only lead to a growing divide between the west and muslim countries .
it is shameful that both religions fight over spirituality and the same god , despite the way he is perceived and loved by each other .
manuel , macedonia what 's next - banning christmas trees , carol singers and easter eggs ... they are all symbols of christian festivals ...
lisa , italy we think that it could be a good decision , because many and many italian do n't believe in god , especially young people and the school is lay and everyone could believe in what he or she wants .
anyway if someone wants a crucifix in his classroom , he has to allow everyone to put on the walls his own idols .
however we have to identify this case like a case of destroy the catholic religion at the base .
giovanni & riki , italy in our opinion , the cross is a religious symbol so it has n't to be on school 's walls because the school is lay institution .
so putting away from school 's walls the cross is right also because italy is a democratic country and it should n't impose its religion .
we 're christians so we believe in god but we think that the school is n't the place to show our religion because there are others buildings for this -lrb- churches -rrb- !
that 's all !
pamela & roberta , italy the crucifix is intrinsic to history anna , usa lately it seems we are bothered when there are mixed displays of sentiment and opinion .
the crucifix is intrinsic to history .
it is a monument of a culture and a movement and though you may not personally prescribe to it , it is still an integral part of the societies of today .
should we forget history because it bothers us ?
anna , usa faith / religion must be placed in the classroom .
it 's ignorant to deny its role in history , politics , culture ... and the day-to-day life of italy .
it 's bigoted to deny any metaphysical dimension to the world .
however , as a christian , i aint impressed with suppression of other religious views .
' elites ' set themselves up as religions ; but goodness knows what mr. keesee is banging on about : the eu ... international socialism . yeah right .
international capitalism more like !
you should pray for socialism if you care for god 's world .
andrew falconer , uk i agree .
religious symbols should be removed from any place of veneration in a secular school system .
larry , usa if italy truly has laws that apply to this situation , then i do n't have a problem with the ruling .
what i find sad though is that all this talk of multi-culturalism is really leading us to no-culturalism .
if everything that any one person disagrees with are banned , it will be a very boring world indeed that we leave to our children .
gary patterson , usa the cross should stay , when in rome do as the roman 's do .
n gorton , uk expat / canada why should n't there be religious symbols in schools ?
religions are part of human history .
religions are the base of the different cultures .
there is a lot of wisdom in all the different religions .
i think teaching about religions should be compulsory .
it is ignorance that creates intolerance , not knowledge .
harriet , singapore / nl it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around edwin thornber , uk / romania let muslim countries ban their religious symbols in their own countries before complaining about religious symbols in other countries .
it is surely a bit like complaining that italians speak italian .
it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around .
may be islam should be banned .
edwin thornber , uk / romania since christianity lies at the very foundation of european civilisation , history and law - and most especially italy 's - it is perfectly acceptable to have christian symbols in places where children are educated .
when we abandon the principles of christianity in order to please those of other faiths we tread a dangerous path .
dorothy , belgium i am an italian boy and my point of view is all religious symbols should be kept out from public schools and courts .
all religions must be respect each other , and one day we 'll live in a multi-cultural society .
italo p. , ripatransone italy i find it scary that signs of some religious affiliations are being banned , but others are somehow protected .
why is it ok to wear a headscarf , but not ok to wear a cross ?
why can children in the us swear and threaten their teachers in the name of free speech , but they can not pray in school ?
we have effectively removed god -lrb- by any name or form -rrb- from the public life in the us , now we wonder why our children lack direction and honour ?
sandra , us separating religion and state should be a must in all countries stefan , europe separating religion and state should be a must in all countries .
this means removing religious icons from classrooms , courthouses and other public places .
however there should also be freedom of religion .
this means that individuals should be allowed to wear a cross or a headscarf even in school or at work , individuals not government paid institutions should have the choice whether or not to display their religion publicly .
another option would be that public institutions should allow individuals to request their own religious symbol to be added if one of another religion is already present .
this might even help boost the tolerance between religions .
stefan , europe as an atheist i find all religious symbols to be at worst offensive and at best , irrelevant .
i would rather my children not have to observe these blinkered symbols of spiritual oppression , whichever of the main faiths they come from , they have no place in schools although nor does prayer or any other type of faith based activity .
john keegans , nottingham , uk this issue is primarily one of national sovereignty , as far as i am concerned .
there is clearly a general consensus and a deep-rooted tradition among the italians to display the crucifix symbol .
italy is not bound by the formal law in france of 1905 entirely separating religion and state , nor should it be made to bow to the whims of the eurocrats in brussels .
the way things are going , one day the flags of england , the uk , the scandinavian countries , and greece may be forced to remove their cross symbols on the grounds that they portray religious exclusivity .
jacob , uk those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue sean , belgium i could not imagine jesus christ or mohammed arguing over these symbols .
all parties involved have missed the point .
those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue .
the right to have the symbol is as strong as the right to remove the symbol .
let the children decide !
sean , belgium is italy not a predominantly catholic country ?
could a christian go to a muslim country and demand that they remove all islamic symbols ?
i think not .
if a muslim wants to reside in a christian country they have to tolerate the religion .
unlike in muslim countries where it is a crime to display crucifixes and possess bibles .
i can not believe the stupidity of the italian judge .
shame on him .
ben aldorino , uk i fail to see how the banning of religious symbols sends a message of multiculturalism and tolerance .
schools should encourage discussion about different religion and cultures because , far from being irrelevant , it seems to be increasingly relevant in the age we are living in .
helen , uk having lived and worked in saudi arabia for 11 years where you ca n't even wear a crucifix on a chain round you neck , take a bible into the kingdom , hold any kind of religious service , or even enter the city of mecca .
where they even stopped swiss air from flying into the kingdom because there plane had a red cross on the tailplane .
all i can say to this muslim leader in italy is " when in rome do as the romans do " and think him self lucky he has some where to go and pray in italy , because in arabia catholics and christians do n't .
r.l.tasker roger tasker , italy why should crosses or any religious symbols be removed ?
if we want a free , tolerant and open minded society , i see no reason why religious symbols should be banned .
i think the decision shows a lack of maturity - just another sign of cultural sanitisation .
js , norwich , uk it is strange that one insists that a cross be removed from a classroom and another is permitted a headscarf in the classroom .
looks like some have their cake and get to eat it .
doug , sweden such traditions are difficult to change , but the value of having a genuinely secular state is now known to be strongly positive .
the change is correct .
cliff , usa the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision raimundo l. santos , brazil the crucifix is an important symbol for christians .
as a catholic i do n't see any point in removing our christian symbols for fear any other religion would not like or approve of it .
if i were living in a muslim country for example , i would n't feel scandalized just to see women in their burkas and veils , or men wearing their turbans .
moreover , i suppose " judges " or the like in muslim countries are not really concerned if we christians approve or disapprove of their habits and customs , so why should we ?
the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision , which might as well offend catholics .
raimundo l. santos , brazil if italy 's present laws do , at least on paper , separate the church from the state , then it definitely should have been removed .
i 'm actually surprised this is getting so much attention - while living in italy , going to church in italy , i found most italians did n't regularly attend church .
as for christians in muslim countries , mentioned below - perhaps that 's why these muslims do not live in said countries ?
christina , usa the eu elites see religion as an obstacle not an asset .
the catholic church is a symbol of italy as is the lutheran church in germany and the anglican church in britain and the orthodox churches in eastern europe .
the euro elites want people from sicily to scandinavia to bow to them .
eliminating the religions that are associated with nations and replacing it with their rootless worship of international socialism then the eu elites can further their agenda against national sovereignty .
colin keesee , usa it 's a shame that no mention was made that the muslim man had requested an islamic symbol be represented along side the crucifix .
i 'm not sure i agree with going to court over such an issue when clearly in a country that is predominantly christian .
however , i believe that religious symbols should be removed and teaching kids about different faiths and religions is important to bridge the gap of ignorance between us all .
zak , uk in any country that went through the reformation this would be a non-issue .
but this is italy : the church still plays a massive role in the country 's political life and people 's mind set is not ready yet to deal with a society that only recently has started to become relatively multicultural .
religion should stay out of the classroom .
matteo garavoglia , italy , eu interestingly , many of the non-religious contributors seem to be as , or more , intolerant of religious expression than the religions they view with disdain as intolerant !
mark , scotland a crucifix in the classroom is the tip of the iceberg in italy vanessa , uk / italy unfortunately italy has the vatican within its borders , all the political parties try to seek favour with the catholic faith , see the recent debacle on the proposed law for a quick divorce .
i would ban crucifix not only in the schools , but in the courts -lrb- yes , they are present there too -rrb- .
i would ban the religious lessons in schools , taught by teachers that the bishop chooses , not the state education .
a crucifix in the class room is the tip of the iceberg in italy , the church interferes everywhere , unfortunately an , in my view , unpleasant man like smith has started this debate that has been long overdue .
vanessa , uk / italy the crucifix is as much a cultural symbol as a religious one .
it represents centuries of european civilisation and should not be lightly discarded .
richard cotton , london , uk the problem of separation of ' religion in schools ' would go away if the government followed the bastiat principle of limiting the law to its task and letting private institutions educate and provide services .
then the private institutions could be religious or a-religious and it would be fine .
ewan , uk it seems reasonable to remove the crucifix from the classroom if it affects the sentiments of people in the community .
however by taking out a so-called religious symbol , are we not endorsing another symbol ?
let 's just remember that having ' no symbols ' is not fair to all .
it is still subscribing to a particular view .
neil , india in the new europe whose culture is becoming dominated by -lrb- or reduced to -rrb- shopping centres , clearly the elite find the catholic church to be an obstacle to be suppressed .
clearly it is disadvantageous if people have things on their minds other than consumption .
the muslim minority is essentially a tool in the hands of the euro-buros in this case in the suppression of traditions that do not suit their taste .
balazs , italy all this fuss over religion - what about the kids ?
in schools they should be " educated " to be tolerant and loving !
plaster casts on walls or symbols of this or that are irrelevant .
it 's what 's taught them about love and international caring that matters - otherwise shut the schools !
stephen , thailand religious symbols should never be displayed in schools ... especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others keith , canada i believed italians were smart and educated - how can they allow such nonsense in a classroom and mislead their children ?
religion should be a personal matter and it should never be symbolised in a place where there are people of mixed or no faith .
amjad farooq , us i do not tend to agree with the judge 's decision .
if the other religion 's leader is not happy with the crucifix because this may influence muslim children in my opinion it would be more prudent if he asked to fix a muslim symbol on the walls near the catholic symbol .
alfred mallia , malta i think the separation of church and state is so heavily enforced in the west that in a way it actually promotes atheism .
i would prefer the way we handle this in bangladesh .
we are a multi-religious country where most of the major religions in the nation are recognised .
if i 'm not mistaken , the muslim leader initially asked for the school to put a muslim symbol beside the cross in the classroom , but the school refused .
i therefore support the judge 's decision to hold every religion with equal respect .
arif joarder , bangladesh religion should stay out of the classroom , period kent , canada it 's unfair that the initial suggestion by adel smith to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix should have been denied .
therefore it 's only fair that the crucifix be removed altogether to avoid creating a kind of religious superiority which is totally out of place in a multi-racial society .
patricia , italy it will inflame tensions between faiths , but i think it is a fair ruling as long all faiths are respected rodrigo , paraguay religious symbols have no place in a classroom .
religion is undoubtedly a private matter and should be kept so in the future .
neil jones , united kingdom religion should stay out of the classroom , period .
kent , canada italy was born -lrb- less than 150 years ago -rrb- when the laws of piedmont -lrb- a secular country -rrb- were extended to italy at unification .
italy stayed secular until fascism , when mussolini bought the support of the catholic church by turning back the clock on separation between religion and state .
hence the recent court judgment is in line with italy 's history and gives back to the italians the secular state that is part of their democratic traditions .
silvio sandrone , turin , piedmont -lrb- italy -rrb- muslims want to have religious rights in christian countries , do they grant the same rights to christians in muslim countries ?
adam schott , australia i strongly agree with the judge 's decision .
a fascist state was responsible for the current law .
this issue is a no-brainer and the vatican must be stopped from imposing its agenda on people who do not subscribe to it .
richard , us here in italy , we have one hour a week of confessional catholic teaching in every school .
if you do n't like that you have to opt-out .
in my opinion , that 's the problem , not the crucifix .
paolo , italy religious symbols should never be displayed in schools .
and especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others .
keith , canada in state schools there is no place for one religion over another john , france i do n't mind religious symbols in public -lrb- as art -rrb- .
however , as children are so susceptible to the ideas of others above their own , it seems inappropriate for public school to " endorse " any religion .
if children wish to express themselves -lrb- wearing crosses , headscarves -rrb- , this seems innocent .
it is the expression of the child and his or her family , rather than the state communicating a preference to the children .
aleta , united states i ca n't accept that a judge is trying to erase a part of our culture and history with a sentence .
and i ca n't accept that this request comes from a man who believes to be the head of italian muslims and who has always talked so badly of the catholic religion .
and so why do n't we sweep off the red cross symbol ?
michele , italy as a christian i strongly believe that the church and state must be kept separate and state must not and should not support or favour or endorse any one religion as this is a step toward state control of freedom .
crosses i feel are fine in home or in a local church but not in government-run institutions .
mark flanagan , sweden i ca n't help thinking that if it had been the opposite and a catholic had sought the removal of islamic symbols , they would have been slammed for being racist .
once again national culture and history are sacrificed on the altar of political correctness .
dean , uk all religious symbols should -lrb- must -rrb- be removed from public places and public use .
they should be allowed in places of worship of the particular religion / belief or in any individual 's home .
public no , schools no .
miklos nomad , hungary in state schools there is no place for one religion over another and there should be no display of any symbol - crucifix , head scarf or turban .
john , france of course it will inflame tensions between faiths .
italy is , and has within it , the centre of the catholic faith .
to coin a phrase " when in rome ! "
les woods , england / uk religion should be in schools only as part of history or psychology , studied with myths , legends , fairytales and superstitions .
nigel rees , uk / usa it will inflame tensions - europe has been christian for thousands of years and many will see this as foreigners removing our heritage .
tom , england a complete ban on all religious symbols on the walls of schools could be put in place to " show the unequivocal desire by the state ... to place atheism at the centre of the universe " .
whatever is done will be wrong .
as for inflaming tensions between religions , the whole effect of serious and committed religious belief is to preclude tolerance of others .
no religion has ever accepted that others have a right to exist let alone that they might also be correct in their beliefs .
after all their ' holy book ' proves that they are right .

a court decision to order a state kindergarten to remove crucifixes from its classrooms has caused controversy in italy .
the ruling by a judge in the central town of l 'aquila , following a complaint by an italian muslim leader , has re-opened a bitter debate about religious symbols .
the judge ruled that crucifixes on classroom walls showed " the unequivocal desire by the state , when it comes to public education , to place the catholic religion at the centre of the universe " , disregarding other religions .
do you agree with the decision ?
or could it inflame tensions between faiths ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think there should be no crucifixes in the classrooms .
its no problem for me that children learn about the christian religion but if so then why not to learn about all religions .
they should know other point of views to become more tolerant and to retard conflicts .
i grew up in poland with the crucifixes in the classrooms but now i live in germany .
i was told in the school to love all human beings but on the other hand i heard that the other religions are dangerous .
generally each religion can be dangerous .
bozena , germany crosses bearing idols of jesus breach the first commandment as does worship of jesus ' mother and should be banned everywhere .
as a christian i wear an empty cross to remind me there is no death , that i am free and i have promised to treat others as i would like to be treated .
all symbols are personal and should not be backed by government organisations , especially schools .
jesus directed we pray at home , in privacy .
if all followed his advice , there would be no churches with their power to exert power , gather wealth and manipulate gullible and superstitious people .
lionel hurst , australia this is clearly a problem of intolerance of the host country by an outsider , mr smith the muslim leader has also called for the removal of a 15th century christian fresco in bologna cathedral on the grounds that it shows the prophet mohammed this man is absolutely determined to ignore the fact that as a immigrant he should respect the culture and customs of his new adopted land .
yan michek , switzerland the cross simply says , " truth will set you free . "
it is thus the perfect symbol for what we call an education .
it shows us the cosmic relationship between truth and sacrifice .
but it is more that just a symbol .
it is a guide that helps us find meaning in notions like equality , democracy , love and it beckons us to love our neighbours as one .
it is a guide to peace .
who would dare take it down ?
taeho paik , italy why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- as an italian i 'm very happy about the judge 's decision , it 's about time the crucifixes get removed from state schools , and i know many other italians who think the same .
it 's only unfortunate the case was brought up by a muslim because this gives crucifix supporters an easy excuse to blame " foreigners " for destroying italy 's culture .
this has nothing to do with culture , as a non religious italian i demand crucifixes to be removed from any state building too , they belong in churches !
why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion that is loosing support fast in italy anyway ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- yes !
they should be banned in all ' state ' schools and establishments .
in a ' religious ' school of whatever faith , and where there are clear alternative schools where pupils can be sent , then they should be allowed .
this gives the choice of ' education and indoctrination ' to the parents of the pupils .
' religion ' should also be taken out of any school curricula .
if any parent wants their offspring to be educated in a ' religious ' way then let them go to the nearest appropriate religious establishment , be it a christian on or for any other religion .
b w moore , ne uk i think that everyone is missing the real reason behind the banning of the crucifix .
islam , judaism and christianity -lrb- in its true aramaic form -rrb- strictly forbid the use of idols , pictures etc depicting what prophets looked like .
this is primarily to stop the practice of idol worship which many modern day christians are accustomed to .
the crucifix in the past has been used as a tool by the missionaries to ' tame the savages ' into believing that jesus christ -lrb- peace be upon him -rrb- was a blonde-haired , blue-eyed european rather than a palestinian .
muslims are opposed to the depiction of the prophet jesus in this way .
they are not opposed to the fact that they are being misrepresented in the classroom !
e malik , uk as a roman catholic , i am shocked that one guy can change thousands of years of tradition .
italia is a catholic country and the cross is part of italia 's culture ... if mr. smith does n't like to raise his children in a place where catholics and catholic symbols are predominant , then he needs to pick up and move to saudi arabia or albania ... does it bother mr. smith that his children see the crosses on top of all the great churches of italy ?
should we remove all crosses and church towers around the catholic world , or should we just put a muslim symbol on top of each tower next to the cross to make it to his liking ?
should we not offer pork in our stores , because muslims do n't want to see it ?
marko latinovic , mostar , bosnia-herzegovina i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland in poland there are at least 95 % classrooms with crosses .
it is really funny and ironic .
people do n't care about them .
they should be removed as should be removed " religion " lesson - and moved to the church !
we 've got to learn about other religions too , how to live and understand others .
i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland italy 's constitution promises freedom of religion , just as most modern western constitutions do .
religious symbols are not appropriate in government schools .
christopher c. tew , usa groups come in and want to take over and change centuries of tradition and culture with one shout of discrimination .
if you choose to go to another country with a different culture and religion , it is the immigrant who has the responsibility for adapting , not the society itself .
gianna , usa i find it extremely depressing to see that , again , the wishes of a few surpass the wishes of the many .
culture and heritage are being erased in order to avoid offending the intolerant .
shannon simons , usa it 's common for christians to feel that this is an act against them , but so would the placing of other religion 's symbols next to their own .
the use of the crucifix to me is seems a bit like idol worship .
my relationship with god is not governed by having pictures laying around , but by the conversations we have .
wwill foster , usa the only option is to keep the state totally secular paul qureshi , uk if religious symbols are to be endorsed by the state and placed in classrooms , then all religions must be represented .
this raises two issues .
firstly , what constitutes a religion ?
many people put " jedi " on their census form , would that mean a light-sabre has to be on the wall too ?
secondly , many people would object to , say , satanist symbols , but they too would have to be displayed .
clearly , the only option is to keep the state and all state operated organisations totally secular .
this does not prevent anyone practicing their religion , nor force religion on them .
paul qureshi , uk like the old saying goes , " when in rome , do as the romans do . "
obviously , the muslim leader has never heard this before and does not understand the wisdom behind accepting the cultural aspect of one 's adopted country .
anthony , usa do n't forget that this man went to court when the school refused to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix in his children 's classroom .
so who is being intolerant here ?
if you 're for freedom of religion , let all religions have freedom .
if you 're for secularism , then ban all religious symbols .
people should n't use this issue to unfairly attack muslims yet again when it 's clear that the intolerance stems from others .
bilal patel , london , uk i am not very passionate about religion and this issue .
however , perhaps a better option would be to add some symbols of other religions and so to acknowledge and invite their contribution to national / local culture rather than pretending none of them counts or exists .
dariusz , poland but i would question why anyone would find this offensive jim , nj , usa the decision is technically correct because true democracies must be secular .
but i would question why anyone would find this offensive .
christ is n't going to jump off that cross and start converting children of other faiths by force .
the fact that the plaintiff originally wanted another religious symbol added , rather than the removal of the crucifix , proves he was not motivated by democratic ideals .
this is a case of a harmless tradition taken away for childish motives - " if i ca n't have my way , you ca n't have yours either " .
jim , nj , usa yes .
i agree with the ruling .
christians need to realize that they are just one religion with no more authenticity than any other .
tom cunningham , usa if you go to the beach , the wear a swimsuit .
if you 're going to a board meeting , you wear a three-piece suit .
if you going to school , you 're going to study math , literature , biology , and if you want to read the bible , koran , torah or whatever and pray and all that stuff , you go to church , which is where the cross belongs .
it 's very logical , very simple , and the rule of law .
a swimsuit would be out of place in the board room as would a three-piece suit at the beach .
can the cross - it 's out of place , and get over it .
let 's get on with education our young .
bobbi roman , usa what happens to christian residents in muslim countries ?
does any muslim judge dare to ban the half moon or whatever from classrooms in respect of christians ? ? ?
guests must respect the country in which they are hosted , its law and its traditions too .
host countries must surely respect their guests but must respect first their traditions and their native people .
fabio , italy children should not be indoctrinated with religion .
there is enough time when they are adults and more knowledgeable for them to decide if they want to join a religious group .
in the meantime , let us keep any kind of religious symbols out of the classrooms of public schools .
nyakairu , novi , usa like it or not , europe is the main place where christianity grew , in the same way the middle east and asia is where islam grew .
hence a lot of christian symbols here and a lot of islamic symbols in the middle east etc .
some largely muslim countries have crescents on their flags in the same way crosses often appear on european flags .
what we need is mutual respect which means muslims must respect our faith , culture and history in the same way they want us to respect theirs .
the judge 's decision was wrong because it will only cause resentment not respect .
fabian , uk by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed jose nigrin , guatemala when any country has a national recognized religion , the result will be the creation of second class citizens , that do n't profess this religion , and suffer discrimination in jobs , education , and opportunities for improvements .
by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed in favour of the main official credo .
jose nigrin , guatemala in public schools absolutely .
in religious ones , no problem .
leduc jean-francois , bangkok thailand what business does a crucifix have in a classroom to begin with ?
if you want to teach your children about a religion , go for it ; however that has nothing to do with public schooling .
if i were a school teacher and decided that i would like to have a statue of ganesh , i think i might get a little flack about it , so why should a crucifix be allowed ?
mike , usa as long as the teacher does not try to convert the children to a particular faith , we should not take away the right to free speech and beliefs .
gareth giles , england i think the cross should have stayed on the wall .
i would suggest , if the man disagrees with the symbol as much as that , then he take his children to a kindergarten that does not outwardly show it 's moral standpoint and not enforce oppression upon the other 99 % of class attendees callum w , uk many contributors are missing the point .
italy is a secular state , therefore the separation of state and religion -lrb- unlike the majority of muslim countries that profess nothing of the sort - the comparative argument thus being moot -rrb- .
the kindergarten being state run had no authority to place a catholic religious symbol in classrooms to the exclusion of all other religions .
the court 's decision was not only fair but based on the rule of law .
people who think otherwise are feeding the debate and controversy regarding islam and the west .
what they should remember is that the crux of all major world religions is tolerance .
h. schmitt , germany not banned nor compulsory .
states should not rule on religion .
people must be free to choose their faith and symbols .
ricardo , brazil the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions arif , england as muslim child i went to a church of england primary school , as did all my siblings .
we even went to church on numerous occasions with school !
in no way did this affect my religious identity or my faith .
all my family are devout muslims .
we never had any problems with the symbols of christianity that we visible in school .
the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions .
rather than removing symbols of christianity , symbols of other religions should be allowed in schools , so that we can celebrate or differences in a spirit of understanding , mutual respect and tolerance .
arif , england if the crucifix was on the wall of a catholic or christian school then what is the problem ?
if the muslim leader is in such a school and being in a predominantly christian country surely he must respect the local customs and cultures as he would expect anyone else to if they were in a muslim country , as others have said " when in rome etc . "
vivienne , uk a crucifix is a reminder that jesus the son of god died for our sins .
this is valid for moslems , jews , christians and atheists alike , even though some may not want to accept this truth .
aj , germany why should we remove the symbols of our faiths ?
i follow no religious order but i respect the views of people who do , if we went to muslim countries and started demanding they stop / remove items of their faith , we would be thrown out , this is pc gone mad , next thing on the hit list will be stopping xmas / easter etc .
and people wonder why extreme political parties are gaining ground , why does no one listen ?
j mulligan , uk how are children expected to learn about religion , if we keep banning it ?
surely this teaches intolerance !
susan , uk as dominant as christianity is in italy , the crucifix symbolizes centuries of oppression to those not of the faith .
the current saudi style of religious intolerance is no more extreme , or irrational , than that practiced by vatican inspired governments .
what islamic , jewish , hindi , wiccan , agnostic or atheistic child or adult benefits from the singular presence of a religious symbol in a secular learning environment ?
can the cross ?
amen !
ralph , usa it should be only displayed in religious schools manuel , macedonia the crucifix -lrb- which is , either you like it or not , a somewhat morbid symbol with jesus nailed on the cross , bleeding to death -rrb- and portrays the catholic religion with all the respect that it deserves , like any other religion .
therefore it should be only displayed in religious schools .
likewise , islam should abstain to portray religious symbols in non-religious schools .
islam should also refrain from getting into squabbling over religious issues as it will only lead to a growing divide between the west and muslim countries .
it is shameful that both religions fight over spirituality and the same god , despite the way he is perceived and loved by each other .
manuel , macedonia what 's next - banning christmas trees , carol singers and easter eggs ... they are all symbols of christian festivals ...
lisa , italy we think that it could be a good decision , because many and many italian do n't believe in god , especially young people and the school is lay and everyone could believe in what he or she wants .
anyway if someone wants a crucifix in his classroom , he has to allow everyone to put on the walls his own idols .
however we have to identify this case like a case of destroy the catholic religion at the base .
giovanni & riki , italy in our opinion , the cross is a religious symbol so it has n't to be on school 's walls because the school is lay institution .
so putting away from school 's walls the cross is right also because italy is a democratic country and it should n't impose its religion .
we 're christians so we believe in god but we think that the school is n't the place to show our religion because there are others buildings for this -lrb- churches -rrb- !
that 's all !
pamela & roberta , italy the crucifix is intrinsic to history anna , usa lately it seems we are bothered when there are mixed displays of sentiment and opinion .
the crucifix is intrinsic to history .
it is a monument of a culture and a movement and though you may not personally prescribe to it , it is still an integral part of the societies of today .
should we forget history because it bothers us ?
anna , usa faith / religion must be placed in the classroom .
it 's ignorant to deny its role in history , politics , culture ... and the day-to-day life of italy .
it 's bigoted to deny any metaphysical dimension to the world .
however , as a christian , i aint impressed with suppression of other religious views .
' elites ' set themselves up as religions ; but goodness knows what mr. keesee is banging on about : the eu ... international socialism . yeah right .
international capitalism more like !
you should pray for socialism if you care for god 's world .
andrew falconer , uk i agree .
religious symbols should be removed from any place of veneration in a secular school system .
larry , usa if italy truly has laws that apply to this situation , then i do n't have a problem with the ruling .
what i find sad though is that all this talk of multi-culturalism is really leading us to no-culturalism .
if everything that any one person disagrees with are banned , it will be a very boring world indeed that we leave to our children .
gary patterson , usa the cross should stay , when in rome do as the roman 's do .
n gorton , uk expat / canada why should n't there be religious symbols in schools ?
religions are part of human history .
religions are the base of the different cultures .
there is a lot of wisdom in all the different religions .
i think teaching about religions should be compulsory .
it is ignorance that creates intolerance , not knowledge .
harriet , singapore / nl it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around edwin thornber , uk / romania let muslim countries ban their religious symbols in their own countries before complaining about religious symbols in other countries .
it is surely a bit like complaining that italians speak italian .
it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around .
may be islam should be banned .
edwin thornber , uk / romania since christianity lies at the very foundation of european civilisation , history and law - and most especially italy 's - it is perfectly acceptable to have christian symbols in places where children are educated .
when we abandon the principles of christianity in order to please those of other faiths we tread a dangerous path .
dorothy , belgium i am an italian boy and my point of view is all religious symbols should be kept out from public schools and courts .
all religions must be respect each other , and one day we 'll live in a multi-cultural society .
italo p. , ripatransone italy i find it scary that signs of some religious affiliations are being banned , but others are somehow protected .
why is it ok to wear a headscarf , but not ok to wear a cross ?
why can children in the us swear and threaten their teachers in the name of free speech , but they can not pray in school ?
we have effectively removed god -lrb- by any name or form -rrb- from the public life in the us , now we wonder why our children lack direction and honour ?
sandra , us separating religion and state should be a must in all countries stefan , europe separating religion and state should be a must in all countries .
this means removing religious icons from classrooms , courthouses and other public places .
however there should also be freedom of religion .
this means that individuals should be allowed to wear a cross or a headscarf even in school or at work , individuals not government paid institutions should have the choice whether or not to display their religion publicly .
another option would be that public institutions should allow individuals to request their own religious symbol to be added if one of another religion is already present .
this might even help boost the tolerance between religions .
stefan , europe as an atheist i find all religious symbols to be at worst offensive and at best , irrelevant .
i would rather my children not have to observe these blinkered symbols of spiritual oppression , whichever of the main faiths they come from , they have no place in schools although nor does prayer or any other type of faith based activity .
john keegans , nottingham , uk this issue is primarily one of national sovereignty , as far as i am concerned .
there is clearly a general consensus and a deep-rooted tradition among the italians to display the crucifix symbol .
italy is not bound by the formal law in france of 1905 entirely separating religion and state , nor should it be made to bow to the whims of the eurocrats in brussels .
the way things are going , one day the flags of england , the uk , the scandinavian countries , and greece may be forced to remove their cross symbols on the grounds that they portray religious exclusivity .
jacob , uk those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue sean , belgium i could not imagine jesus christ or mohammed arguing over these symbols .
all parties involved have missed the point .
those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue .
the right to have the symbol is as strong as the right to remove the symbol .
let the children decide !
sean , belgium is italy not a predominantly catholic country ?
could a christian go to a muslim country and demand that they remove all islamic symbols ?
i think not .
if a muslim wants to reside in a christian country they have to tolerate the religion .
unlike in muslim countries where it is a crime to display crucifixes and possess bibles .
i can not believe the stupidity of the italian judge .
shame on him .
ben aldorino , uk i fail to see how the banning of religious symbols sends a message of multiculturalism and tolerance .
schools should encourage discussion about different religion and cultures because , far from being irrelevant , it seems to be increasingly relevant in the age we are living in .
helen , uk having lived and worked in saudi arabia for 11 years where you ca n't even wear a crucifix on a chain round you neck , take a bible into the kingdom , hold any kind of religious service , or even enter the city of mecca .
where they even stopped swiss air from flying into the kingdom because there plane had a red cross on the tailplane .
all i can say to this muslim leader in italy is " when in rome do as the romans do " and think him self lucky he has some where to go and pray in italy , because in arabia catholics and christians do n't .
r.l.tasker roger tasker , italy why should crosses or any religious symbols be removed ?
if we want a free , tolerant and open minded society , i see no reason why religious symbols should be banned .
i think the decision shows a lack of maturity - just another sign of cultural sanitisation .
js , norwich , uk it is strange that one insists that a cross be removed from a classroom and another is permitted a headscarf in the classroom .
looks like some have their cake and get to eat it .
doug , sweden such traditions are difficult to change , but the value of having a genuinely secular state is now known to be strongly positive .
the change is correct .
cliff , usa the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision raimundo l. santos , brazil the crucifix is an important symbol for christians .
as a catholic i do n't see any point in removing our christian symbols for fear any other religion would not like or approve of it .
if i were living in a muslim country for example , i would n't feel scandalized just to see women in their burkas and veils , or men wearing their turbans .
moreover , i suppose " judges " or the like in muslim countries are not really concerned if we christians approve or disapprove of their habits and customs , so why should we ?
the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision , which might as well offend catholics .
raimundo l. santos , brazil if italy 's present laws do , at least on paper , separate the church from the state , then it definitely should have been removed .
i 'm actually surprised this is getting so much attention - while living in italy , going to church in italy , i found most italians did n't regularly attend church .
as for christians in muslim countries , mentioned below - perhaps that 's why these muslims do not live in said countries ?
christina , usa the eu elites see religion as an obstacle not an asset .
the catholic church is a symbol of italy as is the lutheran church in germany and the anglican church in britain and the orthodox churches in eastern europe .
the euro elites want people from sicily to scandinavia to bow to them .
eliminating the religions that are associated with nations and replacing it with their rootless worship of international socialism then the eu elites can further their agenda against national sovereignty .
colin keesee , usa it 's a shame that no mention was made that the muslim man had requested an islamic symbol be represented along side the crucifix .
i 'm not sure i agree with going to court over such an issue when clearly in a country that is predominantly christian .
however , i believe that religious symbols should be removed and teaching kids about different faiths and religions is important to bridge the gap of ignorance between us all .
zak , uk in any country that went through the reformation this would be a non-issue .
but this is italy : the church still plays a massive role in the country 's political life and people 's mind set is not ready yet to deal with a society that only recently has started to become relatively multicultural .
religion should stay out of the classroom .
matteo garavoglia , italy , eu interestingly , many of the non-religious contributors seem to be as , or more , intolerant of religious expression than the religions they view with disdain as intolerant !
mark , scotland a crucifix in the classroom is the tip of the iceberg in italy vanessa , uk / italy unfortunately italy has the vatican within its borders , all the political parties try to seek favour with the catholic faith , see the recent debacle on the proposed law for a quick divorce .
i would ban crucifix not only in the schools , but in the courts -lrb- yes , they are present there too -rrb- .
i would ban the religious lessons in schools , taught by teachers that the bishop chooses , not the state education .
a crucifix in the class room is the tip of the iceberg in italy , the church interferes everywhere , unfortunately an , in my view , unpleasant man like smith has started this debate that has been long overdue .
vanessa , uk / italy the crucifix is as much a cultural symbol as a religious one .
it represents centuries of european civilisation and should not be lightly discarded .
richard cotton , london , uk the problem of separation of ' religion in schools ' would go away if the government followed the bastiat principle of limiting the law to its task and letting private institutions educate and provide services .
then the private institutions could be religious or a-religious and it would be fine .
ewan , uk it seems reasonable to remove the crucifix from the classroom if it affects the sentiments of people in the community .
however by taking out a so-called religious symbol , are we not endorsing another symbol ?
let 's just remember that having ' no symbols ' is not fair to all .
it is still subscribing to a particular view .
neil , india in the new europe whose culture is becoming dominated by -lrb- or reduced to -rrb- shopping centres , clearly the elite find the catholic church to be an obstacle to be suppressed .
clearly it is disadvantageous if people have things on their minds other than consumption .
the muslim minority is essentially a tool in the hands of the euro-buros in this case in the suppression of traditions that do not suit their taste .
balazs , italy all this fuss over religion - what about the kids ?
in schools they should be " educated " to be tolerant and loving !
plaster casts on walls or symbols of this or that are irrelevant .
it 's what 's taught them about love and international caring that matters - otherwise shut the schools !
stephen , thailand religious symbols should never be displayed in schools ... especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others keith , canada i believed italians were smart and educated - how can they allow such nonsense in a classroom and mislead their children ?
religion should be a personal matter and it should never be symbolised in a place where there are people of mixed or no faith .
amjad farooq , us i do not tend to agree with the judge 's decision .
if the other religion 's leader is not happy with the crucifix because this may influence muslim children in my opinion it would be more prudent if he asked to fix a muslim symbol on the walls near the catholic symbol .
alfred mallia , malta i think the separation of church and state is so heavily enforced in the west that in a way it actually promotes atheism .
i would prefer the way we handle this in bangladesh .
we are a multi-religious country where most of the major religions in the nation are recognised .
if i 'm not mistaken , the muslim leader initially asked for the school to put a muslim symbol beside the cross in the classroom , but the school refused .
i therefore support the judge 's decision to hold every religion with equal respect .
arif joarder , bangladesh religion should stay out of the classroom , period kent , canada it 's unfair that the initial suggestion by adel smith to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix should have been denied .
therefore it 's only fair that the crucifix be removed altogether to avoid creating a kind of religious superiority which is totally out of place in a multi-racial society .
patricia , italy it will inflame tensions between faiths , but i think it is a fair ruling as long all faiths are respected rodrigo , paraguay religious symbols have no place in a classroom .
religion is undoubtedly a private matter and should be kept so in the future .
neil jones , united kingdom religion should stay out of the classroom , period .
kent , canada italy was born -lrb- less than 150 years ago -rrb- when the laws of piedmont -lrb- a secular country -rrb- were extended to italy at unification .
italy stayed secular until fascism , when mussolini bought the support of the catholic church by turning back the clock on separation between religion and state .
hence the recent court judgment is in line with italy 's history and gives back to the italians the secular state that is part of their democratic traditions .
silvio sandrone , turin , piedmont -lrb- italy -rrb- muslims want to have religious rights in christian countries , do they grant the same rights to christians in muslim countries ?
adam schott , australia i strongly agree with the judge 's decision .
a fascist state was responsible for the current law .
this issue is a no-brainer and the vatican must be stopped from imposing its agenda on people who do not subscribe to it .
richard , us here in italy , we have one hour a week of confessional catholic teaching in every school .
if you do n't like that you have to opt-out .
in my opinion , that 's the problem , not the crucifix .
paolo , italy religious symbols should never be displayed in schools .
and especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others .
keith , canada in state schools there is no place for one religion over another john , france i do n't mind religious symbols in public -lrb- as art -rrb- .
however , as children are so susceptible to the ideas of others above their own , it seems inappropriate for public school to " endorse " any religion .
if children wish to express themselves -lrb- wearing crosses , headscarves -rrb- , this seems innocent .
it is the expression of the child and his or her family , rather than the state communicating a preference to the children .
aleta , united states i ca n't accept that a judge is trying to erase a part of our culture and history with a sentence .
and i ca n't accept that this request comes from a man who believes to be the head of italian muslims and who has always talked so badly of the catholic religion .
and so why do n't we sweep off the red cross symbol ?
michele , italy as a christian i strongly believe that the church and state must be kept separate and state must not and should not support or favour or endorse any one religion as this is a step toward state control of freedom .
crosses i feel are fine in home or in a local church but not in government-run institutions .
mark flanagan , sweden i ca n't help thinking that if it had been the opposite and a catholic had sought the removal of islamic symbols , they would have been slammed for being racist .
once again national culture and history are sacrificed on the altar of political correctness .
dean , uk all religious symbols should -lrb- must -rrb- be removed from public places and public use .
they should be allowed in places of worship of the particular religion / belief or in any individual 's home .
public no , schools no .
miklos nomad , hungary in state schools there is no place for one religion over another and there should be no display of any symbol - crucifix , head scarf or turban .
john , france of course it will inflame tensions between faiths .
italy is , and has within it , the centre of the catholic faith .
to coin a phrase " when in rome ! "
les woods , england / uk religion should be in schools only as part of history or psychology , studied with myths , legends , fairytales and superstitions .
nigel rees , uk / usa it will inflame tensions - europe has been christian for thousands of years and many will see this as foreigners removing our heritage .
tom , england a complete ban on all religious symbols on the walls of schools could be put in place to " show the unequivocal desire by the state ... to place atheism at the centre of the universe " .
whatever is done will be wrong .
as for inflaming tensions between religions , the whole effect of serious and committed religious belief is to preclude tolerance of others .
no religion has ever accepted that others have a right to exist let alone that they might also be correct in their beliefs .
after all their ' holy book ' proves that they are right .

a court decision to order a state kindergarten to remove crucifixes from its classrooms has caused controversy in italy .
the ruling by a judge in the central town of l 'aquila , following a complaint by an italian muslim leader , has re-opened a bitter debate about religious symbols .
the judge ruled that crucifixes on classroom walls showed " the unequivocal desire by the state , when it comes to public education , to place the catholic religion at the centre of the universe " , disregarding other religions .
do you agree with the decision ?
or could it inflame tensions between faiths ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think there should be no crucifixes in the classrooms .
its no problem for me that children learn about the christian religion but if so then why not to learn about all religions .
they should know other point of views to become more tolerant and to retard conflicts .
i grew up in poland with the crucifixes in the classrooms but now i live in germany .
i was told in the school to love all human beings but on the other hand i heard that the other religions are dangerous .
generally each religion can be dangerous .
bozena , germany crosses bearing idols of jesus breach the first commandment as does worship of jesus ' mother and should be banned everywhere .
as a christian i wear an empty cross to remind me there is no death , that i am free and i have promised to treat others as i would like to be treated .
all symbols are personal and should not be backed by government organisations , especially schools .
jesus directed we pray at home , in privacy .
if all followed his advice , there would be no churches with their power to exert power , gather wealth and manipulate gullible and superstitious people .
lionel hurst , australia this is clearly a problem of intolerance of the host country by an outsider , mr smith the muslim leader has also called for the removal of a 15th century christian fresco in bologna cathedral on the grounds that it shows the prophet mohammed this man is absolutely determined to ignore the fact that as a immigrant he should respect the culture and customs of his new adopted land .
yan michek , switzerland the cross simply says , " truth will set you free . "
it is thus the perfect symbol for what we call an education .
it shows us the cosmic relationship between truth and sacrifice .
but it is more that just a symbol .
it is a guide that helps us find meaning in notions like equality , democracy , love and it beckons us to love our neighbours as one .
it is a guide to peace .
who would dare take it down ?
taeho paik , italy why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- as an italian i 'm very happy about the judge 's decision , it 's about time the crucifixes get removed from state schools , and i know many other italians who think the same .
it 's only unfortunate the case was brought up by a muslim because this gives crucifix supporters an easy excuse to blame " foreigners " for destroying italy 's culture .
this has nothing to do with culture , as a non religious italian i demand crucifixes to be removed from any state building too , they belong in churches !
why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion that is loosing support fast in italy anyway ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- yes !
they should be banned in all ' state ' schools and establishments .
in a ' religious ' school of whatever faith , and where there are clear alternative schools where pupils can be sent , then they should be allowed .
this gives the choice of ' education and indoctrination ' to the parents of the pupils .
' religion ' should also be taken out of any school curricula .
if any parent wants their offspring to be educated in a ' religious ' way then let them go to the nearest appropriate religious establishment , be it a christian on or for any other religion .
b w moore , ne uk i think that everyone is missing the real reason behind the banning of the crucifix .
islam , judaism and christianity -lrb- in its true aramaic form -rrb- strictly forbid the use of idols , pictures etc depicting what prophets looked like .
this is primarily to stop the practice of idol worship which many modern day christians are accustomed to .
the crucifix in the past has been used as a tool by the missionaries to ' tame the savages ' into believing that jesus christ -lrb- peace be upon him -rrb- was a blonde-haired , blue-eyed european rather than a palestinian .
muslims are opposed to the depiction of the prophet jesus in this way .
they are not opposed to the fact that they are being misrepresented in the classroom !
e malik , uk as a roman catholic , i am shocked that one guy can change thousands of years of tradition .
italia is a catholic country and the cross is part of italia 's culture ... if mr. smith does n't like to raise his children in a place where catholics and catholic symbols are predominant , then he needs to pick up and move to saudi arabia or albania ... does it bother mr. smith that his children see the crosses on top of all the great churches of italy ?
should we remove all crosses and church towers around the catholic world , or should we just put a muslim symbol on top of each tower next to the cross to make it to his liking ?
should we not offer pork in our stores , because muslims do n't want to see it ?
marko latinovic , mostar , bosnia-herzegovina i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland in poland there are at least 95 % classrooms with crosses .
it is really funny and ironic .
people do n't care about them .
they should be removed as should be removed " religion " lesson - and moved to the church !
we 've got to learn about other religions too , how to live and understand others .
i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland italy 's constitution promises freedom of religion , just as most modern western constitutions do .
religious symbols are not appropriate in government schools .
christopher c. tew , usa groups come in and want to take over and change centuries of tradition and culture with one shout of discrimination .
if you choose to go to another country with a different culture and religion , it is the immigrant who has the responsibility for adapting , not the society itself .
gianna , usa i find it extremely depressing to see that , again , the wishes of a few surpass the wishes of the many .
culture and heritage are being erased in order to avoid offending the intolerant .
shannon simons , usa it 's common for christians to feel that this is an act against them , but so would the placing of other religion 's symbols next to their own .
the use of the crucifix to me is seems a bit like idol worship .
my relationship with god is not governed by having pictures laying around , but by the conversations we have .
wwill foster , usa the only option is to keep the state totally secular paul qureshi , uk if religious symbols are to be endorsed by the state and placed in classrooms , then all religions must be represented .
this raises two issues .
firstly , what constitutes a religion ?
many people put " jedi " on their census form , would that mean a light-sabre has to be on the wall too ?
secondly , many people would object to , say , satanist symbols , but they too would have to be displayed .
clearly , the only option is to keep the state and all state operated organisations totally secular .
this does not prevent anyone practicing their religion , nor force religion on them .
paul qureshi , uk like the old saying goes , " when in rome , do as the romans do . "
obviously , the muslim leader has never heard this before and does not understand the wisdom behind accepting the cultural aspect of one 's adopted country .
anthony , usa do n't forget that this man went to court when the school refused to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix in his children 's classroom .
so who is being intolerant here ?
if you 're for freedom of religion , let all religions have freedom .
if you 're for secularism , then ban all religious symbols .
people should n't use this issue to unfairly attack muslims yet again when it 's clear that the intolerance stems from others .
bilal patel , london , uk i am not very passionate about religion and this issue .
however , perhaps a better option would be to add some symbols of other religions and so to acknowledge and invite their contribution to national / local culture rather than pretending none of them counts or exists .
dariusz , poland but i would question why anyone would find this offensive jim , nj , usa the decision is technically correct because true democracies must be secular .
but i would question why anyone would find this offensive .
christ is n't going to jump off that cross and start converting children of other faiths by force .
the fact that the plaintiff originally wanted another religious symbol added , rather than the removal of the crucifix , proves he was not motivated by democratic ideals .
this is a case of a harmless tradition taken away for childish motives - " if i ca n't have my way , you ca n't have yours either " .
jim , nj , usa yes .
i agree with the ruling .
christians need to realize that they are just one religion with no more authenticity than any other .
tom cunningham , usa if you go to the beach , the wear a swimsuit .
if you 're going to a board meeting , you wear a three-piece suit .
if you going to school , you 're going to study math , literature , biology , and if you want to read the bible , koran , torah or whatever and pray and all that stuff , you go to church , which is where the cross belongs .
it 's very logical , very simple , and the rule of law .
a swimsuit would be out of place in the board room as would a three-piece suit at the beach .
can the cross - it 's out of place , and get over it .
let 's get on with education our young .
bobbi roman , usa what happens to christian residents in muslim countries ?
does any muslim judge dare to ban the half moon or whatever from classrooms in respect of christians ? ? ?
guests must respect the country in which they are hosted , its law and its traditions too .
host countries must surely respect their guests but must respect first their traditions and their native people .
fabio , italy children should not be indoctrinated with religion .
there is enough time when they are adults and more knowledgeable for them to decide if they want to join a religious group .
in the meantime , let us keep any kind of religious symbols out of the classrooms of public schools .
nyakairu , novi , usa like it or not , europe is the main place where christianity grew , in the same way the middle east and asia is where islam grew .
hence a lot of christian symbols here and a lot of islamic symbols in the middle east etc .
some largely muslim countries have crescents on their flags in the same way crosses often appear on european flags .
what we need is mutual respect which means muslims must respect our faith , culture and history in the same way they want us to respect theirs .
the judge 's decision was wrong because it will only cause resentment not respect .
fabian , uk by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed jose nigrin , guatemala when any country has a national recognized religion , the result will be the creation of second class citizens , that do n't profess this religion , and suffer discrimination in jobs , education , and opportunities for improvements .
by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed in favour of the main official credo .
jose nigrin , guatemala in public schools absolutely .
in religious ones , no problem .
leduc jean-francois , bangkok thailand what business does a crucifix have in a classroom to begin with ?
if you want to teach your children about a religion , go for it ; however that has nothing to do with public schooling .
if i were a school teacher and decided that i would like to have a statue of ganesh , i think i might get a little flack about it , so why should a crucifix be allowed ?
mike , usa as long as the teacher does not try to convert the children to a particular faith , we should not take away the right to free speech and beliefs .
gareth giles , england i think the cross should have stayed on the wall .
i would suggest , if the man disagrees with the symbol as much as that , then he take his children to a kindergarten that does not outwardly show it 's moral standpoint and not enforce oppression upon the other 99 % of class attendees callum w , uk many contributors are missing the point .
italy is a secular state , therefore the separation of state and religion -lrb- unlike the majority of muslim countries that profess nothing of the sort - the comparative argument thus being moot -rrb- .
the kindergarten being state run had no authority to place a catholic religious symbol in classrooms to the exclusion of all other religions .
the court 's decision was not only fair but based on the rule of law .
people who think otherwise are feeding the debate and controversy regarding islam and the west .
what they should remember is that the crux of all major world religions is tolerance .
h. schmitt , germany not banned nor compulsory .
states should not rule on religion .
people must be free to choose their faith and symbols .
ricardo , brazil the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions arif , england as muslim child i went to a church of england primary school , as did all my siblings .
we even went to church on numerous occasions with school !
in no way did this affect my religious identity or my faith .
all my family are devout muslims .
we never had any problems with the symbols of christianity that we visible in school .
the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions .
rather than removing symbols of christianity , symbols of other religions should be allowed in schools , so that we can celebrate or differences in a spirit of understanding , mutual respect and tolerance .
arif , england if the crucifix was on the wall of a catholic or christian school then what is the problem ?
if the muslim leader is in such a school and being in a predominantly christian country surely he must respect the local customs and cultures as he would expect anyone else to if they were in a muslim country , as others have said " when in rome etc . "
vivienne , uk a crucifix is a reminder that jesus the son of god died for our sins .
this is valid for moslems , jews , christians and atheists alike , even though some may not want to accept this truth .
aj , germany why should we remove the symbols of our faiths ?
i follow no religious order but i respect the views of people who do , if we went to muslim countries and started demanding they stop / remove items of their faith , we would be thrown out , this is pc gone mad , next thing on the hit list will be stopping xmas / easter etc .
and people wonder why extreme political parties are gaining ground , why does no one listen ?
j mulligan , uk how are children expected to learn about religion , if we keep banning it ?
surely this teaches intolerance !
susan , uk as dominant as christianity is in italy , the crucifix symbolizes centuries of oppression to those not of the faith .
the current saudi style of religious intolerance is no more extreme , or irrational , than that practiced by vatican inspired governments .
what islamic , jewish , hindi , wiccan , agnostic or atheistic child or adult benefits from the singular presence of a religious symbol in a secular learning environment ?
can the cross ?
amen !
ralph , usa it should be only displayed in religious schools manuel , macedonia the crucifix -lrb- which is , either you like it or not , a somewhat morbid symbol with jesus nailed on the cross , bleeding to death -rrb- and portrays the catholic religion with all the respect that it deserves , like any other religion .
therefore it should be only displayed in religious schools .
likewise , islam should abstain to portray religious symbols in non-religious schools .
islam should also refrain from getting into squabbling over religious issues as it will only lead to a growing divide between the west and muslim countries .
it is shameful that both religions fight over spirituality and the same god , despite the way he is perceived and loved by each other .
manuel , macedonia what 's next - banning christmas trees , carol singers and easter eggs ... they are all symbols of christian festivals ...
lisa , italy we think that it could be a good decision , because many and many italian do n't believe in god , especially young people and the school is lay and everyone could believe in what he or she wants .
anyway if someone wants a crucifix in his classroom , he has to allow everyone to put on the walls his own idols .
however we have to identify this case like a case of destroy the catholic religion at the base .
giovanni & riki , italy in our opinion , the cross is a religious symbol so it has n't to be on school 's walls because the school is lay institution .
so putting away from school 's walls the cross is right also because italy is a democratic country and it should n't impose its religion .
we 're christians so we believe in god but we think that the school is n't the place to show our religion because there are others buildings for this -lrb- churches -rrb- !
that 's all !
pamela & roberta , italy the crucifix is intrinsic to history anna , usa lately it seems we are bothered when there are mixed displays of sentiment and opinion .
the crucifix is intrinsic to history .
it is a monument of a culture and a movement and though you may not personally prescribe to it , it is still an integral part of the societies of today .
should we forget history because it bothers us ?
anna , usa faith / religion must be placed in the classroom .
it 's ignorant to deny its role in history , politics , culture ... and the day-to-day life of italy .
it 's bigoted to deny any metaphysical dimension to the world .
however , as a christian , i aint impressed with suppression of other religious views .
' elites ' set themselves up as religions ; but goodness knows what mr. keesee is banging on about : the eu ... international socialism . yeah right .
international capitalism more like !
you should pray for socialism if you care for god 's world .
andrew falconer , uk i agree .
religious symbols should be removed from any place of veneration in a secular school system .
larry , usa if italy truly has laws that apply to this situation , then i do n't have a problem with the ruling .
what i find sad though is that all this talk of multi-culturalism is really leading us to no-culturalism .
if everything that any one person disagrees with are banned , it will be a very boring world indeed that we leave to our children .
gary patterson , usa the cross should stay , when in rome do as the roman 's do .
n gorton , uk expat / canada why should n't there be religious symbols in schools ?
religions are part of human history .
religions are the base of the different cultures .
there is a lot of wisdom in all the different religions .
i think teaching about religions should be compulsory .
it is ignorance that creates intolerance , not knowledge .
harriet , singapore / nl it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around edwin thornber , uk / romania let muslim countries ban their religious symbols in their own countries before complaining about religious symbols in other countries .
it is surely a bit like complaining that italians speak italian .
it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around .
may be islam should be banned .
edwin thornber , uk / romania since christianity lies at the very foundation of european civilisation , history and law - and most especially italy 's - it is perfectly acceptable to have christian symbols in places where children are educated .
when we abandon the principles of christianity in order to please those of other faiths we tread a dangerous path .
dorothy , belgium i am an italian boy and my point of view is all religious symbols should be kept out from public schools and courts .
all religions must be respect each other , and one day we 'll live in a multi-cultural society .
italo p. , ripatransone italy i find it scary that signs of some religious affiliations are being banned , but others are somehow protected .
why is it ok to wear a headscarf , but not ok to wear a cross ?
why can children in the us swear and threaten their teachers in the name of free speech , but they can not pray in school ?
we have effectively removed god -lrb- by any name or form -rrb- from the public life in the us , now we wonder why our children lack direction and honour ?
sandra , us separating religion and state should be a must in all countries stefan , europe separating religion and state should be a must in all countries .
this means removing religious icons from classrooms , courthouses and other public places .
however there should also be freedom of religion .
this means that individuals should be allowed to wear a cross or a headscarf even in school or at work , individuals not government paid institutions should have the choice whether or not to display their religion publicly .
another option would be that public institutions should allow individuals to request their own religious symbol to be added if one of another religion is already present .
this might even help boost the tolerance between religions .
stefan , europe as an atheist i find all religious symbols to be at worst offensive and at best , irrelevant .
i would rather my children not have to observe these blinkered symbols of spiritual oppression , whichever of the main faiths they come from , they have no place in schools although nor does prayer or any other type of faith based activity .
john keegans , nottingham , uk this issue is primarily one of national sovereignty , as far as i am concerned .
there is clearly a general consensus and a deep-rooted tradition among the italians to display the crucifix symbol .
italy is not bound by the formal law in france of 1905 entirely separating religion and state , nor should it be made to bow to the whims of the eurocrats in brussels .
the way things are going , one day the flags of england , the uk , the scandinavian countries , and greece may be forced to remove their cross symbols on the grounds that they portray religious exclusivity .
jacob , uk those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue sean , belgium i could not imagine jesus christ or mohammed arguing over these symbols .
all parties involved have missed the point .
those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue .
the right to have the symbol is as strong as the right to remove the symbol .
let the children decide !
sean , belgium is italy not a predominantly catholic country ?
could a christian go to a muslim country and demand that they remove all islamic symbols ?
i think not .
if a muslim wants to reside in a christian country they have to tolerate the religion .
unlike in muslim countries where it is a crime to display crucifixes and possess bibles .
i can not believe the stupidity of the italian judge .
shame on him .
ben aldorino , uk i fail to see how the banning of religious symbols sends a message of multiculturalism and tolerance .
schools should encourage discussion about different religion and cultures because , far from being irrelevant , it seems to be increasingly relevant in the age we are living in .
helen , uk having lived and worked in saudi arabia for 11 years where you ca n't even wear a crucifix on a chain round you neck , take a bible into the kingdom , hold any kind of religious service , or even enter the city of mecca .
where they even stopped swiss air from flying into the kingdom because there plane had a red cross on the tailplane .
all i can say to this muslim leader in italy is " when in rome do as the romans do " and think him self lucky he has some where to go and pray in italy , because in arabia catholics and christians do n't .
r.l.tasker roger tasker , italy why should crosses or any religious symbols be removed ?
if we want a free , tolerant and open minded society , i see no reason why religious symbols should be banned .
i think the decision shows a lack of maturity - just another sign of cultural sanitisation .
js , norwich , uk it is strange that one insists that a cross be removed from a classroom and another is permitted a headscarf in the classroom .
looks like some have their cake and get to eat it .
doug , sweden such traditions are difficult to change , but the value of having a genuinely secular state is now known to be strongly positive .
the change is correct .
cliff , usa the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision raimundo l. santos , brazil the crucifix is an important symbol for christians .
as a catholic i do n't see any point in removing our christian symbols for fear any other religion would not like or approve of it .
if i were living in a muslim country for example , i would n't feel scandalized just to see women in their burkas and veils , or men wearing their turbans .
moreover , i suppose " judges " or the like in muslim countries are not really concerned if we christians approve or disapprove of their habits and customs , so why should we ?
the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision , which might as well offend catholics .
raimundo l. santos , brazil if italy 's present laws do , at least on paper , separate the church from the state , then it definitely should have been removed .
i 'm actually surprised this is getting so much attention - while living in italy , going to church in italy , i found most italians did n't regularly attend church .
as for christians in muslim countries , mentioned below - perhaps that 's why these muslims do not live in said countries ?
christina , usa the eu elites see religion as an obstacle not an asset .
the catholic church is a symbol of italy as is the lutheran church in germany and the anglican church in britain and the orthodox churches in eastern europe .
the euro elites want people from sicily to scandinavia to bow to them .
eliminating the religions that are associated with nations and replacing it with their rootless worship of international socialism then the eu elites can further their agenda against national sovereignty .
colin keesee , usa it 's a shame that no mention was made that the muslim man had requested an islamic symbol be represented along side the crucifix .
i 'm not sure i agree with going to court over such an issue when clearly in a country that is predominantly christian .
however , i believe that religious symbols should be removed and teaching kids about different faiths and religions is important to bridge the gap of ignorance between us all .
zak , uk in any country that went through the reformation this would be a non-issue .
but this is italy : the church still plays a massive role in the country 's political life and people 's mind set is not ready yet to deal with a society that only recently has started to become relatively multicultural .
religion should stay out of the classroom .
matteo garavoglia , italy , eu interestingly , many of the non-religious contributors seem to be as , or more , intolerant of religious expression than the religions they view with disdain as intolerant !
mark , scotland a crucifix in the classroom is the tip of the iceberg in italy vanessa , uk / italy unfortunately italy has the vatican within its borders , all the political parties try to seek favour with the catholic faith , see the recent debacle on the proposed law for a quick divorce .
i would ban crucifix not only in the schools , but in the courts -lrb- yes , they are present there too -rrb- .
i would ban the religious lessons in schools , taught by teachers that the bishop chooses , not the state education .
a crucifix in the class room is the tip of the iceberg in italy , the church interferes everywhere , unfortunately an , in my view , unpleasant man like smith has started this debate that has been long overdue .
vanessa , uk / italy the crucifix is as much a cultural symbol as a religious one .
it represents centuries of european civilisation and should not be lightly discarded .
richard cotton , london , uk the problem of separation of ' religion in schools ' would go away if the government followed the bastiat principle of limiting the law to its task and letting private institutions educate and provide services .
then the private institutions could be religious or a-religious and it would be fine .
ewan , uk it seems reasonable to remove the crucifix from the classroom if it affects the sentiments of people in the community .
however by taking out a so-called religious symbol , are we not endorsing another symbol ?
let 's just remember that having ' no symbols ' is not fair to all .
it is still subscribing to a particular view .
neil , india in the new europe whose culture is becoming dominated by -lrb- or reduced to -rrb- shopping centres , clearly the elite find the catholic church to be an obstacle to be suppressed .
clearly it is disadvantageous if people have things on their minds other than consumption .
the muslim minority is essentially a tool in the hands of the euro-buros in this case in the suppression of traditions that do not suit their taste .
balazs , italy all this fuss over religion - what about the kids ?
in schools they should be " educated " to be tolerant and loving !
plaster casts on walls or symbols of this or that are irrelevant .
it 's what 's taught them about love and international caring that matters - otherwise shut the schools !
stephen , thailand religious symbols should never be displayed in schools ... especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others keith , canada i believed italians were smart and educated - how can they allow such nonsense in a classroom and mislead their children ?
religion should be a personal matter and it should never be symbolised in a place where there are people of mixed or no faith .
amjad farooq , us i do not tend to agree with the judge 's decision .
if the other religion 's leader is not happy with the crucifix because this may influence muslim children in my opinion it would be more prudent if he asked to fix a muslim symbol on the walls near the catholic symbol .
alfred mallia , malta i think the separation of church and state is so heavily enforced in the west that in a way it actually promotes atheism .
i would prefer the way we handle this in bangladesh .
we are a multi-religious country where most of the major religions in the nation are recognised .
if i 'm not mistaken , the muslim leader initially asked for the school to put a muslim symbol beside the cross in the classroom , but the school refused .
i therefore support the judge 's decision to hold every religion with equal respect .
arif joarder , bangladesh religion should stay out of the classroom , period kent , canada it 's unfair that the initial suggestion by adel smith to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix should have been denied .
therefore it 's only fair that the crucifix be removed altogether to avoid creating a kind of religious superiority which is totally out of place in a multi-racial society .
patricia , italy it will inflame tensions between faiths , but i think it is a fair ruling as long all faiths are respected rodrigo , paraguay religious symbols have no place in a classroom .
religion is undoubtedly a private matter and should be kept so in the future .
neil jones , united kingdom religion should stay out of the classroom , period .
kent , canada italy was born -lrb- less than 150 years ago -rrb- when the laws of piedmont -lrb- a secular country -rrb- were extended to italy at unification .
italy stayed secular until fascism , when mussolini bought the support of the catholic church by turning back the clock on separation between religion and state .
hence the recent court judgment is in line with italy 's history and gives back to the italians the secular state that is part of their democratic traditions .
silvio sandrone , turin , piedmont -lrb- italy -rrb- muslims want to have religious rights in christian countries , do they grant the same rights to christians in muslim countries ?
adam schott , australia i strongly agree with the judge 's decision .
a fascist state was responsible for the current law .
this issue is a no-brainer and the vatican must be stopped from imposing its agenda on people who do not subscribe to it .
richard , us here in italy , we have one hour a week of confessional catholic teaching in every school .
if you do n't like that you have to opt-out .
in my opinion , that 's the problem , not the crucifix .
paolo , italy religious symbols should never be displayed in schools .
and especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others .
keith , canada in state schools there is no place for one religion over another john , france i do n't mind religious symbols in public -lrb- as art -rrb- .
however , as children are so susceptible to the ideas of others above their own , it seems inappropriate for public school to " endorse " any religion .
if children wish to express themselves -lrb- wearing crosses , headscarves -rrb- , this seems innocent .
it is the expression of the child and his or her family , rather than the state communicating a preference to the children .
aleta , united states i ca n't accept that a judge is trying to erase a part of our culture and history with a sentence .
and i ca n't accept that this request comes from a man who believes to be the head of italian muslims and who has always talked so badly of the catholic religion .
and so why do n't we sweep off the red cross symbol ?
michele , italy as a christian i strongly believe that the church and state must be kept separate and state must not and should not support or favour or endorse any one religion as this is a step toward state control of freedom .
crosses i feel are fine in home or in a local church but not in government-run institutions .
mark flanagan , sweden i ca n't help thinking that if it had been the opposite and a catholic had sought the removal of islamic symbols , they would have been slammed for being racist .
once again national culture and history are sacrificed on the altar of political correctness .
dean , uk all religious symbols should -lrb- must -rrb- be removed from public places and public use .
they should be allowed in places of worship of the particular religion / belief or in any individual 's home .
public no , schools no .
miklos nomad , hungary in state schools there is no place for one religion over another and there should be no display of any symbol - crucifix , head scarf or turban .
john , france of course it will inflame tensions between faiths .
italy is , and has within it , the centre of the catholic faith .
to coin a phrase " when in rome ! "
les woods , england / uk religion should be in schools only as part of history or psychology , studied with myths , legends , fairytales and superstitions .
nigel rees , uk / usa it will inflame tensions - europe has been christian for thousands of years and many will see this as foreigners removing our heritage .
tom , england a complete ban on all religious symbols on the walls of schools could be put in place to " show the unequivocal desire by the state ... to place atheism at the centre of the universe " .
whatever is done will be wrong .
as for inflaming tensions between religions , the whole effect of serious and committed religious belief is to preclude tolerance of others .
no religion has ever accepted that others have a right to exist let alone that they might also be correct in their beliefs .
after all their ' holy book ' proves that they are right .

a court decision to order a state kindergarten to remove crucifixes from its classrooms has caused controversy in italy .
the ruling by a judge in the central town of l 'aquila , following a complaint by an italian muslim leader , has re-opened a bitter debate about religious symbols .
the judge ruled that crucifixes on classroom walls showed " the unequivocal desire by the state , when it comes to public education , to place the catholic religion at the centre of the universe " , disregarding other religions .
do you agree with the decision ?
or could it inflame tensions between faiths ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think there should be no crucifixes in the classrooms .
its no problem for me that children learn about the christian religion but if so then why not to learn about all religions .
they should know other point of views to become more tolerant and to retard conflicts .
i grew up in poland with the crucifixes in the classrooms but now i live in germany .
i was told in the school to love all human beings but on the other hand i heard that the other religions are dangerous .
generally each religion can be dangerous .
bozena , germany crosses bearing idols of jesus breach the first commandment as does worship of jesus ' mother and should be banned everywhere .
as a christian i wear an empty cross to remind me there is no death , that i am free and i have promised to treat others as i would like to be treated .
all symbols are personal and should not be backed by government organisations , especially schools .
jesus directed we pray at home , in privacy .
if all followed his advice , there would be no churches with their power to exert power , gather wealth and manipulate gullible and superstitious people .
lionel hurst , australia this is clearly a problem of intolerance of the host country by an outsider , mr smith the muslim leader has also called for the removal of a 15th century christian fresco in bologna cathedral on the grounds that it shows the prophet mohammed this man is absolutely determined to ignore the fact that as a immigrant he should respect the culture and customs of his new adopted land .
yan michek , switzerland the cross simply says , " truth will set you free . "
it is thus the perfect symbol for what we call an education .
it shows us the cosmic relationship between truth and sacrifice .
but it is more that just a symbol .
it is a guide that helps us find meaning in notions like equality , democracy , love and it beckons us to love our neighbours as one .
it is a guide to peace .
who would dare take it down ?
taeho paik , italy why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- as an italian i 'm very happy about the judge 's decision , it 's about time the crucifixes get removed from state schools , and i know many other italians who think the same .
it 's only unfortunate the case was brought up by a muslim because this gives crucifix supporters an easy excuse to blame " foreigners " for destroying italy 's culture .
this has nothing to do with culture , as a non religious italian i demand crucifixes to be removed from any state building too , they belong in churches !
why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion that is loosing support fast in italy anyway ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- yes !
they should be banned in all ' state ' schools and establishments .
in a ' religious ' school of whatever faith , and where there are clear alternative schools where pupils can be sent , then they should be allowed .
this gives the choice of ' education and indoctrination ' to the parents of the pupils .
' religion ' should also be taken out of any school curricula .
if any parent wants their offspring to be educated in a ' religious ' way then let them go to the nearest appropriate religious establishment , be it a christian on or for any other religion .
b w moore , ne uk i think that everyone is missing the real reason behind the banning of the crucifix .
islam , judaism and christianity -lrb- in its true aramaic form -rrb- strictly forbid the use of idols , pictures etc depicting what prophets looked like .
this is primarily to stop the practice of idol worship which many modern day christians are accustomed to .
the crucifix in the past has been used as a tool by the missionaries to ' tame the savages ' into believing that jesus christ -lrb- peace be upon him -rrb- was a blonde-haired , blue-eyed european rather than a palestinian .
muslims are opposed to the depiction of the prophet jesus in this way .
they are not opposed to the fact that they are being misrepresented in the classroom !
e malik , uk as a roman catholic , i am shocked that one guy can change thousands of years of tradition .
italia is a catholic country and the cross is part of italia 's culture ... if mr. smith does n't like to raise his children in a place where catholics and catholic symbols are predominant , then he needs to pick up and move to saudi arabia or albania ... does it bother mr. smith that his children see the crosses on top of all the great churches of italy ?
should we remove all crosses and church towers around the catholic world , or should we just put a muslim symbol on top of each tower next to the cross to make it to his liking ?
should we not offer pork in our stores , because muslims do n't want to see it ?
marko latinovic , mostar , bosnia-herzegovina i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland in poland there are at least 95 % classrooms with crosses .
it is really funny and ironic .
people do n't care about them .
they should be removed as should be removed " religion " lesson - and moved to the church !
we 've got to learn about other religions too , how to live and understand others .
i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland italy 's constitution promises freedom of religion , just as most modern western constitutions do .
religious symbols are not appropriate in government schools .
christopher c. tew , usa groups come in and want to take over and change centuries of tradition and culture with one shout of discrimination .
if you choose to go to another country with a different culture and religion , it is the immigrant who has the responsibility for adapting , not the society itself .
gianna , usa i find it extremely depressing to see that , again , the wishes of a few surpass the wishes of the many .
culture and heritage are being erased in order to avoid offending the intolerant .
shannon simons , usa it 's common for christians to feel that this is an act against them , but so would the placing of other religion 's symbols next to their own .
the use of the crucifix to me is seems a bit like idol worship .
my relationship with god is not governed by having pictures laying around , but by the conversations we have .
wwill foster , usa the only option is to keep the state totally secular paul qureshi , uk if religious symbols are to be endorsed by the state and placed in classrooms , then all religions must be represented .
this raises two issues .
firstly , what constitutes a religion ?
many people put " jedi " on their census form , would that mean a light-sabre has to be on the wall too ?
secondly , many people would object to , say , satanist symbols , but they too would have to be displayed .
clearly , the only option is to keep the state and all state operated organisations totally secular .
this does not prevent anyone practicing their religion , nor force religion on them .
paul qureshi , uk like the old saying goes , " when in rome , do as the romans do . "
obviously , the muslim leader has never heard this before and does not understand the wisdom behind accepting the cultural aspect of one 's adopted country .
anthony , usa do n't forget that this man went to court when the school refused to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix in his children 's classroom .
so who is being intolerant here ?
if you 're for freedom of religion , let all religions have freedom .
if you 're for secularism , then ban all religious symbols .
people should n't use this issue to unfairly attack muslims yet again when it 's clear that the intolerance stems from others .
bilal patel , london , uk i am not very passionate about religion and this issue .
however , perhaps a better option would be to add some symbols of other religions and so to acknowledge and invite their contribution to national / local culture rather than pretending none of them counts or exists .
dariusz , poland but i would question why anyone would find this offensive jim , nj , usa the decision is technically correct because true democracies must be secular .
but i would question why anyone would find this offensive .
christ is n't going to jump off that cross and start converting children of other faiths by force .
the fact that the plaintiff originally wanted another religious symbol added , rather than the removal of the crucifix , proves he was not motivated by democratic ideals .
this is a case of a harmless tradition taken away for childish motives - " if i ca n't have my way , you ca n't have yours either " .
jim , nj , usa yes .
i agree with the ruling .
christians need to realize that they are just one religion with no more authenticity than any other .
tom cunningham , usa if you go to the beach , the wear a swimsuit .
if you 're going to a board meeting , you wear a three-piece suit .
if you going to school , you 're going to study math , literature , biology , and if you want to read the bible , koran , torah or whatever and pray and all that stuff , you go to church , which is where the cross belongs .
it 's very logical , very simple , and the rule of law .
a swimsuit would be out of place in the board room as would a three-piece suit at the beach .
can the cross - it 's out of place , and get over it .
let 's get on with education our young .
bobbi roman , usa what happens to christian residents in muslim countries ?
does any muslim judge dare to ban the half moon or whatever from classrooms in respect of christians ? ? ?
guests must respect the country in which they are hosted , its law and its traditions too .
host countries must surely respect their guests but must respect first their traditions and their native people .
fabio , italy children should not be indoctrinated with religion .
there is enough time when they are adults and more knowledgeable for them to decide if they want to join a religious group .
in the meantime , let us keep any kind of religious symbols out of the classrooms of public schools .
nyakairu , novi , usa like it or not , europe is the main place where christianity grew , in the same way the middle east and asia is where islam grew .
hence a lot of christian symbols here and a lot of islamic symbols in the middle east etc .
some largely muslim countries have crescents on their flags in the same way crosses often appear on european flags .
what we need is mutual respect which means muslims must respect our faith , culture and history in the same way they want us to respect theirs .
the judge 's decision was wrong because it will only cause resentment not respect .
fabian , uk by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed jose nigrin , guatemala when any country has a national recognized religion , the result will be the creation of second class citizens , that do n't profess this religion , and suffer discrimination in jobs , education , and opportunities for improvements .
by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed in favour of the main official credo .
jose nigrin , guatemala in public schools absolutely .
in religious ones , no problem .
leduc jean-francois , bangkok thailand what business does a crucifix have in a classroom to begin with ?
if you want to teach your children about a religion , go for it ; however that has nothing to do with public schooling .
if i were a school teacher and decided that i would like to have a statue of ganesh , i think i might get a little flack about it , so why should a crucifix be allowed ?
mike , usa as long as the teacher does not try to convert the children to a particular faith , we should not take away the right to free speech and beliefs .
gareth giles , england i think the cross should have stayed on the wall .
i would suggest , if the man disagrees with the symbol as much as that , then he take his children to a kindergarten that does not outwardly show it 's moral standpoint and not enforce oppression upon the other 99 % of class attendees callum w , uk many contributors are missing the point .
italy is a secular state , therefore the separation of state and religion -lrb- unlike the majority of muslim countries that profess nothing of the sort - the comparative argument thus being moot -rrb- .
the kindergarten being state run had no authority to place a catholic religious symbol in classrooms to the exclusion of all other religions .
the court 's decision was not only fair but based on the rule of law .
people who think otherwise are feeding the debate and controversy regarding islam and the west .
what they should remember is that the crux of all major world religions is tolerance .
h. schmitt , germany not banned nor compulsory .
states should not rule on religion .
people must be free to choose their faith and symbols .
ricardo , brazil the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions arif , england as muslim child i went to a church of england primary school , as did all my siblings .
we even went to church on numerous occasions with school !
in no way did this affect my religious identity or my faith .
all my family are devout muslims .
we never had any problems with the symbols of christianity that we visible in school .
the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions .
rather than removing symbols of christianity , symbols of other religions should be allowed in schools , so that we can celebrate or differences in a spirit of understanding , mutual respect and tolerance .
arif , england if the crucifix was on the wall of a catholic or christian school then what is the problem ?
if the muslim leader is in such a school and being in a predominantly christian country surely he must respect the local customs and cultures as he would expect anyone else to if they were in a muslim country , as others have said " when in rome etc . "
vivienne , uk a crucifix is a reminder that jesus the son of god died for our sins .
this is valid for moslems , jews , christians and atheists alike , even though some may not want to accept this truth .
aj , germany why should we remove the symbols of our faiths ?
i follow no religious order but i respect the views of people who do , if we went to muslim countries and started demanding they stop / remove items of their faith , we would be thrown out , this is pc gone mad , next thing on the hit list will be stopping xmas / easter etc .
and people wonder why extreme political parties are gaining ground , why does no one listen ?
j mulligan , uk how are children expected to learn about religion , if we keep banning it ?
surely this teaches intolerance !
susan , uk as dominant as christianity is in italy , the crucifix symbolizes centuries of oppression to those not of the faith .
the current saudi style of religious intolerance is no more extreme , or irrational , than that practiced by vatican inspired governments .
what islamic , jewish , hindi , wiccan , agnostic or atheistic child or adult benefits from the singular presence of a religious symbol in a secular learning environment ?
can the cross ?
amen !
ralph , usa it should be only displayed in religious schools manuel , macedonia the crucifix -lrb- which is , either you like it or not , a somewhat morbid symbol with jesus nailed on the cross , bleeding to death -rrb- and portrays the catholic religion with all the respect that it deserves , like any other religion .
therefore it should be only displayed in religious schools .
likewise , islam should abstain to portray religious symbols in non-religious schools .
islam should also refrain from getting into squabbling over religious issues as it will only lead to a growing divide between the west and muslim countries .
it is shameful that both religions fight over spirituality and the same god , despite the way he is perceived and loved by each other .
manuel , macedonia what 's next - banning christmas trees , carol singers and easter eggs ... they are all symbols of christian festivals ...
lisa , italy we think that it could be a good decision , because many and many italian do n't believe in god , especially young people and the school is lay and everyone could believe in what he or she wants .
anyway if someone wants a crucifix in his classroom , he has to allow everyone to put on the walls his own idols .
however we have to identify this case like a case of destroy the catholic religion at the base .
giovanni & riki , italy in our opinion , the cross is a religious symbol so it has n't to be on school 's walls because the school is lay institution .
so putting away from school 's walls the cross is right also because italy is a democratic country and it should n't impose its religion .
we 're christians so we believe in god but we think that the school is n't the place to show our religion because there are others buildings for this -lrb- churches -rrb- !
that 's all !
pamela & roberta , italy the crucifix is intrinsic to history anna , usa lately it seems we are bothered when there are mixed displays of sentiment and opinion .
the crucifix is intrinsic to history .
it is a monument of a culture and a movement and though you may not personally prescribe to it , it is still an integral part of the societies of today .
should we forget history because it bothers us ?
anna , usa faith / religion must be placed in the classroom .
it 's ignorant to deny its role in history , politics , culture ... and the day-to-day life of italy .
it 's bigoted to deny any metaphysical dimension to the world .
however , as a christian , i aint impressed with suppression of other religious views .
' elites ' set themselves up as religions ; but goodness knows what mr. keesee is banging on about : the eu ... international socialism . yeah right .
international capitalism more like !
you should pray for socialism if you care for god 's world .
andrew falconer , uk i agree .
religious symbols should be removed from any place of veneration in a secular school system .
larry , usa if italy truly has laws that apply to this situation , then i do n't have a problem with the ruling .
what i find sad though is that all this talk of multi-culturalism is really leading us to no-culturalism .
if everything that any one person disagrees with are banned , it will be a very boring world indeed that we leave to our children .
gary patterson , usa the cross should stay , when in rome do as the roman 's do .
n gorton , uk expat / canada why should n't there be religious symbols in schools ?
religions are part of human history .
religions are the base of the different cultures .
there is a lot of wisdom in all the different religions .
i think teaching about religions should be compulsory .
it is ignorance that creates intolerance , not knowledge .
harriet , singapore / nl it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around edwin thornber , uk / romania let muslim countries ban their religious symbols in their own countries before complaining about religious symbols in other countries .
it is surely a bit like complaining that italians speak italian .
it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around .
may be islam should be banned .
edwin thornber , uk / romania since christianity lies at the very foundation of european civilisation , history and law - and most especially italy 's - it is perfectly acceptable to have christian symbols in places where children are educated .
when we abandon the principles of christianity in order to please those of other faiths we tread a dangerous path .
dorothy , belgium i am an italian boy and my point of view is all religious symbols should be kept out from public schools and courts .
all religions must be respect each other , and one day we 'll live in a multi-cultural society .
italo p. , ripatransone italy i find it scary that signs of some religious affiliations are being banned , but others are somehow protected .
why is it ok to wear a headscarf , but not ok to wear a cross ?
why can children in the us swear and threaten their teachers in the name of free speech , but they can not pray in school ?
we have effectively removed god -lrb- by any name or form -rrb- from the public life in the us , now we wonder why our children lack direction and honour ?
sandra , us separating religion and state should be a must in all countries stefan , europe separating religion and state should be a must in all countries .
this means removing religious icons from classrooms , courthouses and other public places .
however there should also be freedom of religion .
this means that individuals should be allowed to wear a cross or a headscarf even in school or at work , individuals not government paid institutions should have the choice whether or not to display their religion publicly .
another option would be that public institutions should allow individuals to request their own religious symbol to be added if one of another religion is already present .
this might even help boost the tolerance between religions .
stefan , europe as an atheist i find all religious symbols to be at worst offensive and at best , irrelevant .
i would rather my children not have to observe these blinkered symbols of spiritual oppression , whichever of the main faiths they come from , they have no place in schools although nor does prayer or any other type of faith based activity .
john keegans , nottingham , uk this issue is primarily one of national sovereignty , as far as i am concerned .
there is clearly a general consensus and a deep-rooted tradition among the italians to display the crucifix symbol .
italy is not bound by the formal law in france of 1905 entirely separating religion and state , nor should it be made to bow to the whims of the eurocrats in brussels .
the way things are going , one day the flags of england , the uk , the scandinavian countries , and greece may be forced to remove their cross symbols on the grounds that they portray religious exclusivity .
jacob , uk those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue sean , belgium i could not imagine jesus christ or mohammed arguing over these symbols .
all parties involved have missed the point .
those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue .
the right to have the symbol is as strong as the right to remove the symbol .
let the children decide !
sean , belgium is italy not a predominantly catholic country ?
could a christian go to a muslim country and demand that they remove all islamic symbols ?
i think not .
if a muslim wants to reside in a christian country they have to tolerate the religion .
unlike in muslim countries where it is a crime to display crucifixes and possess bibles .
i can not believe the stupidity of the italian judge .
shame on him .
ben aldorino , uk i fail to see how the banning of religious symbols sends a message of multiculturalism and tolerance .
schools should encourage discussion about different religion and cultures because , far from being irrelevant , it seems to be increasingly relevant in the age we are living in .
helen , uk having lived and worked in saudi arabia for 11 years where you ca n't even wear a crucifix on a chain round you neck , take a bible into the kingdom , hold any kind of religious service , or even enter the city of mecca .
where they even stopped swiss air from flying into the kingdom because there plane had a red cross on the tailplane .
all i can say to this muslim leader in italy is " when in rome do as the romans do " and think him self lucky he has some where to go and pray in italy , because in arabia catholics and christians do n't .
r.l.tasker roger tasker , italy why should crosses or any religious symbols be removed ?
if we want a free , tolerant and open minded society , i see no reason why religious symbols should be banned .
i think the decision shows a lack of maturity - just another sign of cultural sanitisation .
js , norwich , uk it is strange that one insists that a cross be removed from a classroom and another is permitted a headscarf in the classroom .
looks like some have their cake and get to eat it .
doug , sweden such traditions are difficult to change , but the value of having a genuinely secular state is now known to be strongly positive .
the change is correct .
cliff , usa the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision raimundo l. santos , brazil the crucifix is an important symbol for christians .
as a catholic i do n't see any point in removing our christian symbols for fear any other religion would not like or approve of it .
if i were living in a muslim country for example , i would n't feel scandalized just to see women in their burkas and veils , or men wearing their turbans .
moreover , i suppose " judges " or the like in muslim countries are not really concerned if we christians approve or disapprove of their habits and customs , so why should we ?
the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision , which might as well offend catholics .
raimundo l. santos , brazil if italy 's present laws do , at least on paper , separate the church from the state , then it definitely should have been removed .
i 'm actually surprised this is getting so much attention - while living in italy , going to church in italy , i found most italians did n't regularly attend church .
as for christians in muslim countries , mentioned below - perhaps that 's why these muslims do not live in said countries ?
christina , usa the eu elites see religion as an obstacle not an asset .
the catholic church is a symbol of italy as is the lutheran church in germany and the anglican church in britain and the orthodox churches in eastern europe .
the euro elites want people from sicily to scandinavia to bow to them .
eliminating the religions that are associated with nations and replacing it with their rootless worship of international socialism then the eu elites can further their agenda against national sovereignty .
colin keesee , usa it 's a shame that no mention was made that the muslim man had requested an islamic symbol be represented along side the crucifix .
i 'm not sure i agree with going to court over such an issue when clearly in a country that is predominantly christian .
however , i believe that religious symbols should be removed and teaching kids about different faiths and religions is important to bridge the gap of ignorance between us all .
zak , uk in any country that went through the reformation this would be a non-issue .
but this is italy : the church still plays a massive role in the country 's political life and people 's mind set is not ready yet to deal with a society that only recently has started to become relatively multicultural .
religion should stay out of the classroom .
matteo garavoglia , italy , eu interestingly , many of the non-religious contributors seem to be as , or more , intolerant of religious expression than the religions they view with disdain as intolerant !
mark , scotland a crucifix in the classroom is the tip of the iceberg in italy vanessa , uk / italy unfortunately italy has the vatican within its borders , all the political parties try to seek favour with the catholic faith , see the recent debacle on the proposed law for a quick divorce .
i would ban crucifix not only in the schools , but in the courts -lrb- yes , they are present there too -rrb- .
i would ban the religious lessons in schools , taught by teachers that the bishop chooses , not the state education .
a crucifix in the class room is the tip of the iceberg in italy , the church interferes everywhere , unfortunately an , in my view , unpleasant man like smith has started this debate that has been long overdue .
vanessa , uk / italy the crucifix is as much a cultural symbol as a religious one .
it represents centuries of european civilisation and should not be lightly discarded .
richard cotton , london , uk the problem of separation of ' religion in schools ' would go away if the government followed the bastiat principle of limiting the law to its task and letting private institutions educate and provide services .
then the private institutions could be religious or a-religious and it would be fine .
ewan , uk it seems reasonable to remove the crucifix from the classroom if it affects the sentiments of people in the community .
however by taking out a so-called religious symbol , are we not endorsing another symbol ?
let 's just remember that having ' no symbols ' is not fair to all .
it is still subscribing to a particular view .
neil , india in the new europe whose culture is becoming dominated by -lrb- or reduced to -rrb- shopping centres , clearly the elite find the catholic church to be an obstacle to be suppressed .
clearly it is disadvantageous if people have things on their minds other than consumption .
the muslim minority is essentially a tool in the hands of the euro-buros in this case in the suppression of traditions that do not suit their taste .
balazs , italy all this fuss over religion - what about the kids ?
in schools they should be " educated " to be tolerant and loving !
plaster casts on walls or symbols of this or that are irrelevant .
it 's what 's taught them about love and international caring that matters - otherwise shut the schools !
stephen , thailand religious symbols should never be displayed in schools ... especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others keith , canada i believed italians were smart and educated - how can they allow such nonsense in a classroom and mislead their children ?
religion should be a personal matter and it should never be symbolised in a place where there are people of mixed or no faith .
amjad farooq , us i do not tend to agree with the judge 's decision .
if the other religion 's leader is not happy with the crucifix because this may influence muslim children in my opinion it would be more prudent if he asked to fix a muslim symbol on the walls near the catholic symbol .
alfred mallia , malta i think the separation of church and state is so heavily enforced in the west that in a way it actually promotes atheism .
i would prefer the way we handle this in bangladesh .
we are a multi-religious country where most of the major religions in the nation are recognised .
if i 'm not mistaken , the muslim leader initially asked for the school to put a muslim symbol beside the cross in the classroom , but the school refused .
i therefore support the judge 's decision to hold every religion with equal respect .
arif joarder , bangladesh religion should stay out of the classroom , period kent , canada it 's unfair that the initial suggestion by adel smith to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix should have been denied .
therefore it 's only fair that the crucifix be removed altogether to avoid creating a kind of religious superiority which is totally out of place in a multi-racial society .
patricia , italy it will inflame tensions between faiths , but i think it is a fair ruling as long all faiths are respected rodrigo , paraguay religious symbols have no place in a classroom .
religion is undoubtedly a private matter and should be kept so in the future .
neil jones , united kingdom religion should stay out of the classroom , period .
kent , canada italy was born -lrb- less than 150 years ago -rrb- when the laws of piedmont -lrb- a secular country -rrb- were extended to italy at unification .
italy stayed secular until fascism , when mussolini bought the support of the catholic church by turning back the clock on separation between religion and state .
hence the recent court judgment is in line with italy 's history and gives back to the italians the secular state that is part of their democratic traditions .
silvio sandrone , turin , piedmont -lrb- italy -rrb- muslims want to have religious rights in christian countries , do they grant the same rights to christians in muslim countries ?
adam schott , australia i strongly agree with the judge 's decision .
a fascist state was responsible for the current law .
this issue is a no-brainer and the vatican must be stopped from imposing its agenda on people who do not subscribe to it .
richard , us here in italy , we have one hour a week of confessional catholic teaching in every school .
if you do n't like that you have to opt-out .
in my opinion , that 's the problem , not the crucifix .
paolo , italy religious symbols should never be displayed in schools .
and especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others .
keith , canada in state schools there is no place for one religion over another john , france i do n't mind religious symbols in public -lrb- as art -rrb- .
however , as children are so susceptible to the ideas of others above their own , it seems inappropriate for public school to " endorse " any religion .
if children wish to express themselves -lrb- wearing crosses , headscarves -rrb- , this seems innocent .
it is the expression of the child and his or her family , rather than the state communicating a preference to the children .
aleta , united states i ca n't accept that a judge is trying to erase a part of our culture and history with a sentence .
and i ca n't accept that this request comes from a man who believes to be the head of italian muslims and who has always talked so badly of the catholic religion .
and so why do n't we sweep off the red cross symbol ?
michele , italy as a christian i strongly believe that the church and state must be kept separate and state must not and should not support or favour or endorse any one religion as this is a step toward state control of freedom .
crosses i feel are fine in home or in a local church but not in government-run institutions .
mark flanagan , sweden i ca n't help thinking that if it had been the opposite and a catholic had sought the removal of islamic symbols , they would have been slammed for being racist .
once again national culture and history are sacrificed on the altar of political correctness .
dean , uk all religious symbols should -lrb- must -rrb- be removed from public places and public use .
they should be allowed in places of worship of the particular religion / belief or in any individual 's home .
public no , schools no .
miklos nomad , hungary in state schools there is no place for one religion over another and there should be no display of any symbol - crucifix , head scarf or turban .
john , france of course it will inflame tensions between faiths .
italy is , and has within it , the centre of the catholic faith .
to coin a phrase " when in rome ! "
les woods , england / uk religion should be in schools only as part of history or psychology , studied with myths , legends , fairytales and superstitions .
nigel rees , uk / usa it will inflame tensions - europe has been christian for thousands of years and many will see this as foreigners removing our heritage .
tom , england a complete ban on all religious symbols on the walls of schools could be put in place to " show the unequivocal desire by the state ... to place atheism at the centre of the universe " .
whatever is done will be wrong .
as for inflaming tensions between religions , the whole effect of serious and committed religious belief is to preclude tolerance of others .
no religion has ever accepted that others have a right to exist let alone that they might also be correct in their beliefs .
after all their ' holy book ' proves that they are right .

a court decision to order a state kindergarten to remove crucifixes from its classrooms has caused controversy in italy .
the ruling by a judge in the central town of l 'aquila , following a complaint by an italian muslim leader , has re-opened a bitter debate about religious symbols .
the judge ruled that crucifixes on classroom walls showed " the unequivocal desire by the state , when it comes to public education , to place the catholic religion at the centre of the universe " , disregarding other religions .
do you agree with the decision ?
or could it inflame tensions between faiths ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think there should be no crucifixes in the classrooms .
its no problem for me that children learn about the christian religion but if so then why not to learn about all religions .
they should know other point of views to become more tolerant and to retard conflicts .
i grew up in poland with the crucifixes in the classrooms but now i live in germany .
i was told in the school to love all human beings but on the other hand i heard that the other religions are dangerous .
generally each religion can be dangerous .
bozena , germany crosses bearing idols of jesus breach the first commandment as does worship of jesus ' mother and should be banned everywhere .
as a christian i wear an empty cross to remind me there is no death , that i am free and i have promised to treat others as i would like to be treated .
all symbols are personal and should not be backed by government organisations , especially schools .
jesus directed we pray at home , in privacy .
if all followed his advice , there would be no churches with their power to exert power , gather wealth and manipulate gullible and superstitious people .
lionel hurst , australia this is clearly a problem of intolerance of the host country by an outsider , mr smith the muslim leader has also called for the removal of a 15th century christian fresco in bologna cathedral on the grounds that it shows the prophet mohammed this man is absolutely determined to ignore the fact that as a immigrant he should respect the culture and customs of his new adopted land .
yan michek , switzerland the cross simply says , " truth will set you free . "
it is thus the perfect symbol for what we call an education .
it shows us the cosmic relationship between truth and sacrifice .
but it is more that just a symbol .
it is a guide that helps us find meaning in notions like equality , democracy , love and it beckons us to love our neighbours as one .
it is a guide to peace .
who would dare take it down ?
taeho paik , italy why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- as an italian i 'm very happy about the judge 's decision , it 's about time the crucifixes get removed from state schools , and i know many other italians who think the same .
it 's only unfortunate the case was brought up by a muslim because this gives crucifix supporters an easy excuse to blame " foreigners " for destroying italy 's culture .
this has nothing to do with culture , as a non religious italian i demand crucifixes to be removed from any state building too , they belong in churches !
why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion that is loosing support fast in italy anyway ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- yes !
they should be banned in all ' state ' schools and establishments .
in a ' religious ' school of whatever faith , and where there are clear alternative schools where pupils can be sent , then they should be allowed .
this gives the choice of ' education and indoctrination ' to the parents of the pupils .
' religion ' should also be taken out of any school curricula .
if any parent wants their offspring to be educated in a ' religious ' way then let them go to the nearest appropriate religious establishment , be it a christian on or for any other religion .
b w moore , ne uk i think that everyone is missing the real reason behind the banning of the crucifix .
islam , judaism and christianity -lrb- in its true aramaic form -rrb- strictly forbid the use of idols , pictures etc depicting what prophets looked like .
this is primarily to stop the practice of idol worship which many modern day christians are accustomed to .
the crucifix in the past has been used as a tool by the missionaries to ' tame the savages ' into believing that jesus christ -lrb- peace be upon him -rrb- was a blonde-haired , blue-eyed european rather than a palestinian .
muslims are opposed to the depiction of the prophet jesus in this way .
they are not opposed to the fact that they are being misrepresented in the classroom !
e malik , uk as a roman catholic , i am shocked that one guy can change thousands of years of tradition .
italia is a catholic country and the cross is part of italia 's culture ... if mr. smith does n't like to raise his children in a place where catholics and catholic symbols are predominant , then he needs to pick up and move to saudi arabia or albania ... does it bother mr. smith that his children see the crosses on top of all the great churches of italy ?
should we remove all crosses and church towers around the catholic world , or should we just put a muslim symbol on top of each tower next to the cross to make it to his liking ?
should we not offer pork in our stores , because muslims do n't want to see it ?
marko latinovic , mostar , bosnia-herzegovina i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland in poland there are at least 95 % classrooms with crosses .
it is really funny and ironic .
people do n't care about them .
they should be removed as should be removed " religion " lesson - and moved to the church !
we 've got to learn about other religions too , how to live and understand others .
i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland italy 's constitution promises freedom of religion , just as most modern western constitutions do .
religious symbols are not appropriate in government schools .
christopher c. tew , usa groups come in and want to take over and change centuries of tradition and culture with one shout of discrimination .
if you choose to go to another country with a different culture and religion , it is the immigrant who has the responsibility for adapting , not the society itself .
gianna , usa i find it extremely depressing to see that , again , the wishes of a few surpass the wishes of the many .
culture and heritage are being erased in order to avoid offending the intolerant .
shannon simons , usa it 's common for christians to feel that this is an act against them , but so would the placing of other religion 's symbols next to their own .
the use of the crucifix to me is seems a bit like idol worship .
my relationship with god is not governed by having pictures laying around , but by the conversations we have .
wwill foster , usa the only option is to keep the state totally secular paul qureshi , uk if religious symbols are to be endorsed by the state and placed in classrooms , then all religions must be represented .
this raises two issues .
firstly , what constitutes a religion ?
many people put " jedi " on their census form , would that mean a light-sabre has to be on the wall too ?
secondly , many people would object to , say , satanist symbols , but they too would have to be displayed .
clearly , the only option is to keep the state and all state operated organisations totally secular .
this does not prevent anyone practicing their religion , nor force religion on them .
paul qureshi , uk like the old saying goes , " when in rome , do as the romans do . "
obviously , the muslim leader has never heard this before and does not understand the wisdom behind accepting the cultural aspect of one 's adopted country .
anthony , usa do n't forget that this man went to court when the school refused to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix in his children 's classroom .
so who is being intolerant here ?
if you 're for freedom of religion , let all religions have freedom .
if you 're for secularism , then ban all religious symbols .
people should n't use this issue to unfairly attack muslims yet again when it 's clear that the intolerance stems from others .
bilal patel , london , uk i am not very passionate about religion and this issue .
however , perhaps a better option would be to add some symbols of other religions and so to acknowledge and invite their contribution to national / local culture rather than pretending none of them counts or exists .
dariusz , poland but i would question why anyone would find this offensive jim , nj , usa the decision is technically correct because true democracies must be secular .
but i would question why anyone would find this offensive .
christ is n't going to jump off that cross and start converting children of other faiths by force .
the fact that the plaintiff originally wanted another religious symbol added , rather than the removal of the crucifix , proves he was not motivated by democratic ideals .
this is a case of a harmless tradition taken away for childish motives - " if i ca n't have my way , you ca n't have yours either " .
jim , nj , usa yes .
i agree with the ruling .
christians need to realize that they are just one religion with no more authenticity than any other .
tom cunningham , usa if you go to the beach , the wear a swimsuit .
if you 're going to a board meeting , you wear a three-piece suit .
if you going to school , you 're going to study math , literature , biology , and if you want to read the bible , koran , torah or whatever and pray and all that stuff , you go to church , which is where the cross belongs .
it 's very logical , very simple , and the rule of law .
a swimsuit would be out of place in the board room as would a three-piece suit at the beach .
can the cross - it 's out of place , and get over it .
let 's get on with education our young .
bobbi roman , usa what happens to christian residents in muslim countries ?
does any muslim judge dare to ban the half moon or whatever from classrooms in respect of christians ? ? ?
guests must respect the country in which they are hosted , its law and its traditions too .
host countries must surely respect their guests but must respect first their traditions and their native people .
fabio , italy children should not be indoctrinated with religion .
there is enough time when they are adults and more knowledgeable for them to decide if they want to join a religious group .
in the meantime , let us keep any kind of religious symbols out of the classrooms of public schools .
nyakairu , novi , usa like it or not , europe is the main place where christianity grew , in the same way the middle east and asia is where islam grew .
hence a lot of christian symbols here and a lot of islamic symbols in the middle east etc .
some largely muslim countries have crescents on their flags in the same way crosses often appear on european flags .
what we need is mutual respect which means muslims must respect our faith , culture and history in the same way they want us to respect theirs .
the judge 's decision was wrong because it will only cause resentment not respect .
fabian , uk by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed jose nigrin , guatemala when any country has a national recognized religion , the result will be the creation of second class citizens , that do n't profess this religion , and suffer discrimination in jobs , education , and opportunities for improvements .
by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed in favour of the main official credo .
jose nigrin , guatemala in public schools absolutely .
in religious ones , no problem .
leduc jean-francois , bangkok thailand what business does a crucifix have in a classroom to begin with ?
if you want to teach your children about a religion , go for it ; however that has nothing to do with public schooling .
if i were a school teacher and decided that i would like to have a statue of ganesh , i think i might get a little flack about it , so why should a crucifix be allowed ?
mike , usa as long as the teacher does not try to convert the children to a particular faith , we should not take away the right to free speech and beliefs .
gareth giles , england i think the cross should have stayed on the wall .
i would suggest , if the man disagrees with the symbol as much as that , then he take his children to a kindergarten that does not outwardly show it 's moral standpoint and not enforce oppression upon the other 99 % of class attendees callum w , uk many contributors are missing the point .
italy is a secular state , therefore the separation of state and religion -lrb- unlike the majority of muslim countries that profess nothing of the sort - the comparative argument thus being moot -rrb- .
the kindergarten being state run had no authority to place a catholic religious symbol in classrooms to the exclusion of all other religions .
the court 's decision was not only fair but based on the rule of law .
people who think otherwise are feeding the debate and controversy regarding islam and the west .
what they should remember is that the crux of all major world religions is tolerance .
h. schmitt , germany not banned nor compulsory .
states should not rule on religion .
people must be free to choose their faith and symbols .
ricardo , brazil the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions arif , england as muslim child i went to a church of england primary school , as did all my siblings .
we even went to church on numerous occasions with school !
in no way did this affect my religious identity or my faith .
all my family are devout muslims .
we never had any problems with the symbols of christianity that we visible in school .
the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions .
rather than removing symbols of christianity , symbols of other religions should be allowed in schools , so that we can celebrate or differences in a spirit of understanding , mutual respect and tolerance .
arif , england if the crucifix was on the wall of a catholic or christian school then what is the problem ?
if the muslim leader is in such a school and being in a predominantly christian country surely he must respect the local customs and cultures as he would expect anyone else to if they were in a muslim country , as others have said " when in rome etc . "
vivienne , uk a crucifix is a reminder that jesus the son of god died for our sins .
this is valid for moslems , jews , christians and atheists alike , even though some may not want to accept this truth .
aj , germany why should we remove the symbols of our faiths ?
i follow no religious order but i respect the views of people who do , if we went to muslim countries and started demanding they stop / remove items of their faith , we would be thrown out , this is pc gone mad , next thing on the hit list will be stopping xmas / easter etc .
and people wonder why extreme political parties are gaining ground , why does no one listen ?
j mulligan , uk how are children expected to learn about religion , if we keep banning it ?
surely this teaches intolerance !
susan , uk as dominant as christianity is in italy , the crucifix symbolizes centuries of oppression to those not of the faith .
the current saudi style of religious intolerance is no more extreme , or irrational , than that practiced by vatican inspired governments .
what islamic , jewish , hindi , wiccan , agnostic or atheistic child or adult benefits from the singular presence of a religious symbol in a secular learning environment ?
can the cross ?
amen !
ralph , usa it should be only displayed in religious schools manuel , macedonia the crucifix -lrb- which is , either you like it or not , a somewhat morbid symbol with jesus nailed on the cross , bleeding to death -rrb- and portrays the catholic religion with all the respect that it deserves , like any other religion .
therefore it should be only displayed in religious schools .
likewise , islam should abstain to portray religious symbols in non-religious schools .
islam should also refrain from getting into squabbling over religious issues as it will only lead to a growing divide between the west and muslim countries .
it is shameful that both religions fight over spirituality and the same god , despite the way he is perceived and loved by each other .
manuel , macedonia what 's next - banning christmas trees , carol singers and easter eggs ... they are all symbols of christian festivals ...
lisa , italy we think that it could be a good decision , because many and many italian do n't believe in god , especially young people and the school is lay and everyone could believe in what he or she wants .
anyway if someone wants a crucifix in his classroom , he has to allow everyone to put on the walls his own idols .
however we have to identify this case like a case of destroy the catholic religion at the base .
giovanni & riki , italy in our opinion , the cross is a religious symbol so it has n't to be on school 's walls because the school is lay institution .
so putting away from school 's walls the cross is right also because italy is a democratic country and it should n't impose its religion .
we 're christians so we believe in god but we think that the school is n't the place to show our religion because there are others buildings for this -lrb- churches -rrb- !
that 's all !
pamela & roberta , italy the crucifix is intrinsic to history anna , usa lately it seems we are bothered when there are mixed displays of sentiment and opinion .
the crucifix is intrinsic to history .
it is a monument of a culture and a movement and though you may not personally prescribe to it , it is still an integral part of the societies of today .
should we forget history because it bothers us ?
anna , usa faith / religion must be placed in the classroom .
it 's ignorant to deny its role in history , politics , culture ... and the day-to-day life of italy .
it 's bigoted to deny any metaphysical dimension to the world .
however , as a christian , i aint impressed with suppression of other religious views .
' elites ' set themselves up as religions ; but goodness knows what mr. keesee is banging on about : the eu ... international socialism . yeah right .
international capitalism more like !
you should pray for socialism if you care for god 's world .
andrew falconer , uk i agree .
religious symbols should be removed from any place of veneration in a secular school system .
larry , usa if italy truly has laws that apply to this situation , then i do n't have a problem with the ruling .
what i find sad though is that all this talk of multi-culturalism is really leading us to no-culturalism .
if everything that any one person disagrees with are banned , it will be a very boring world indeed that we leave to our children .
gary patterson , usa the cross should stay , when in rome do as the roman 's do .
n gorton , uk expat / canada why should n't there be religious symbols in schools ?
religions are part of human history .
religions are the base of the different cultures .
there is a lot of wisdom in all the different religions .
i think teaching about religions should be compulsory .
it is ignorance that creates intolerance , not knowledge .
harriet , singapore / nl it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around edwin thornber , uk / romania let muslim countries ban their religious symbols in their own countries before complaining about religious symbols in other countries .
it is surely a bit like complaining that italians speak italian .
it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around .
may be islam should be banned .
edwin thornber , uk / romania since christianity lies at the very foundation of european civilisation , history and law - and most especially italy 's - it is perfectly acceptable to have christian symbols in places where children are educated .
when we abandon the principles of christianity in order to please those of other faiths we tread a dangerous path .
dorothy , belgium i am an italian boy and my point of view is all religious symbols should be kept out from public schools and courts .
all religions must be respect each other , and one day we 'll live in a multi-cultural society .
italo p. , ripatransone italy i find it scary that signs of some religious affiliations are being banned , but others are somehow protected .
why is it ok to wear a headscarf , but not ok to wear a cross ?
why can children in the us swear and threaten their teachers in the name of free speech , but they can not pray in school ?
we have effectively removed god -lrb- by any name or form -rrb- from the public life in the us , now we wonder why our children lack direction and honour ?
sandra , us separating religion and state should be a must in all countries stefan , europe separating religion and state should be a must in all countries .
this means removing religious icons from classrooms , courthouses and other public places .
however there should also be freedom of religion .
this means that individuals should be allowed to wear a cross or a headscarf even in school or at work , individuals not government paid institutions should have the choice whether or not to display their religion publicly .
another option would be that public institutions should allow individuals to request their own religious symbol to be added if one of another religion is already present .
this might even help boost the tolerance between religions .
stefan , europe as an atheist i find all religious symbols to be at worst offensive and at best , irrelevant .
i would rather my children not have to observe these blinkered symbols of spiritual oppression , whichever of the main faiths they come from , they have no place in schools although nor does prayer or any other type of faith based activity .
john keegans , nottingham , uk this issue is primarily one of national sovereignty , as far as i am concerned .
there is clearly a general consensus and a deep-rooted tradition among the italians to display the crucifix symbol .
italy is not bound by the formal law in france of 1905 entirely separating religion and state , nor should it be made to bow to the whims of the eurocrats in brussels .
the way things are going , one day the flags of england , the uk , the scandinavian countries , and greece may be forced to remove their cross symbols on the grounds that they portray religious exclusivity .
jacob , uk those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue sean , belgium i could not imagine jesus christ or mohammed arguing over these symbols .
all parties involved have missed the point .
those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue .
the right to have the symbol is as strong as the right to remove the symbol .
let the children decide !
sean , belgium is italy not a predominantly catholic country ?
could a christian go to a muslim country and demand that they remove all islamic symbols ?
i think not .
if a muslim wants to reside in a christian country they have to tolerate the religion .
unlike in muslim countries where it is a crime to display crucifixes and possess bibles .
i can not believe the stupidity of the italian judge .
shame on him .
ben aldorino , uk i fail to see how the banning of religious symbols sends a message of multiculturalism and tolerance .
schools should encourage discussion about different religion and cultures because , far from being irrelevant , it seems to be increasingly relevant in the age we are living in .
helen , uk having lived and worked in saudi arabia for 11 years where you ca n't even wear a crucifix on a chain round you neck , take a bible into the kingdom , hold any kind of religious service , or even enter the city of mecca .
where they even stopped swiss air from flying into the kingdom because there plane had a red cross on the tailplane .
all i can say to this muslim leader in italy is " when in rome do as the romans do " and think him self lucky he has some where to go and pray in italy , because in arabia catholics and christians do n't .
r.l.tasker roger tasker , italy why should crosses or any religious symbols be removed ?
if we want a free , tolerant and open minded society , i see no reason why religious symbols should be banned .
i think the decision shows a lack of maturity - just another sign of cultural sanitisation .
js , norwich , uk it is strange that one insists that a cross be removed from a classroom and another is permitted a headscarf in the classroom .
looks like some have their cake and get to eat it .
doug , sweden such traditions are difficult to change , but the value of having a genuinely secular state is now known to be strongly positive .
the change is correct .
cliff , usa the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision raimundo l. santos , brazil the crucifix is an important symbol for christians .
as a catholic i do n't see any point in removing our christian symbols for fear any other religion would not like or approve of it .
if i were living in a muslim country for example , i would n't feel scandalized just to see women in their burkas and veils , or men wearing their turbans .
moreover , i suppose " judges " or the like in muslim countries are not really concerned if we christians approve or disapprove of their habits and customs , so why should we ?
the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision , which might as well offend catholics .
raimundo l. santos , brazil if italy 's present laws do , at least on paper , separate the church from the state , then it definitely should have been removed .
i 'm actually surprised this is getting so much attention - while living in italy , going to church in italy , i found most italians did n't regularly attend church .
as for christians in muslim countries , mentioned below - perhaps that 's why these muslims do not live in said countries ?
christina , usa the eu elites see religion as an obstacle not an asset .
the catholic church is a symbol of italy as is the lutheran church in germany and the anglican church in britain and the orthodox churches in eastern europe .
the euro elites want people from sicily to scandinavia to bow to them .
eliminating the religions that are associated with nations and replacing it with their rootless worship of international socialism then the eu elites can further their agenda against national sovereignty .
colin keesee , usa it 's a shame that no mention was made that the muslim man had requested an islamic symbol be represented along side the crucifix .
i 'm not sure i agree with going to court over such an issue when clearly in a country that is predominantly christian .
however , i believe that religious symbols should be removed and teaching kids about different faiths and religions is important to bridge the gap of ignorance between us all .
zak , uk in any country that went through the reformation this would be a non-issue .
but this is italy : the church still plays a massive role in the country 's political life and people 's mind set is not ready yet to deal with a society that only recently has started to become relatively multicultural .
religion should stay out of the classroom .
matteo garavoglia , italy , eu interestingly , many of the non-religious contributors seem to be as , or more , intolerant of religious expression than the religions they view with disdain as intolerant !
mark , scotland a crucifix in the classroom is the tip of the iceberg in italy vanessa , uk / italy unfortunately italy has the vatican within its borders , all the political parties try to seek favour with the catholic faith , see the recent debacle on the proposed law for a quick divorce .
i would ban crucifix not only in the schools , but in the courts -lrb- yes , they are present there too -rrb- .
i would ban the religious lessons in schools , taught by teachers that the bishop chooses , not the state education .
a crucifix in the class room is the tip of the iceberg in italy , the church interferes everywhere , unfortunately an , in my view , unpleasant man like smith has started this debate that has been long overdue .
vanessa , uk / italy the crucifix is as much a cultural symbol as a religious one .
it represents centuries of european civilisation and should not be lightly discarded .
richard cotton , london , uk the problem of separation of ' religion in schools ' would go away if the government followed the bastiat principle of limiting the law to its task and letting private institutions educate and provide services .
then the private institutions could be religious or a-religious and it would be fine .
ewan , uk it seems reasonable to remove the crucifix from the classroom if it affects the sentiments of people in the community .
however by taking out a so-called religious symbol , are we not endorsing another symbol ?
let 's just remember that having ' no symbols ' is not fair to all .
it is still subscribing to a particular view .
neil , india in the new europe whose culture is becoming dominated by -lrb- or reduced to -rrb- shopping centres , clearly the elite find the catholic church to be an obstacle to be suppressed .
clearly it is disadvantageous if people have things on their minds other than consumption .
the muslim minority is essentially a tool in the hands of the euro-buros in this case in the suppression of traditions that do not suit their taste .
balazs , italy all this fuss over religion - what about the kids ?
in schools they should be " educated " to be tolerant and loving !
plaster casts on walls or symbols of this or that are irrelevant .
it 's what 's taught them about love and international caring that matters - otherwise shut the schools !
stephen , thailand religious symbols should never be displayed in schools ... especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others keith , canada i believed italians were smart and educated - how can they allow such nonsense in a classroom and mislead their children ?
religion should be a personal matter and it should never be symbolised in a place where there are people of mixed or no faith .
amjad farooq , us i do not tend to agree with the judge 's decision .
if the other religion 's leader is not happy with the crucifix because this may influence muslim children in my opinion it would be more prudent if he asked to fix a muslim symbol on the walls near the catholic symbol .
alfred mallia , malta i think the separation of church and state is so heavily enforced in the west that in a way it actually promotes atheism .
i would prefer the way we handle this in bangladesh .
we are a multi-religious country where most of the major religions in the nation are recognised .
if i 'm not mistaken , the muslim leader initially asked for the school to put a muslim symbol beside the cross in the classroom , but the school refused .
i therefore support the judge 's decision to hold every religion with equal respect .
arif joarder , bangladesh religion should stay out of the classroom , period kent , canada it 's unfair that the initial suggestion by adel smith to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix should have been denied .
therefore it 's only fair that the crucifix be removed altogether to avoid creating a kind of religious superiority which is totally out of place in a multi-racial society .
patricia , italy it will inflame tensions between faiths , but i think it is a fair ruling as long all faiths are respected rodrigo , paraguay religious symbols have no place in a classroom .
religion is undoubtedly a private matter and should be kept so in the future .
neil jones , united kingdom religion should stay out of the classroom , period .
kent , canada italy was born -lrb- less than 150 years ago -rrb- when the laws of piedmont -lrb- a secular country -rrb- were extended to italy at unification .
italy stayed secular until fascism , when mussolini bought the support of the catholic church by turning back the clock on separation between religion and state .
hence the recent court judgment is in line with italy 's history and gives back to the italians the secular state that is part of their democratic traditions .
silvio sandrone , turin , piedmont -lrb- italy -rrb- muslims want to have religious rights in christian countries , do they grant the same rights to christians in muslim countries ?
adam schott , australia i strongly agree with the judge 's decision .
a fascist state was responsible for the current law .
this issue is a no-brainer and the vatican must be stopped from imposing its agenda on people who do not subscribe to it .
richard , us here in italy , we have one hour a week of confessional catholic teaching in every school .
if you do n't like that you have to opt-out .
in my opinion , that 's the problem , not the crucifix .
paolo , italy religious symbols should never be displayed in schools .
and especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others .
keith , canada in state schools there is no place for one religion over another john , france i do n't mind religious symbols in public -lrb- as art -rrb- .
however , as children are so susceptible to the ideas of others above their own , it seems inappropriate for public school to " endorse " any religion .
if children wish to express themselves -lrb- wearing crosses , headscarves -rrb- , this seems innocent .
it is the expression of the child and his or her family , rather than the state communicating a preference to the children .
aleta , united states i ca n't accept that a judge is trying to erase a part of our culture and history with a sentence .
and i ca n't accept that this request comes from a man who believes to be the head of italian muslims and who has always talked so badly of the catholic religion .
and so why do n't we sweep off the red cross symbol ?
michele , italy as a christian i strongly believe that the church and state must be kept separate and state must not and should not support or favour or endorse any one religion as this is a step toward state control of freedom .
crosses i feel are fine in home or in a local church but not in government-run institutions .
mark flanagan , sweden i ca n't help thinking that if it had been the opposite and a catholic had sought the removal of islamic symbols , they would have been slammed for being racist .
once again national culture and history are sacrificed on the altar of political correctness .
dean , uk all religious symbols should -lrb- must -rrb- be removed from public places and public use .
they should be allowed in places of worship of the particular religion / belief or in any individual 's home .
public no , schools no .
miklos nomad , hungary in state schools there is no place for one religion over another and there should be no display of any symbol - crucifix , head scarf or turban .
john , france of course it will inflame tensions between faiths .
italy is , and has within it , the centre of the catholic faith .
to coin a phrase " when in rome ! "
les woods , england / uk religion should be in schools only as part of history or psychology , studied with myths , legends , fairytales and superstitions .
nigel rees , uk / usa it will inflame tensions - europe has been christian for thousands of years and many will see this as foreigners removing our heritage .
tom , england a complete ban on all religious symbols on the walls of schools could be put in place to " show the unequivocal desire by the state ... to place atheism at the centre of the universe " .
whatever is done will be wrong .
as for inflaming tensions between religions , the whole effect of serious and committed religious belief is to preclude tolerance of others .
no religion has ever accepted that others have a right to exist let alone that they might also be correct in their beliefs .
after all their ' holy book ' proves that they are right .

a court decision to order a state kindergarten to remove crucifixes from its classrooms has caused controversy in italy .
the ruling by a judge in the central town of l 'aquila , following a complaint by an italian muslim leader , has re-opened a bitter debate about religious symbols .
the judge ruled that crucifixes on classroom walls showed " the unequivocal desire by the state , when it comes to public education , to place the catholic religion at the centre of the universe " , disregarding other religions .
do you agree with the decision ?
or could it inflame tensions between faiths ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think there should be no crucifixes in the classrooms .
its no problem for me that children learn about the christian religion but if so then why not to learn about all religions .
they should know other point of views to become more tolerant and to retard conflicts .
i grew up in poland with the crucifixes in the classrooms but now i live in germany .
i was told in the school to love all human beings but on the other hand i heard that the other religions are dangerous .
generally each religion can be dangerous .
bozena , germany crosses bearing idols of jesus breach the first commandment as does worship of jesus ' mother and should be banned everywhere .
as a christian i wear an empty cross to remind me there is no death , that i am free and i have promised to treat others as i would like to be treated .
all symbols are personal and should not be backed by government organisations , especially schools .
jesus directed we pray at home , in privacy .
if all followed his advice , there would be no churches with their power to exert power , gather wealth and manipulate gullible and superstitious people .
lionel hurst , australia this is clearly a problem of intolerance of the host country by an outsider , mr smith the muslim leader has also called for the removal of a 15th century christian fresco in bologna cathedral on the grounds that it shows the prophet mohammed this man is absolutely determined to ignore the fact that as a immigrant he should respect the culture and customs of his new adopted land .
yan michek , switzerland the cross simply says , " truth will set you free . "
it is thus the perfect symbol for what we call an education .
it shows us the cosmic relationship between truth and sacrifice .
but it is more that just a symbol .
it is a guide that helps us find meaning in notions like equality , democracy , love and it beckons us to love our neighbours as one .
it is a guide to peace .
who would dare take it down ?
taeho paik , italy why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- as an italian i 'm very happy about the judge 's decision , it 's about time the crucifixes get removed from state schools , and i know many other italians who think the same .
it 's only unfortunate the case was brought up by a muslim because this gives crucifix supporters an easy excuse to blame " foreigners " for destroying italy 's culture .
this has nothing to do with culture , as a non religious italian i demand crucifixes to be removed from any state building too , they belong in churches !
why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion that is loosing support fast in italy anyway ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- yes !
they should be banned in all ' state ' schools and establishments .
in a ' religious ' school of whatever faith , and where there are clear alternative schools where pupils can be sent , then they should be allowed .
this gives the choice of ' education and indoctrination ' to the parents of the pupils .
' religion ' should also be taken out of any school curricula .
if any parent wants their offspring to be educated in a ' religious ' way then let them go to the nearest appropriate religious establishment , be it a christian on or for any other religion .
b w moore , ne uk i think that everyone is missing the real reason behind the banning of the crucifix .
islam , judaism and christianity -lrb- in its true aramaic form -rrb- strictly forbid the use of idols , pictures etc depicting what prophets looked like .
this is primarily to stop the practice of idol worship which many modern day christians are accustomed to .
the crucifix in the past has been used as a tool by the missionaries to ' tame the savages ' into believing that jesus christ -lrb- peace be upon him -rrb- was a blonde-haired , blue-eyed european rather than a palestinian .
muslims are opposed to the depiction of the prophet jesus in this way .
they are not opposed to the fact that they are being misrepresented in the classroom !
e malik , uk as a roman catholic , i am shocked that one guy can change thousands of years of tradition .
italia is a catholic country and the cross is part of italia 's culture ... if mr. smith does n't like to raise his children in a place where catholics and catholic symbols are predominant , then he needs to pick up and move to saudi arabia or albania ... does it bother mr. smith that his children see the crosses on top of all the great churches of italy ?
should we remove all crosses and church towers around the catholic world , or should we just put a muslim symbol on top of each tower next to the cross to make it to his liking ?
should we not offer pork in our stores , because muslims do n't want to see it ?
marko latinovic , mostar , bosnia-herzegovina i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland in poland there are at least 95 % classrooms with crosses .
it is really funny and ironic .
people do n't care about them .
they should be removed as should be removed " religion " lesson - and moved to the church !
we 've got to learn about other religions too , how to live and understand others .
i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland italy 's constitution promises freedom of religion , just as most modern western constitutions do .
religious symbols are not appropriate in government schools .
christopher c. tew , usa groups come in and want to take over and change centuries of tradition and culture with one shout of discrimination .
if you choose to go to another country with a different culture and religion , it is the immigrant who has the responsibility for adapting , not the society itself .
gianna , usa i find it extremely depressing to see that , again , the wishes of a few surpass the wishes of the many .
culture and heritage are being erased in order to avoid offending the intolerant .
shannon simons , usa it 's common for christians to feel that this is an act against them , but so would the placing of other religion 's symbols next to their own .
the use of the crucifix to me is seems a bit like idol worship .
my relationship with god is not governed by having pictures laying around , but by the conversations we have .
wwill foster , usa the only option is to keep the state totally secular paul qureshi , uk if religious symbols are to be endorsed by the state and placed in classrooms , then all religions must be represented .
this raises two issues .
firstly , what constitutes a religion ?
many people put " jedi " on their census form , would that mean a light-sabre has to be on the wall too ?
secondly , many people would object to , say , satanist symbols , but they too would have to be displayed .
clearly , the only option is to keep the state and all state operated organisations totally secular .
this does not prevent anyone practicing their religion , nor force religion on them .
paul qureshi , uk like the old saying goes , " when in rome , do as the romans do . "
obviously , the muslim leader has never heard this before and does not understand the wisdom behind accepting the cultural aspect of one 's adopted country .
anthony , usa do n't forget that this man went to court when the school refused to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix in his children 's classroom .
so who is being intolerant here ?
if you 're for freedom of religion , let all religions have freedom .
if you 're for secularism , then ban all religious symbols .
people should n't use this issue to unfairly attack muslims yet again when it 's clear that the intolerance stems from others .
bilal patel , london , uk i am not very passionate about religion and this issue .
however , perhaps a better option would be to add some symbols of other religions and so to acknowledge and invite their contribution to national / local culture rather than pretending none of them counts or exists .
dariusz , poland but i would question why anyone would find this offensive jim , nj , usa the decision is technically correct because true democracies must be secular .
but i would question why anyone would find this offensive .
christ is n't going to jump off that cross and start converting children of other faiths by force .
the fact that the plaintiff originally wanted another religious symbol added , rather than the removal of the crucifix , proves he was not motivated by democratic ideals .
this is a case of a harmless tradition taken away for childish motives - " if i ca n't have my way , you ca n't have yours either " .
jim , nj , usa yes .
i agree with the ruling .
christians need to realize that they are just one religion with no more authenticity than any other .
tom cunningham , usa if you go to the beach , the wear a swimsuit .
if you 're going to a board meeting , you wear a three-piece suit .
if you going to school , you 're going to study math , literature , biology , and if you want to read the bible , koran , torah or whatever and pray and all that stuff , you go to church , which is where the cross belongs .
it 's very logical , very simple , and the rule of law .
a swimsuit would be out of place in the board room as would a three-piece suit at the beach .
can the cross - it 's out of place , and get over it .
let 's get on with education our young .
bobbi roman , usa what happens to christian residents in muslim countries ?
does any muslim judge dare to ban the half moon or whatever from classrooms in respect of christians ? ? ?
guests must respect the country in which they are hosted , its law and its traditions too .
host countries must surely respect their guests but must respect first their traditions and their native people .
fabio , italy children should not be indoctrinated with religion .
there is enough time when they are adults and more knowledgeable for them to decide if they want to join a religious group .
in the meantime , let us keep any kind of religious symbols out of the classrooms of public schools .
nyakairu , novi , usa like it or not , europe is the main place where christianity grew , in the same way the middle east and asia is where islam grew .
hence a lot of christian symbols here and a lot of islamic symbols in the middle east etc .
some largely muslim countries have crescents on their flags in the same way crosses often appear on european flags .
what we need is mutual respect which means muslims must respect our faith , culture and history in the same way they want us to respect theirs .
the judge 's decision was wrong because it will only cause resentment not respect .
fabian , uk by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed jose nigrin , guatemala when any country has a national recognized religion , the result will be the creation of second class citizens , that do n't profess this religion , and suffer discrimination in jobs , education , and opportunities for improvements .
by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed in favour of the main official credo .
jose nigrin , guatemala in public schools absolutely .
in religious ones , no problem .
leduc jean-francois , bangkok thailand what business does a crucifix have in a classroom to begin with ?
if you want to teach your children about a religion , go for it ; however that has nothing to do with public schooling .
if i were a school teacher and decided that i would like to have a statue of ganesh , i think i might get a little flack about it , so why should a crucifix be allowed ?
mike , usa as long as the teacher does not try to convert the children to a particular faith , we should not take away the right to free speech and beliefs .
gareth giles , england i think the cross should have stayed on the wall .
i would suggest , if the man disagrees with the symbol as much as that , then he take his children to a kindergarten that does not outwardly show it 's moral standpoint and not enforce oppression upon the other 99 % of class attendees callum w , uk many contributors are missing the point .
italy is a secular state , therefore the separation of state and religion -lrb- unlike the majority of muslim countries that profess nothing of the sort - the comparative argument thus being moot -rrb- .
the kindergarten being state run had no authority to place a catholic religious symbol in classrooms to the exclusion of all other religions .
the court 's decision was not only fair but based on the rule of law .
people who think otherwise are feeding the debate and controversy regarding islam and the west .
what they should remember is that the crux of all major world religions is tolerance .
h. schmitt , germany not banned nor compulsory .
states should not rule on religion .
people must be free to choose their faith and symbols .
ricardo , brazil the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions arif , england as muslim child i went to a church of england primary school , as did all my siblings .
we even went to church on numerous occasions with school !
in no way did this affect my religious identity or my faith .
all my family are devout muslims .
we never had any problems with the symbols of christianity that we visible in school .
the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions .
rather than removing symbols of christianity , symbols of other religions should be allowed in schools , so that we can celebrate or differences in a spirit of understanding , mutual respect and tolerance .
arif , england if the crucifix was on the wall of a catholic or christian school then what is the problem ?
if the muslim leader is in such a school and being in a predominantly christian country surely he must respect the local customs and cultures as he would expect anyone else to if they were in a muslim country , as others have said " when in rome etc . "
vivienne , uk a crucifix is a reminder that jesus the son of god died for our sins .
this is valid for moslems , jews , christians and atheists alike , even though some may not want to accept this truth .
aj , germany why should we remove the symbols of our faiths ?
i follow no religious order but i respect the views of people who do , if we went to muslim countries and started demanding they stop / remove items of their faith , we would be thrown out , this is pc gone mad , next thing on the hit list will be stopping xmas / easter etc .
and people wonder why extreme political parties are gaining ground , why does no one listen ?
j mulligan , uk how are children expected to learn about religion , if we keep banning it ?
surely this teaches intolerance !
susan , uk as dominant as christianity is in italy , the crucifix symbolizes centuries of oppression to those not of the faith .
the current saudi style of religious intolerance is no more extreme , or irrational , than that practiced by vatican inspired governments .
what islamic , jewish , hindi , wiccan , agnostic or atheistic child or adult benefits from the singular presence of a religious symbol in a secular learning environment ?
can the cross ?
amen !
ralph , usa it should be only displayed in religious schools manuel , macedonia the crucifix -lrb- which is , either you like it or not , a somewhat morbid symbol with jesus nailed on the cross , bleeding to death -rrb- and portrays the catholic religion with all the respect that it deserves , like any other religion .
therefore it should be only displayed in religious schools .
likewise , islam should abstain to portray religious symbols in non-religious schools .
islam should also refrain from getting into squabbling over religious issues as it will only lead to a growing divide between the west and muslim countries .
it is shameful that both religions fight over spirituality and the same god , despite the way he is perceived and loved by each other .
manuel , macedonia what 's next - banning christmas trees , carol singers and easter eggs ... they are all symbols of christian festivals ...
lisa , italy we think that it could be a good decision , because many and many italian do n't believe in god , especially young people and the school is lay and everyone could believe in what he or she wants .
anyway if someone wants a crucifix in his classroom , he has to allow everyone to put on the walls his own idols .
however we have to identify this case like a case of destroy the catholic religion at the base .
giovanni & riki , italy in our opinion , the cross is a religious symbol so it has n't to be on school 's walls because the school is lay institution .
so putting away from school 's walls the cross is right also because italy is a democratic country and it should n't impose its religion .
we 're christians so we believe in god but we think that the school is n't the place to show our religion because there are others buildings for this -lrb- churches -rrb- !
that 's all !
pamela & roberta , italy the crucifix is intrinsic to history anna , usa lately it seems we are bothered when there are mixed displays of sentiment and opinion .
the crucifix is intrinsic to history .
it is a monument of a culture and a movement and though you may not personally prescribe to it , it is still an integral part of the societies of today .
should we forget history because it bothers us ?
anna , usa faith / religion must be placed in the classroom .
it 's ignorant to deny its role in history , politics , culture ... and the day-to-day life of italy .
it 's bigoted to deny any metaphysical dimension to the world .
however , as a christian , i aint impressed with suppression of other religious views .
' elites ' set themselves up as religions ; but goodness knows what mr. keesee is banging on about : the eu ... international socialism . yeah right .
international capitalism more like !
you should pray for socialism if you care for god 's world .
andrew falconer , uk i agree .
religious symbols should be removed from any place of veneration in a secular school system .
larry , usa if italy truly has laws that apply to this situation , then i do n't have a problem with the ruling .
what i find sad though is that all this talk of multi-culturalism is really leading us to no-culturalism .
if everything that any one person disagrees with are banned , it will be a very boring world indeed that we leave to our children .
gary patterson , usa the cross should stay , when in rome do as the roman 's do .
n gorton , uk expat / canada why should n't there be religious symbols in schools ?
religions are part of human history .
religions are the base of the different cultures .
there is a lot of wisdom in all the different religions .
i think teaching about religions should be compulsory .
it is ignorance that creates intolerance , not knowledge .
harriet , singapore / nl it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around edwin thornber , uk / romania let muslim countries ban their religious symbols in their own countries before complaining about religious symbols in other countries .
it is surely a bit like complaining that italians speak italian .
it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around .
may be islam should be banned .
edwin thornber , uk / romania since christianity lies at the very foundation of european civilisation , history and law - and most especially italy 's - it is perfectly acceptable to have christian symbols in places where children are educated .
when we abandon the principles of christianity in order to please those of other faiths we tread a dangerous path .
dorothy , belgium i am an italian boy and my point of view is all religious symbols should be kept out from public schools and courts .
all religions must be respect each other , and one day we 'll live in a multi-cultural society .
italo p. , ripatransone italy i find it scary that signs of some religious affiliations are being banned , but others are somehow protected .
why is it ok to wear a headscarf , but not ok to wear a cross ?
why can children in the us swear and threaten their teachers in the name of free speech , but they can not pray in school ?
we have effectively removed god -lrb- by any name or form -rrb- from the public life in the us , now we wonder why our children lack direction and honour ?
sandra , us separating religion and state should be a must in all countries stefan , europe separating religion and state should be a must in all countries .
this means removing religious icons from classrooms , courthouses and other public places .
however there should also be freedom of religion .
this means that individuals should be allowed to wear a cross or a headscarf even in school or at work , individuals not government paid institutions should have the choice whether or not to display their religion publicly .
another option would be that public institutions should allow individuals to request their own religious symbol to be added if one of another religion is already present .
this might even help boost the tolerance between religions .
stefan , europe as an atheist i find all religious symbols to be at worst offensive and at best , irrelevant .
i would rather my children not have to observe these blinkered symbols of spiritual oppression , whichever of the main faiths they come from , they have no place in schools although nor does prayer or any other type of faith based activity .
john keegans , nottingham , uk this issue is primarily one of national sovereignty , as far as i am concerned .
there is clearly a general consensus and a deep-rooted tradition among the italians to display the crucifix symbol .
italy is not bound by the formal law in france of 1905 entirely separating religion and state , nor should it be made to bow to the whims of the eurocrats in brussels .
the way things are going , one day the flags of england , the uk , the scandinavian countries , and greece may be forced to remove their cross symbols on the grounds that they portray religious exclusivity .
jacob , uk those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue sean , belgium i could not imagine jesus christ or mohammed arguing over these symbols .
all parties involved have missed the point .
those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue .
the right to have the symbol is as strong as the right to remove the symbol .
let the children decide !
sean , belgium is italy not a predominantly catholic country ?
could a christian go to a muslim country and demand that they remove all islamic symbols ?
i think not .
if a muslim wants to reside in a christian country they have to tolerate the religion .
unlike in muslim countries where it is a crime to display crucifixes and possess bibles .
i can not believe the stupidity of the italian judge .
shame on him .
ben aldorino , uk i fail to see how the banning of religious symbols sends a message of multiculturalism and tolerance .
schools should encourage discussion about different religion and cultures because , far from being irrelevant , it seems to be increasingly relevant in the age we are living in .
helen , uk having lived and worked in saudi arabia for 11 years where you ca n't even wear a crucifix on a chain round you neck , take a bible into the kingdom , hold any kind of religious service , or even enter the city of mecca .
where they even stopped swiss air from flying into the kingdom because there plane had a red cross on the tailplane .
all i can say to this muslim leader in italy is " when in rome do as the romans do " and think him self lucky he has some where to go and pray in italy , because in arabia catholics and christians do n't .
r.l.tasker roger tasker , italy why should crosses or any religious symbols be removed ?
if we want a free , tolerant and open minded society , i see no reason why religious symbols should be banned .
i think the decision shows a lack of maturity - just another sign of cultural sanitisation .
js , norwich , uk it is strange that one insists that a cross be removed from a classroom and another is permitted a headscarf in the classroom .
looks like some have their cake and get to eat it .
doug , sweden such traditions are difficult to change , but the value of having a genuinely secular state is now known to be strongly positive .
the change is correct .
cliff , usa the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision raimundo l. santos , brazil the crucifix is an important symbol for christians .
as a catholic i do n't see any point in removing our christian symbols for fear any other religion would not like or approve of it .
if i were living in a muslim country for example , i would n't feel scandalized just to see women in their burkas and veils , or men wearing their turbans .
moreover , i suppose " judges " or the like in muslim countries are not really concerned if we christians approve or disapprove of their habits and customs , so why should we ?
the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision , which might as well offend catholics .
raimundo l. santos , brazil if italy 's present laws do , at least on paper , separate the church from the state , then it definitely should have been removed .
i 'm actually surprised this is getting so much attention - while living in italy , going to church in italy , i found most italians did n't regularly attend church .
as for christians in muslim countries , mentioned below - perhaps that 's why these muslims do not live in said countries ?
christina , usa the eu elites see religion as an obstacle not an asset .
the catholic church is a symbol of italy as is the lutheran church in germany and the anglican church in britain and the orthodox churches in eastern europe .
the euro elites want people from sicily to scandinavia to bow to them .
eliminating the religions that are associated with nations and replacing it with their rootless worship of international socialism then the eu elites can further their agenda against national sovereignty .
colin keesee , usa it 's a shame that no mention was made that the muslim man had requested an islamic symbol be represented along side the crucifix .
i 'm not sure i agree with going to court over such an issue when clearly in a country that is predominantly christian .
however , i believe that religious symbols should be removed and teaching kids about different faiths and religions is important to bridge the gap of ignorance between us all .
zak , uk in any country that went through the reformation this would be a non-issue .
but this is italy : the church still plays a massive role in the country 's political life and people 's mind set is not ready yet to deal with a society that only recently has started to become relatively multicultural .
religion should stay out of the classroom .
matteo garavoglia , italy , eu interestingly , many of the non-religious contributors seem to be as , or more , intolerant of religious expression than the religions they view with disdain as intolerant !
mark , scotland a crucifix in the classroom is the tip of the iceberg in italy vanessa , uk / italy unfortunately italy has the vatican within its borders , all the political parties try to seek favour with the catholic faith , see the recent debacle on the proposed law for a quick divorce .
i would ban crucifix not only in the schools , but in the courts -lrb- yes , they are present there too -rrb- .
i would ban the religious lessons in schools , taught by teachers that the bishop chooses , not the state education .
a crucifix in the class room is the tip of the iceberg in italy , the church interferes everywhere , unfortunately an , in my view , unpleasant man like smith has started this debate that has been long overdue .
vanessa , uk / italy the crucifix is as much a cultural symbol as a religious one .
it represents centuries of european civilisation and should not be lightly discarded .
richard cotton , london , uk the problem of separation of ' religion in schools ' would go away if the government followed the bastiat principle of limiting the law to its task and letting private institutions educate and provide services .
then the private institutions could be religious or a-religious and it would be fine .
ewan , uk it seems reasonable to remove the crucifix from the classroom if it affects the sentiments of people in the community .
however by taking out a so-called religious symbol , are we not endorsing another symbol ?
let 's just remember that having ' no symbols ' is not fair to all .
it is still subscribing to a particular view .
neil , india in the new europe whose culture is becoming dominated by -lrb- or reduced to -rrb- shopping centres , clearly the elite find the catholic church to be an obstacle to be suppressed .
clearly it is disadvantageous if people have things on their minds other than consumption .
the muslim minority is essentially a tool in the hands of the euro-buros in this case in the suppression of traditions that do not suit their taste .
balazs , italy all this fuss over religion - what about the kids ?
in schools they should be " educated " to be tolerant and loving !
plaster casts on walls or symbols of this or that are irrelevant .
it 's what 's taught them about love and international caring that matters - otherwise shut the schools !
stephen , thailand religious symbols should never be displayed in schools ... especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others keith , canada i believed italians were smart and educated - how can they allow such nonsense in a classroom and mislead their children ?
religion should be a personal matter and it should never be symbolised in a place where there are people of mixed or no faith .
amjad farooq , us i do not tend to agree with the judge 's decision .
if the other religion 's leader is not happy with the crucifix because this may influence muslim children in my opinion it would be more prudent if he asked to fix a muslim symbol on the walls near the catholic symbol .
alfred mallia , malta i think the separation of church and state is so heavily enforced in the west that in a way it actually promotes atheism .
i would prefer the way we handle this in bangladesh .
we are a multi-religious country where most of the major religions in the nation are recognised .
if i 'm not mistaken , the muslim leader initially asked for the school to put a muslim symbol beside the cross in the classroom , but the school refused .
i therefore support the judge 's decision to hold every religion with equal respect .
arif joarder , bangladesh religion should stay out of the classroom , period kent , canada it 's unfair that the initial suggestion by adel smith to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix should have been denied .
therefore it 's only fair that the crucifix be removed altogether to avoid creating a kind of religious superiority which is totally out of place in a multi-racial society .
patricia , italy it will inflame tensions between faiths , but i think it is a fair ruling as long all faiths are respected rodrigo , paraguay religious symbols have no place in a classroom .
religion is undoubtedly a private matter and should be kept so in the future .
neil jones , united kingdom religion should stay out of the classroom , period .
kent , canada italy was born -lrb- less than 150 years ago -rrb- when the laws of piedmont -lrb- a secular country -rrb- were extended to italy at unification .
italy stayed secular until fascism , when mussolini bought the support of the catholic church by turning back the clock on separation between religion and state .
hence the recent court judgment is in line with italy 's history and gives back to the italians the secular state that is part of their democratic traditions .
silvio sandrone , turin , piedmont -lrb- italy -rrb- muslims want to have religious rights in christian countries , do they grant the same rights to christians in muslim countries ?
adam schott , australia i strongly agree with the judge 's decision .
a fascist state was responsible for the current law .
this issue is a no-brainer and the vatican must be stopped from imposing its agenda on people who do not subscribe to it .
richard , us here in italy , we have one hour a week of confessional catholic teaching in every school .
if you do n't like that you have to opt-out .
in my opinion , that 's the problem , not the crucifix .
paolo , italy religious symbols should never be displayed in schools .
and especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others .
keith , canada in state schools there is no place for one religion over another john , france i do n't mind religious symbols in public -lrb- as art -rrb- .
however , as children are so susceptible to the ideas of others above their own , it seems inappropriate for public school to " endorse " any religion .
if children wish to express themselves -lrb- wearing crosses , headscarves -rrb- , this seems innocent .
it is the expression of the child and his or her family , rather than the state communicating a preference to the children .
aleta , united states i ca n't accept that a judge is trying to erase a part of our culture and history with a sentence .
and i ca n't accept that this request comes from a man who believes to be the head of italian muslims and who has always talked so badly of the catholic religion .
and so why do n't we sweep off the red cross symbol ?
michele , italy as a christian i strongly believe that the church and state must be kept separate and state must not and should not support or favour or endorse any one religion as this is a step toward state control of freedom .
crosses i feel are fine in home or in a local church but not in government-run institutions .
mark flanagan , sweden i ca n't help thinking that if it had been the opposite and a catholic had sought the removal of islamic symbols , they would have been slammed for being racist .
once again national culture and history are sacrificed on the altar of political correctness .
dean , uk all religious symbols should -lrb- must -rrb- be removed from public places and public use .
they should be allowed in places of worship of the particular religion / belief or in any individual 's home .
public no , schools no .
miklos nomad , hungary in state schools there is no place for one religion over another and there should be no display of any symbol - crucifix , head scarf or turban .
john , france of course it will inflame tensions between faiths .
italy is , and has within it , the centre of the catholic faith .
to coin a phrase " when in rome ! "
les woods , england / uk religion should be in schools only as part of history or psychology , studied with myths , legends , fairytales and superstitions .
nigel rees , uk / usa it will inflame tensions - europe has been christian for thousands of years and many will see this as foreigners removing our heritage .
tom , england a complete ban on all religious symbols on the walls of schools could be put in place to " show the unequivocal desire by the state ... to place atheism at the centre of the universe " .
whatever is done will be wrong .
as for inflaming tensions between religions , the whole effect of serious and committed religious belief is to preclude tolerance of others .
no religion has ever accepted that others have a right to exist let alone that they might also be correct in their beliefs .
after all their ' holy book ' proves that they are right .

a court decision to order a state kindergarten to remove crucifixes from its classrooms has caused controversy in italy .
the ruling by a judge in the central town of l 'aquila , following a complaint by an italian muslim leader , has re-opened a bitter debate about religious symbols .
the judge ruled that crucifixes on classroom walls showed " the unequivocal desire by the state , when it comes to public education , to place the catholic religion at the centre of the universe " , disregarding other religions .
do you agree with the decision ?
or could it inflame tensions between faiths ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think there should be no crucifixes in the classrooms .
its no problem for me that children learn about the christian religion but if so then why not to learn about all religions .
they should know other point of views to become more tolerant and to retard conflicts .
i grew up in poland with the crucifixes in the classrooms but now i live in germany .
i was told in the school to love all human beings but on the other hand i heard that the other religions are dangerous .
generally each religion can be dangerous .
bozena , germany crosses bearing idols of jesus breach the first commandment as does worship of jesus ' mother and should be banned everywhere .
as a christian i wear an empty cross to remind me there is no death , that i am free and i have promised to treat others as i would like to be treated .
all symbols are personal and should not be backed by government organisations , especially schools .
jesus directed we pray at home , in privacy .
if all followed his advice , there would be no churches with their power to exert power , gather wealth and manipulate gullible and superstitious people .
lionel hurst , australia this is clearly a problem of intolerance of the host country by an outsider , mr smith the muslim leader has also called for the removal of a 15th century christian fresco in bologna cathedral on the grounds that it shows the prophet mohammed this man is absolutely determined to ignore the fact that as a immigrant he should respect the culture and customs of his new adopted land .
yan michek , switzerland the cross simply says , " truth will set you free . "
it is thus the perfect symbol for what we call an education .
it shows us the cosmic relationship between truth and sacrifice .
but it is more that just a symbol .
it is a guide that helps us find meaning in notions like equality , democracy , love and it beckons us to love our neighbours as one .
it is a guide to peace .
who would dare take it down ?
taeho paik , italy why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- as an italian i 'm very happy about the judge 's decision , it 's about time the crucifixes get removed from state schools , and i know many other italians who think the same .
it 's only unfortunate the case was brought up by a muslim because this gives crucifix supporters an easy excuse to blame " foreigners " for destroying italy 's culture .
this has nothing to do with culture , as a non religious italian i demand crucifixes to be removed from any state building too , they belong in churches !
why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion that is loosing support fast in italy anyway ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- yes !
they should be banned in all ' state ' schools and establishments .
in a ' religious ' school of whatever faith , and where there are clear alternative schools where pupils can be sent , then they should be allowed .
this gives the choice of ' education and indoctrination ' to the parents of the pupils .
' religion ' should also be taken out of any school curricula .
if any parent wants their offspring to be educated in a ' religious ' way then let them go to the nearest appropriate religious establishment , be it a christian on or for any other religion .
b w moore , ne uk i think that everyone is missing the real reason behind the banning of the crucifix .
islam , judaism and christianity -lrb- in its true aramaic form -rrb- strictly forbid the use of idols , pictures etc depicting what prophets looked like .
this is primarily to stop the practice of idol worship which many modern day christians are accustomed to .
the crucifix in the past has been used as a tool by the missionaries to ' tame the savages ' into believing that jesus christ -lrb- peace be upon him -rrb- was a blonde-haired , blue-eyed european rather than a palestinian .
muslims are opposed to the depiction of the prophet jesus in this way .
they are not opposed to the fact that they are being misrepresented in the classroom !
e malik , uk as a roman catholic , i am shocked that one guy can change thousands of years of tradition .
italia is a catholic country and the cross is part of italia 's culture ... if mr. smith does n't like to raise his children in a place where catholics and catholic symbols are predominant , then he needs to pick up and move to saudi arabia or albania ... does it bother mr. smith that his children see the crosses on top of all the great churches of italy ?
should we remove all crosses and church towers around the catholic world , or should we just put a muslim symbol on top of each tower next to the cross to make it to his liking ?
should we not offer pork in our stores , because muslims do n't want to see it ?
marko latinovic , mostar , bosnia-herzegovina i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland in poland there are at least 95 % classrooms with crosses .
it is really funny and ironic .
people do n't care about them .
they should be removed as should be removed " religion " lesson - and moved to the church !
we 've got to learn about other religions too , how to live and understand others .
i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland italy 's constitution promises freedom of religion , just as most modern western constitutions do .
religious symbols are not appropriate in government schools .
christopher c. tew , usa groups come in and want to take over and change centuries of tradition and culture with one shout of discrimination .
if you choose to go to another country with a different culture and religion , it is the immigrant who has the responsibility for adapting , not the society itself .
gianna , usa i find it extremely depressing to see that , again , the wishes of a few surpass the wishes of the many .
culture and heritage are being erased in order to avoid offending the intolerant .
shannon simons , usa it 's common for christians to feel that this is an act against them , but so would the placing of other religion 's symbols next to their own .
the use of the crucifix to me is seems a bit like idol worship .
my relationship with god is not governed by having pictures laying around , but by the conversations we have .
wwill foster , usa the only option is to keep the state totally secular paul qureshi , uk if religious symbols are to be endorsed by the state and placed in classrooms , then all religions must be represented .
this raises two issues .
firstly , what constitutes a religion ?
many people put " jedi " on their census form , would that mean a light-sabre has to be on the wall too ?
secondly , many people would object to , say , satanist symbols , but they too would have to be displayed .
clearly , the only option is to keep the state and all state operated organisations totally secular .
this does not prevent anyone practicing their religion , nor force religion on them .
paul qureshi , uk like the old saying goes , " when in rome , do as the romans do . "
obviously , the muslim leader has never heard this before and does not understand the wisdom behind accepting the cultural aspect of one 's adopted country .
anthony , usa do n't forget that this man went to court when the school refused to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix in his children 's classroom .
so who is being intolerant here ?
if you 're for freedom of religion , let all religions have freedom .
if you 're for secularism , then ban all religious symbols .
people should n't use this issue to unfairly attack muslims yet again when it 's clear that the intolerance stems from others .
bilal patel , london , uk i am not very passionate about religion and this issue .
however , perhaps a better option would be to add some symbols of other religions and so to acknowledge and invite their contribution to national / local culture rather than pretending none of them counts or exists .
dariusz , poland but i would question why anyone would find this offensive jim , nj , usa the decision is technically correct because true democracies must be secular .
but i would question why anyone would find this offensive .
christ is n't going to jump off that cross and start converting children of other faiths by force .
the fact that the plaintiff originally wanted another religious symbol added , rather than the removal of the crucifix , proves he was not motivated by democratic ideals .
this is a case of a harmless tradition taken away for childish motives - " if i ca n't have my way , you ca n't have yours either " .
jim , nj , usa yes .
i agree with the ruling .
christians need to realize that they are just one religion with no more authenticity than any other .
tom cunningham , usa if you go to the beach , the wear a swimsuit .
if you 're going to a board meeting , you wear a three-piece suit .
if you going to school , you 're going to study math , literature , biology , and if you want to read the bible , koran , torah or whatever and pray and all that stuff , you go to church , which is where the cross belongs .
it 's very logical , very simple , and the rule of law .
a swimsuit would be out of place in the board room as would a three-piece suit at the beach .
can the cross - it 's out of place , and get over it .
let 's get on with education our young .
bobbi roman , usa what happens to christian residents in muslim countries ?
does any muslim judge dare to ban the half moon or whatever from classrooms in respect of christians ? ? ?
guests must respect the country in which they are hosted , its law and its traditions too .
host countries must surely respect their guests but must respect first their traditions and their native people .
fabio , italy children should not be indoctrinated with religion .
there is enough time when they are adults and more knowledgeable for them to decide if they want to join a religious group .
in the meantime , let us keep any kind of religious symbols out of the classrooms of public schools .
nyakairu , novi , usa like it or not , europe is the main place where christianity grew , in the same way the middle east and asia is where islam grew .
hence a lot of christian symbols here and a lot of islamic symbols in the middle east etc .
some largely muslim countries have crescents on their flags in the same way crosses often appear on european flags .
what we need is mutual respect which means muslims must respect our faith , culture and history in the same way they want us to respect theirs .
the judge 's decision was wrong because it will only cause resentment not respect .
fabian , uk by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed jose nigrin , guatemala when any country has a national recognized religion , the result will be the creation of second class citizens , that do n't profess this religion , and suffer discrimination in jobs , education , and opportunities for improvements .
by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed in favour of the main official credo .
jose nigrin , guatemala in public schools absolutely .
in religious ones , no problem .
leduc jean-francois , bangkok thailand what business does a crucifix have in a classroom to begin with ?
if you want to teach your children about a religion , go for it ; however that has nothing to do with public schooling .
if i were a school teacher and decided that i would like to have a statue of ganesh , i think i might get a little flack about it , so why should a crucifix be allowed ?
mike , usa as long as the teacher does not try to convert the children to a particular faith , we should not take away the right to free speech and beliefs .
gareth giles , england i think the cross should have stayed on the wall .
i would suggest , if the man disagrees with the symbol as much as that , then he take his children to a kindergarten that does not outwardly show it 's moral standpoint and not enforce oppression upon the other 99 % of class attendees callum w , uk many contributors are missing the point .
italy is a secular state , therefore the separation of state and religion -lrb- unlike the majority of muslim countries that profess nothing of the sort - the comparative argument thus being moot -rrb- .
the kindergarten being state run had no authority to place a catholic religious symbol in classrooms to the exclusion of all other religions .
the court 's decision was not only fair but based on the rule of law .
people who think otherwise are feeding the debate and controversy regarding islam and the west .
what they should remember is that the crux of all major world religions is tolerance .
h. schmitt , germany not banned nor compulsory .
states should not rule on religion .
people must be free to choose their faith and symbols .
ricardo , brazil the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions arif , england as muslim child i went to a church of england primary school , as did all my siblings .
we even went to church on numerous occasions with school !
in no way did this affect my religious identity or my faith .
all my family are devout muslims .
we never had any problems with the symbols of christianity that we visible in school .
the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions .
rather than removing symbols of christianity , symbols of other religions should be allowed in schools , so that we can celebrate or differences in a spirit of understanding , mutual respect and tolerance .
arif , england if the crucifix was on the wall of a catholic or christian school then what is the problem ?
if the muslim leader is in such a school and being in a predominantly christian country surely he must respect the local customs and cultures as he would expect anyone else to if they were in a muslim country , as others have said " when in rome etc . "
vivienne , uk a crucifix is a reminder that jesus the son of god died for our sins .
this is valid for moslems , jews , christians and atheists alike , even though some may not want to accept this truth .
aj , germany why should we remove the symbols of our faiths ?
i follow no religious order but i respect the views of people who do , if we went to muslim countries and started demanding they stop / remove items of their faith , we would be thrown out , this is pc gone mad , next thing on the hit list will be stopping xmas / easter etc .
and people wonder why extreme political parties are gaining ground , why does no one listen ?
j mulligan , uk how are children expected to learn about religion , if we keep banning it ?
surely this teaches intolerance !
susan , uk as dominant as christianity is in italy , the crucifix symbolizes centuries of oppression to those not of the faith .
the current saudi style of religious intolerance is no more extreme , or irrational , than that practiced by vatican inspired governments .
what islamic , jewish , hindi , wiccan , agnostic or atheistic child or adult benefits from the singular presence of a religious symbol in a secular learning environment ?
can the cross ?
amen !
ralph , usa it should be only displayed in religious schools manuel , macedonia the crucifix -lrb- which is , either you like it or not , a somewhat morbid symbol with jesus nailed on the cross , bleeding to death -rrb- and portrays the catholic religion with all the respect that it deserves , like any other religion .
therefore it should be only displayed in religious schools .
likewise , islam should abstain to portray religious symbols in non-religious schools .
islam should also refrain from getting into squabbling over religious issues as it will only lead to a growing divide between the west and muslim countries .
it is shameful that both religions fight over spirituality and the same god , despite the way he is perceived and loved by each other .
manuel , macedonia what 's next - banning christmas trees , carol singers and easter eggs ... they are all symbols of christian festivals ...
lisa , italy we think that it could be a good decision , because many and many italian do n't believe in god , especially young people and the school is lay and everyone could believe in what he or she wants .
anyway if someone wants a crucifix in his classroom , he has to allow everyone to put on the walls his own idols .
however we have to identify this case like a case of destroy the catholic religion at the base .
giovanni & riki , italy in our opinion , the cross is a religious symbol so it has n't to be on school 's walls because the school is lay institution .
so putting away from school 's walls the cross is right also because italy is a democratic country and it should n't impose its religion .
we 're christians so we believe in god but we think that the school is n't the place to show our religion because there are others buildings for this -lrb- churches -rrb- !
that 's all !
pamela & roberta , italy the crucifix is intrinsic to history anna , usa lately it seems we are bothered when there are mixed displays of sentiment and opinion .
the crucifix is intrinsic to history .
it is a monument of a culture and a movement and though you may not personally prescribe to it , it is still an integral part of the societies of today .
should we forget history because it bothers us ?
anna , usa faith / religion must be placed in the classroom .
it 's ignorant to deny its role in history , politics , culture ... and the day-to-day life of italy .
it 's bigoted to deny any metaphysical dimension to the world .
however , as a christian , i aint impressed with suppression of other religious views .
' elites ' set themselves up as religions ; but goodness knows what mr. keesee is banging on about : the eu ... international socialism . yeah right .
international capitalism more like !
you should pray for socialism if you care for god 's world .
andrew falconer , uk i agree .
religious symbols should be removed from any place of veneration in a secular school system .
larry , usa if italy truly has laws that apply to this situation , then i do n't have a problem with the ruling .
what i find sad though is that all this talk of multi-culturalism is really leading us to no-culturalism .
if everything that any one person disagrees with are banned , it will be a very boring world indeed that we leave to our children .
gary patterson , usa the cross should stay , when in rome do as the roman 's do .
n gorton , uk expat / canada why should n't there be religious symbols in schools ?
religions are part of human history .
religions are the base of the different cultures .
there is a lot of wisdom in all the different religions .
i think teaching about religions should be compulsory .
it is ignorance that creates intolerance , not knowledge .
harriet , singapore / nl it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around edwin thornber , uk / romania let muslim countries ban their religious symbols in their own countries before complaining about religious symbols in other countries .
it is surely a bit like complaining that italians speak italian .
it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around .
may be islam should be banned .
edwin thornber , uk / romania since christianity lies at the very foundation of european civilisation , history and law - and most especially italy 's - it is perfectly acceptable to have christian symbols in places where children are educated .
when we abandon the principles of christianity in order to please those of other faiths we tread a dangerous path .
dorothy , belgium i am an italian boy and my point of view is all religious symbols should be kept out from public schools and courts .
all religions must be respect each other , and one day we 'll live in a multi-cultural society .
italo p. , ripatransone italy i find it scary that signs of some religious affiliations are being banned , but others are somehow protected .
why is it ok to wear a headscarf , but not ok to wear a cross ?
why can children in the us swear and threaten their teachers in the name of free speech , but they can not pray in school ?
we have effectively removed god -lrb- by any name or form -rrb- from the public life in the us , now we wonder why our children lack direction and honour ?
sandra , us separating religion and state should be a must in all countries stefan , europe separating religion and state should be a must in all countries .
this means removing religious icons from classrooms , courthouses and other public places .
however there should also be freedom of religion .
this means that individuals should be allowed to wear a cross or a headscarf even in school or at work , individuals not government paid institutions should have the choice whether or not to display their religion publicly .
another option would be that public institutions should allow individuals to request their own religious symbol to be added if one of another religion is already present .
this might even help boost the tolerance between religions .
stefan , europe as an atheist i find all religious symbols to be at worst offensive and at best , irrelevant .
i would rather my children not have to observe these blinkered symbols of spiritual oppression , whichever of the main faiths they come from , they have no place in schools although nor does prayer or any other type of faith based activity .
john keegans , nottingham , uk this issue is primarily one of national sovereignty , as far as i am concerned .
there is clearly a general consensus and a deep-rooted tradition among the italians to display the crucifix symbol .
italy is not bound by the formal law in france of 1905 entirely separating religion and state , nor should it be made to bow to the whims of the eurocrats in brussels .
the way things are going , one day the flags of england , the uk , the scandinavian countries , and greece may be forced to remove their cross symbols on the grounds that they portray religious exclusivity .
jacob , uk those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue sean , belgium i could not imagine jesus christ or mohammed arguing over these symbols .
all parties involved have missed the point .
those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue .
the right to have the symbol is as strong as the right to remove the symbol .
let the children decide !
sean , belgium is italy not a predominantly catholic country ?
could a christian go to a muslim country and demand that they remove all islamic symbols ?
i think not .
if a muslim wants to reside in a christian country they have to tolerate the religion .
unlike in muslim countries where it is a crime to display crucifixes and possess bibles .
i can not believe the stupidity of the italian judge .
shame on him .
ben aldorino , uk i fail to see how the banning of religious symbols sends a message of multiculturalism and tolerance .
schools should encourage discussion about different religion and cultures because , far from being irrelevant , it seems to be increasingly relevant in the age we are living in .
helen , uk having lived and worked in saudi arabia for 11 years where you ca n't even wear a crucifix on a chain round you neck , take a bible into the kingdom , hold any kind of religious service , or even enter the city of mecca .
where they even stopped swiss air from flying into the kingdom because there plane had a red cross on the tailplane .
all i can say to this muslim leader in italy is " when in rome do as the romans do " and think him self lucky he has some where to go and pray in italy , because in arabia catholics and christians do n't .
r.l.tasker roger tasker , italy why should crosses or any religious symbols be removed ?
if we want a free , tolerant and open minded society , i see no reason why religious symbols should be banned .
i think the decision shows a lack of maturity - just another sign of cultural sanitisation .
js , norwich , uk it is strange that one insists that a cross be removed from a classroom and another is permitted a headscarf in the classroom .
looks like some have their cake and get to eat it .
doug , sweden such traditions are difficult to change , but the value of having a genuinely secular state is now known to be strongly positive .
the change is correct .
cliff , usa the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision raimundo l. santos , brazil the crucifix is an important symbol for christians .
as a catholic i do n't see any point in removing our christian symbols for fear any other religion would not like or approve of it .
if i were living in a muslim country for example , i would n't feel scandalized just to see women in their burkas and veils , or men wearing their turbans .
moreover , i suppose " judges " or the like in muslim countries are not really concerned if we christians approve or disapprove of their habits and customs , so why should we ?
the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision , which might as well offend catholics .
raimundo l. santos , brazil if italy 's present laws do , at least on paper , separate the church from the state , then it definitely should have been removed .
i 'm actually surprised this is getting so much attention - while living in italy , going to church in italy , i found most italians did n't regularly attend church .
as for christians in muslim countries , mentioned below - perhaps that 's why these muslims do not live in said countries ?
christina , usa the eu elites see religion as an obstacle not an asset .
the catholic church is a symbol of italy as is the lutheran church in germany and the anglican church in britain and the orthodox churches in eastern europe .
the euro elites want people from sicily to scandinavia to bow to them .
eliminating the religions that are associated with nations and replacing it with their rootless worship of international socialism then the eu elites can further their agenda against national sovereignty .
colin keesee , usa it 's a shame that no mention was made that the muslim man had requested an islamic symbol be represented along side the crucifix .
i 'm not sure i agree with going to court over such an issue when clearly in a country that is predominantly christian .
however , i believe that religious symbols should be removed and teaching kids about different faiths and religions is important to bridge the gap of ignorance between us all .
zak , uk in any country that went through the reformation this would be a non-issue .
but this is italy : the church still plays a massive role in the country 's political life and people 's mind set is not ready yet to deal with a society that only recently has started to become relatively multicultural .
religion should stay out of the classroom .
matteo garavoglia , italy , eu interestingly , many of the non-religious contributors seem to be as , or more , intolerant of religious expression than the religions they view with disdain as intolerant !
mark , scotland a crucifix in the classroom is the tip of the iceberg in italy vanessa , uk / italy unfortunately italy has the vatican within its borders , all the political parties try to seek favour with the catholic faith , see the recent debacle on the proposed law for a quick divorce .
i would ban crucifix not only in the schools , but in the courts -lrb- yes , they are present there too -rrb- .
i would ban the religious lessons in schools , taught by teachers that the bishop chooses , not the state education .
a crucifix in the class room is the tip of the iceberg in italy , the church interferes everywhere , unfortunately an , in my view , unpleasant man like smith has started this debate that has been long overdue .
vanessa , uk / italy the crucifix is as much a cultural symbol as a religious one .
it represents centuries of european civilisation and should not be lightly discarded .
richard cotton , london , uk the problem of separation of ' religion in schools ' would go away if the government followed the bastiat principle of limiting the law to its task and letting private institutions educate and provide services .
then the private institutions could be religious or a-religious and it would be fine .
ewan , uk it seems reasonable to remove the crucifix from the classroom if it affects the sentiments of people in the community .
however by taking out a so-called religious symbol , are we not endorsing another symbol ?
let 's just remember that having ' no symbols ' is not fair to all .
it is still subscribing to a particular view .
neil , india in the new europe whose culture is becoming dominated by -lrb- or reduced to -rrb- shopping centres , clearly the elite find the catholic church to be an obstacle to be suppressed .
clearly it is disadvantageous if people have things on their minds other than consumption .
the muslim minority is essentially a tool in the hands of the euro-buros in this case in the suppression of traditions that do not suit their taste .
balazs , italy all this fuss over religion - what about the kids ?
in schools they should be " educated " to be tolerant and loving !
plaster casts on walls or symbols of this or that are irrelevant .
it 's what 's taught them about love and international caring that matters - otherwise shut the schools !
stephen , thailand religious symbols should never be displayed in schools ... especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others keith , canada i believed italians were smart and educated - how can they allow such nonsense in a classroom and mislead their children ?
religion should be a personal matter and it should never be symbolised in a place where there are people of mixed or no faith .
amjad farooq , us i do not tend to agree with the judge 's decision .
if the other religion 's leader is not happy with the crucifix because this may influence muslim children in my opinion it would be more prudent if he asked to fix a muslim symbol on the walls near the catholic symbol .
alfred mallia , malta i think the separation of church and state is so heavily enforced in the west that in a way it actually promotes atheism .
i would prefer the way we handle this in bangladesh .
we are a multi-religious country where most of the major religions in the nation are recognised .
if i 'm not mistaken , the muslim leader initially asked for the school to put a muslim symbol beside the cross in the classroom , but the school refused .
i therefore support the judge 's decision to hold every religion with equal respect .
arif joarder , bangladesh religion should stay out of the classroom , period kent , canada it 's unfair that the initial suggestion by adel smith to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix should have been denied .
therefore it 's only fair that the crucifix be removed altogether to avoid creating a kind of religious superiority which is totally out of place in a multi-racial society .
patricia , italy it will inflame tensions between faiths , but i think it is a fair ruling as long all faiths are respected rodrigo , paraguay religious symbols have no place in a classroom .
religion is undoubtedly a private matter and should be kept so in the future .
neil jones , united kingdom religion should stay out of the classroom , period .
kent , canada italy was born -lrb- less than 150 years ago -rrb- when the laws of piedmont -lrb- a secular country -rrb- were extended to italy at unification .
italy stayed secular until fascism , when mussolini bought the support of the catholic church by turning back the clock on separation between religion and state .
hence the recent court judgment is in line with italy 's history and gives back to the italians the secular state that is part of their democratic traditions .
silvio sandrone , turin , piedmont -lrb- italy -rrb- muslims want to have religious rights in christian countries , do they grant the same rights to christians in muslim countries ?
adam schott , australia i strongly agree with the judge 's decision .
a fascist state was responsible for the current law .
this issue is a no-brainer and the vatican must be stopped from imposing its agenda on people who do not subscribe to it .
richard , us here in italy , we have one hour a week of confessional catholic teaching in every school .
if you do n't like that you have to opt-out .
in my opinion , that 's the problem , not the crucifix .
paolo , italy religious symbols should never be displayed in schools .
and especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others .
keith , canada in state schools there is no place for one religion over another john , france i do n't mind religious symbols in public -lrb- as art -rrb- .
however , as children are so susceptible to the ideas of others above their own , it seems inappropriate for public school to " endorse " any religion .
if children wish to express themselves -lrb- wearing crosses , headscarves -rrb- , this seems innocent .
it is the expression of the child and his or her family , rather than the state communicating a preference to the children .
aleta , united states i ca n't accept that a judge is trying to erase a part of our culture and history with a sentence .
and i ca n't accept that this request comes from a man who believes to be the head of italian muslims and who has always talked so badly of the catholic religion .
and so why do n't we sweep off the red cross symbol ?
michele , italy as a christian i strongly believe that the church and state must be kept separate and state must not and should not support or favour or endorse any one religion as this is a step toward state control of freedom .
crosses i feel are fine in home or in a local church but not in government-run institutions .
mark flanagan , sweden i ca n't help thinking that if it had been the opposite and a catholic had sought the removal of islamic symbols , they would have been slammed for being racist .
once again national culture and history are sacrificed on the altar of political correctness .
dean , uk all religious symbols should -lrb- must -rrb- be removed from public places and public use .
they should be allowed in places of worship of the particular religion / belief or in any individual 's home .
public no , schools no .
miklos nomad , hungary in state schools there is no place for one religion over another and there should be no display of any symbol - crucifix , head scarf or turban .
john , france of course it will inflame tensions between faiths .
italy is , and has within it , the centre of the catholic faith .
to coin a phrase " when in rome ! "
les woods , england / uk religion should be in schools only as part of history or psychology , studied with myths , legends , fairytales and superstitions .
nigel rees , uk / usa it will inflame tensions - europe has been christian for thousands of years and many will see this as foreigners removing our heritage .
tom , england a complete ban on all religious symbols on the walls of schools could be put in place to " show the unequivocal desire by the state ... to place atheism at the centre of the universe " .
whatever is done will be wrong .
as for inflaming tensions between religions , the whole effect of serious and committed religious belief is to preclude tolerance of others .
no religion has ever accepted that others have a right to exist let alone that they might also be correct in their beliefs .
after all their ' holy book ' proves that they are right .

a court decision to order a state kindergarten to remove crucifixes from its classrooms has caused controversy in italy .
the ruling by a judge in the central town of l 'aquila , following a complaint by an italian muslim leader , has re-opened a bitter debate about religious symbols .
the judge ruled that crucifixes on classroom walls showed " the unequivocal desire by the state , when it comes to public education , to place the catholic religion at the centre of the universe " , disregarding other religions .
do you agree with the decision ?
or could it inflame tensions between faiths ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : i think there should be no crucifixes in the classrooms .
its no problem for me that children learn about the christian religion but if so then why not to learn about all religions .
they should know other point of views to become more tolerant and to retard conflicts .
i grew up in poland with the crucifixes in the classrooms but now i live in germany .
i was told in the school to love all human beings but on the other hand i heard that the other religions are dangerous .
generally each religion can be dangerous .
bozena , germany crosses bearing idols of jesus breach the first commandment as does worship of jesus ' mother and should be banned everywhere .
as a christian i wear an empty cross to remind me there is no death , that i am free and i have promised to treat others as i would like to be treated .
all symbols are personal and should not be backed by government organisations , especially schools .
jesus directed we pray at home , in privacy .
if all followed his advice , there would be no churches with their power to exert power , gather wealth and manipulate gullible and superstitious people .
lionel hurst , australia this is clearly a problem of intolerance of the host country by an outsider , mr smith the muslim leader has also called for the removal of a 15th century christian fresco in bologna cathedral on the grounds that it shows the prophet mohammed this man is absolutely determined to ignore the fact that as a immigrant he should respect the culture and customs of his new adopted land .
yan michek , switzerland the cross simply says , " truth will set you free . "
it is thus the perfect symbol for what we call an education .
it shows us the cosmic relationship between truth and sacrifice .
but it is more that just a symbol .
it is a guide that helps us find meaning in notions like equality , democracy , love and it beckons us to love our neighbours as one .
it is a guide to peace .
who would dare take it down ?
taeho paik , italy why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- as an italian i 'm very happy about the judge 's decision , it 's about time the crucifixes get removed from state schools , and i know many other italians who think the same .
it 's only unfortunate the case was brought up by a muslim because this gives crucifix supporters an easy excuse to blame " foreigners " for destroying italy 's culture .
this has nothing to do with culture , as a non religious italian i demand crucifixes to be removed from any state building too , they belong in churches !
why should my children be confronted daily with a quite macabre symbol of one particular religion that is loosing support fast in italy anyway ?
andrea , italy -lrb- currently uk -rrb- yes !
they should be banned in all ' state ' schools and establishments .
in a ' religious ' school of whatever faith , and where there are clear alternative schools where pupils can be sent , then they should be allowed .
this gives the choice of ' education and indoctrination ' to the parents of the pupils .
' religion ' should also be taken out of any school curricula .
if any parent wants their offspring to be educated in a ' religious ' way then let them go to the nearest appropriate religious establishment , be it a christian on or for any other religion .
b w moore , ne uk i think that everyone is missing the real reason behind the banning of the crucifix .
islam , judaism and christianity -lrb- in its true aramaic form -rrb- strictly forbid the use of idols , pictures etc depicting what prophets looked like .
this is primarily to stop the practice of idol worship which many modern day christians are accustomed to .
the crucifix in the past has been used as a tool by the missionaries to ' tame the savages ' into believing that jesus christ -lrb- peace be upon him -rrb- was a blonde-haired , blue-eyed european rather than a palestinian .
muslims are opposed to the depiction of the prophet jesus in this way .
they are not opposed to the fact that they are being misrepresented in the classroom !
e malik , uk as a roman catholic , i am shocked that one guy can change thousands of years of tradition .
italia is a catholic country and the cross is part of italia 's culture ... if mr. smith does n't like to raise his children in a place where catholics and catholic symbols are predominant , then he needs to pick up and move to saudi arabia or albania ... does it bother mr. smith that his children see the crosses on top of all the great churches of italy ?
should we remove all crosses and church towers around the catholic world , or should we just put a muslim symbol on top of each tower next to the cross to make it to his liking ?
should we not offer pork in our stores , because muslims do n't want to see it ?
marko latinovic , mostar , bosnia-herzegovina i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland in poland there are at least 95 % classrooms with crosses .
it is really funny and ironic .
people do n't care about them .
they should be removed as should be removed " religion " lesson - and moved to the church !
we 've got to learn about other religions too , how to live and understand others .
i think that place of crosses and religion is home , church or hearts of believers ...
maciek , poland italy 's constitution promises freedom of religion , just as most modern western constitutions do .
religious symbols are not appropriate in government schools .
christopher c. tew , usa groups come in and want to take over and change centuries of tradition and culture with one shout of discrimination .
if you choose to go to another country with a different culture and religion , it is the immigrant who has the responsibility for adapting , not the society itself .
gianna , usa i find it extremely depressing to see that , again , the wishes of a few surpass the wishes of the many .
culture and heritage are being erased in order to avoid offending the intolerant .
shannon simons , usa it 's common for christians to feel that this is an act against them , but so would the placing of other religion 's symbols next to their own .
the use of the crucifix to me is seems a bit like idol worship .
my relationship with god is not governed by having pictures laying around , but by the conversations we have .
wwill foster , usa the only option is to keep the state totally secular paul qureshi , uk if religious symbols are to be endorsed by the state and placed in classrooms , then all religions must be represented .
this raises two issues .
firstly , what constitutes a religion ?
many people put " jedi " on their census form , would that mean a light-sabre has to be on the wall too ?
secondly , many people would object to , say , satanist symbols , but they too would have to be displayed .
clearly , the only option is to keep the state and all state operated organisations totally secular .
this does not prevent anyone practicing their religion , nor force religion on them .
paul qureshi , uk like the old saying goes , " when in rome , do as the romans do . "
obviously , the muslim leader has never heard this before and does not understand the wisdom behind accepting the cultural aspect of one 's adopted country .
anthony , usa do n't forget that this man went to court when the school refused to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix in his children 's classroom .
so who is being intolerant here ?
if you 're for freedom of religion , let all religions have freedom .
if you 're for secularism , then ban all religious symbols .
people should n't use this issue to unfairly attack muslims yet again when it 's clear that the intolerance stems from others .
bilal patel , london , uk i am not very passionate about religion and this issue .
however , perhaps a better option would be to add some symbols of other religions and so to acknowledge and invite their contribution to national / local culture rather than pretending none of them counts or exists .
dariusz , poland but i would question why anyone would find this offensive jim , nj , usa the decision is technically correct because true democracies must be secular .
but i would question why anyone would find this offensive .
christ is n't going to jump off that cross and start converting children of other faiths by force .
the fact that the plaintiff originally wanted another religious symbol added , rather than the removal of the crucifix , proves he was not motivated by democratic ideals .
this is a case of a harmless tradition taken away for childish motives - " if i ca n't have my way , you ca n't have yours either " .
jim , nj , usa yes .
i agree with the ruling .
christians need to realize that they are just one religion with no more authenticity than any other .
tom cunningham , usa if you go to the beach , the wear a swimsuit .
if you 're going to a board meeting , you wear a three-piece suit .
if you going to school , you 're going to study math , literature , biology , and if you want to read the bible , koran , torah or whatever and pray and all that stuff , you go to church , which is where the cross belongs .
it 's very logical , very simple , and the rule of law .
a swimsuit would be out of place in the board room as would a three-piece suit at the beach .
can the cross - it 's out of place , and get over it .
let 's get on with education our young .
bobbi roman , usa what happens to christian residents in muslim countries ?
does any muslim judge dare to ban the half moon or whatever from classrooms in respect of christians ? ? ?
guests must respect the country in which they are hosted , its law and its traditions too .
host countries must surely respect their guests but must respect first their traditions and their native people .
fabio , italy children should not be indoctrinated with religion .
there is enough time when they are adults and more knowledgeable for them to decide if they want to join a religious group .
in the meantime , let us keep any kind of religious symbols out of the classrooms of public schools .
nyakairu , novi , usa like it or not , europe is the main place where christianity grew , in the same way the middle east and asia is where islam grew .
hence a lot of christian symbols here and a lot of islamic symbols in the middle east etc .
some largely muslim countries have crescents on their flags in the same way crosses often appear on european flags .
what we need is mutual respect which means muslims must respect our faith , culture and history in the same way they want us to respect theirs .
the judge 's decision was wrong because it will only cause resentment not respect .
fabian , uk by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed jose nigrin , guatemala when any country has a national recognized religion , the result will be the creation of second class citizens , that do n't profess this religion , and suffer discrimination in jobs , education , and opportunities for improvements .
by promoting religious symbols , freedom of religion in a democratic country is curtailed in favour of the main official credo .
jose nigrin , guatemala in public schools absolutely .
in religious ones , no problem .
leduc jean-francois , bangkok thailand what business does a crucifix have in a classroom to begin with ?
if you want to teach your children about a religion , go for it ; however that has nothing to do with public schooling .
if i were a school teacher and decided that i would like to have a statue of ganesh , i think i might get a little flack about it , so why should a crucifix be allowed ?
mike , usa as long as the teacher does not try to convert the children to a particular faith , we should not take away the right to free speech and beliefs .
gareth giles , england i think the cross should have stayed on the wall .
i would suggest , if the man disagrees with the symbol as much as that , then he take his children to a kindergarten that does not outwardly show it 's moral standpoint and not enforce oppression upon the other 99 % of class attendees callum w , uk many contributors are missing the point .
italy is a secular state , therefore the separation of state and religion -lrb- unlike the majority of muslim countries that profess nothing of the sort - the comparative argument thus being moot -rrb- .
the kindergarten being state run had no authority to place a catholic religious symbol in classrooms to the exclusion of all other religions .
the court 's decision was not only fair but based on the rule of law .
people who think otherwise are feeding the debate and controversy regarding islam and the west .
what they should remember is that the crux of all major world religions is tolerance .
h. schmitt , germany not banned nor compulsory .
states should not rule on religion .
people must be free to choose their faith and symbols .
ricardo , brazil the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions arif , england as muslim child i went to a church of england primary school , as did all my siblings .
we even went to church on numerous occasions with school !
in no way did this affect my religious identity or my faith .
all my family are devout muslims .
we never had any problems with the symbols of christianity that we visible in school .
the decision in italy will definitely inflame tensions .
rather than removing symbols of christianity , symbols of other religions should be allowed in schools , so that we can celebrate or differences in a spirit of understanding , mutual respect and tolerance .
arif , england if the crucifix was on the wall of a catholic or christian school then what is the problem ?
if the muslim leader is in such a school and being in a predominantly christian country surely he must respect the local customs and cultures as he would expect anyone else to if they were in a muslim country , as others have said " when in rome etc . "
vivienne , uk a crucifix is a reminder that jesus the son of god died for our sins .
this is valid for moslems , jews , christians and atheists alike , even though some may not want to accept this truth .
aj , germany why should we remove the symbols of our faiths ?
i follow no religious order but i respect the views of people who do , if we went to muslim countries and started demanding they stop / remove items of their faith , we would be thrown out , this is pc gone mad , next thing on the hit list will be stopping xmas / easter etc .
and people wonder why extreme political parties are gaining ground , why does no one listen ?
j mulligan , uk how are children expected to learn about religion , if we keep banning it ?
surely this teaches intolerance !
susan , uk as dominant as christianity is in italy , the crucifix symbolizes centuries of oppression to those not of the faith .
the current saudi style of religious intolerance is no more extreme , or irrational , than that practiced by vatican inspired governments .
what islamic , jewish , hindi , wiccan , agnostic or atheistic child or adult benefits from the singular presence of a religious symbol in a secular learning environment ?
can the cross ?
amen !
ralph , usa it should be only displayed in religious schools manuel , macedonia the crucifix -lrb- which is , either you like it or not , a somewhat morbid symbol with jesus nailed on the cross , bleeding to death -rrb- and portrays the catholic religion with all the respect that it deserves , like any other religion .
therefore it should be only displayed in religious schools .
likewise , islam should abstain to portray religious symbols in non-religious schools .
islam should also refrain from getting into squabbling over religious issues as it will only lead to a growing divide between the west and muslim countries .
it is shameful that both religions fight over spirituality and the same god , despite the way he is perceived and loved by each other .
manuel , macedonia what 's next - banning christmas trees , carol singers and easter eggs ... they are all symbols of christian festivals ...
lisa , italy we think that it could be a good decision , because many and many italian do n't believe in god , especially young people and the school is lay and everyone could believe in what he or she wants .
anyway if someone wants a crucifix in his classroom , he has to allow everyone to put on the walls his own idols .
however we have to identify this case like a case of destroy the catholic religion at the base .
giovanni & riki , italy in our opinion , the cross is a religious symbol so it has n't to be on school 's walls because the school is lay institution .
so putting away from school 's walls the cross is right also because italy is a democratic country and it should n't impose its religion .
we 're christians so we believe in god but we think that the school is n't the place to show our religion because there are others buildings for this -lrb- churches -rrb- !
that 's all !
pamela & roberta , italy the crucifix is intrinsic to history anna , usa lately it seems we are bothered when there are mixed displays of sentiment and opinion .
the crucifix is intrinsic to history .
it is a monument of a culture and a movement and though you may not personally prescribe to it , it is still an integral part of the societies of today .
should we forget history because it bothers us ?
anna , usa faith / religion must be placed in the classroom .
it 's ignorant to deny its role in history , politics , culture ... and the day-to-day life of italy .
it 's bigoted to deny any metaphysical dimension to the world .
however , as a christian , i aint impressed with suppression of other religious views .
' elites ' set themselves up as religions ; but goodness knows what mr. keesee is banging on about : the eu ... international socialism . yeah right .
international capitalism more like !
you should pray for socialism if you care for god 's world .
andrew falconer , uk i agree .
religious symbols should be removed from any place of veneration in a secular school system .
larry , usa if italy truly has laws that apply to this situation , then i do n't have a problem with the ruling .
what i find sad though is that all this talk of multi-culturalism is really leading us to no-culturalism .
if everything that any one person disagrees with are banned , it will be a very boring world indeed that we leave to our children .
gary patterson , usa the cross should stay , when in rome do as the roman 's do .
n gorton , uk expat / canada why should n't there be religious symbols in schools ?
religions are part of human history .
religions are the base of the different cultures .
there is a lot of wisdom in all the different religions .
i think teaching about religions should be compulsory .
it is ignorance that creates intolerance , not knowledge .
harriet , singapore / nl it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around edwin thornber , uk / romania let muslim countries ban their religious symbols in their own countries before complaining about religious symbols in other countries .
it is surely a bit like complaining that italians speak italian .
it appears to me that islam is one of the most extremely intolerant faiths around .
may be islam should be banned .
edwin thornber , uk / romania since christianity lies at the very foundation of european civilisation , history and law - and most especially italy 's - it is perfectly acceptable to have christian symbols in places where children are educated .
when we abandon the principles of christianity in order to please those of other faiths we tread a dangerous path .
dorothy , belgium i am an italian boy and my point of view is all religious symbols should be kept out from public schools and courts .
all religions must be respect each other , and one day we 'll live in a multi-cultural society .
italo p. , ripatransone italy i find it scary that signs of some religious affiliations are being banned , but others are somehow protected .
why is it ok to wear a headscarf , but not ok to wear a cross ?
why can children in the us swear and threaten their teachers in the name of free speech , but they can not pray in school ?
we have effectively removed god -lrb- by any name or form -rrb- from the public life in the us , now we wonder why our children lack direction and honour ?
sandra , us separating religion and state should be a must in all countries stefan , europe separating religion and state should be a must in all countries .
this means removing religious icons from classrooms , courthouses and other public places .
however there should also be freedom of religion .
this means that individuals should be allowed to wear a cross or a headscarf even in school or at work , individuals not government paid institutions should have the choice whether or not to display their religion publicly .
another option would be that public institutions should allow individuals to request their own religious symbol to be added if one of another religion is already present .
this might even help boost the tolerance between religions .
stefan , europe as an atheist i find all religious symbols to be at worst offensive and at best , irrelevant .
i would rather my children not have to observe these blinkered symbols of spiritual oppression , whichever of the main faiths they come from , they have no place in schools although nor does prayer or any other type of faith based activity .
john keegans , nottingham , uk this issue is primarily one of national sovereignty , as far as i am concerned .
there is clearly a general consensus and a deep-rooted tradition among the italians to display the crucifix symbol .
italy is not bound by the formal law in france of 1905 entirely separating religion and state , nor should it be made to bow to the whims of the eurocrats in brussels .
the way things are going , one day the flags of england , the uk , the scandinavian countries , and greece may be forced to remove their cross symbols on the grounds that they portray religious exclusivity .
jacob , uk those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue sean , belgium i could not imagine jesus christ or mohammed arguing over these symbols .
all parties involved have missed the point .
those with true faith and confidence would not trifle themselves with this issue .
the right to have the symbol is as strong as the right to remove the symbol .
let the children decide !
sean , belgium is italy not a predominantly catholic country ?
could a christian go to a muslim country and demand that they remove all islamic symbols ?
i think not .
if a muslim wants to reside in a christian country they have to tolerate the religion .
unlike in muslim countries where it is a crime to display crucifixes and possess bibles .
i can not believe the stupidity of the italian judge .
shame on him .
ben aldorino , uk i fail to see how the banning of religious symbols sends a message of multiculturalism and tolerance .
schools should encourage discussion about different religion and cultures because , far from being irrelevant , it seems to be increasingly relevant in the age we are living in .
helen , uk having lived and worked in saudi arabia for 11 years where you ca n't even wear a crucifix on a chain round you neck , take a bible into the kingdom , hold any kind of religious service , or even enter the city of mecca .
where they even stopped swiss air from flying into the kingdom because there plane had a red cross on the tailplane .
all i can say to this muslim leader in italy is " when in rome do as the romans do " and think him self lucky he has some where to go and pray in italy , because in arabia catholics and christians do n't .
r.l.tasker roger tasker , italy why should crosses or any religious symbols be removed ?
if we want a free , tolerant and open minded society , i see no reason why religious symbols should be banned .
i think the decision shows a lack of maturity - just another sign of cultural sanitisation .
js , norwich , uk it is strange that one insists that a cross be removed from a classroom and another is permitted a headscarf in the classroom .
looks like some have their cake and get to eat it .
doug , sweden such traditions are difficult to change , but the value of having a genuinely secular state is now known to be strongly positive .
the change is correct .
cliff , usa the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision raimundo l. santos , brazil the crucifix is an important symbol for christians .
as a catholic i do n't see any point in removing our christian symbols for fear any other religion would not like or approve of it .
if i were living in a muslim country for example , i would n't feel scandalized just to see women in their burkas and veils , or men wearing their turbans .
moreover , i suppose " judges " or the like in muslim countries are not really concerned if we christians approve or disapprove of their habits and customs , so why should we ?
the italian judge put his foot in it by taking such a wrong unfair decision , which might as well offend catholics .
raimundo l. santos , brazil if italy 's present laws do , at least on paper , separate the church from the state , then it definitely should have been removed .
i 'm actually surprised this is getting so much attention - while living in italy , going to church in italy , i found most italians did n't regularly attend church .
as for christians in muslim countries , mentioned below - perhaps that 's why these muslims do not live in said countries ?
christina , usa the eu elites see religion as an obstacle not an asset .
the catholic church is a symbol of italy as is the lutheran church in germany and the anglican church in britain and the orthodox churches in eastern europe .
the euro elites want people from sicily to scandinavia to bow to them .
eliminating the religions that are associated with nations and replacing it with their rootless worship of international socialism then the eu elites can further their agenda against national sovereignty .
colin keesee , usa it 's a shame that no mention was made that the muslim man had requested an islamic symbol be represented along side the crucifix .
i 'm not sure i agree with going to court over such an issue when clearly in a country that is predominantly christian .
however , i believe that religious symbols should be removed and teaching kids about different faiths and religions is important to bridge the gap of ignorance between us all .
zak , uk in any country that went through the reformation this would be a non-issue .
but this is italy : the church still plays a massive role in the country 's political life and people 's mind set is not ready yet to deal with a society that only recently has started to become relatively multicultural .
religion should stay out of the classroom .
matteo garavoglia , italy , eu interestingly , many of the non-religious contributors seem to be as , or more , intolerant of religious expression than the religions they view with disdain as intolerant !
mark , scotland a crucifix in the classroom is the tip of the iceberg in italy vanessa , uk / italy unfortunately italy has the vatican within its borders , all the political parties try to seek favour with the catholic faith , see the recent debacle on the proposed law for a quick divorce .
i would ban crucifix not only in the schools , but in the courts -lrb- yes , they are present there too -rrb- .
i would ban the religious lessons in schools , taught by teachers that the bishop chooses , not the state education .
a crucifix in the class room is the tip of the iceberg in italy , the church interferes everywhere , unfortunately an , in my view , unpleasant man like smith has started this debate that has been long overdue .
vanessa , uk / italy the crucifix is as much a cultural symbol as a religious one .
it represents centuries of european civilisation and should not be lightly discarded .
richard cotton , london , uk the problem of separation of ' religion in schools ' would go away if the government followed the bastiat principle of limiting the law to its task and letting private institutions educate and provide services .
then the private institutions could be religious or a-religious and it would be fine .
ewan , uk it seems reasonable to remove the crucifix from the classroom if it affects the sentiments of people in the community .
however by taking out a so-called religious symbol , are we not endorsing another symbol ?
let 's just remember that having ' no symbols ' is not fair to all .
it is still subscribing to a particular view .
neil , india in the new europe whose culture is becoming dominated by -lrb- or reduced to -rrb- shopping centres , clearly the elite find the catholic church to be an obstacle to be suppressed .
clearly it is disadvantageous if people have things on their minds other than consumption .
the muslim minority is essentially a tool in the hands of the euro-buros in this case in the suppression of traditions that do not suit their taste .
balazs , italy all this fuss over religion - what about the kids ?
in schools they should be " educated " to be tolerant and loving !
plaster casts on walls or symbols of this or that are irrelevant .
it 's what 's taught them about love and international caring that matters - otherwise shut the schools !
stephen , thailand religious symbols should never be displayed in schools ... especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others keith , canada i believed italians were smart and educated - how can they allow such nonsense in a classroom and mislead their children ?
religion should be a personal matter and it should never be symbolised in a place where there are people of mixed or no faith .
amjad farooq , us i do not tend to agree with the judge 's decision .
if the other religion 's leader is not happy with the crucifix because this may influence muslim children in my opinion it would be more prudent if he asked to fix a muslim symbol on the walls near the catholic symbol .
alfred mallia , malta i think the separation of church and state is so heavily enforced in the west that in a way it actually promotes atheism .
i would prefer the way we handle this in bangladesh .
we are a multi-religious country where most of the major religions in the nation are recognised .
if i 'm not mistaken , the muslim leader initially asked for the school to put a muslim symbol beside the cross in the classroom , but the school refused .
i therefore support the judge 's decision to hold every religion with equal respect .
arif joarder , bangladesh religion should stay out of the classroom , period kent , canada it 's unfair that the initial suggestion by adel smith to display a symbol from the koran alongside the crucifix should have been denied .
therefore it 's only fair that the crucifix be removed altogether to avoid creating a kind of religious superiority which is totally out of place in a multi-racial society .
patricia , italy it will inflame tensions between faiths , but i think it is a fair ruling as long all faiths are respected rodrigo , paraguay religious symbols have no place in a classroom .
religion is undoubtedly a private matter and should be kept so in the future .
neil jones , united kingdom religion should stay out of the classroom , period .
kent , canada italy was born -lrb- less than 150 years ago -rrb- when the laws of piedmont -lrb- a secular country -rrb- were extended to italy at unification .
italy stayed secular until fascism , when mussolini bought the support of the catholic church by turning back the clock on separation between religion and state .
hence the recent court judgment is in line with italy 's history and gives back to the italians the secular state that is part of their democratic traditions .
silvio sandrone , turin , piedmont -lrb- italy -rrb- muslims want to have religious rights in christian countries , do they grant the same rights to christians in muslim countries ?
adam schott , australia i strongly agree with the judge 's decision .
a fascist state was responsible for the current law .
this issue is a no-brainer and the vatican must be stopped from imposing its agenda on people who do not subscribe to it .
richard , us here in italy , we have one hour a week of confessional catholic teaching in every school .
if you do n't like that you have to opt-out .
in my opinion , that 's the problem , not the crucifix .
paolo , italy religious symbols should never be displayed in schools .
and especially not symbols that promote one faith over all others .
keith , canada in state schools there is no place for one religion over another john , france i do n't mind religious symbols in public -lrb- as art -rrb- .
however , as children are so susceptible to the ideas of others above their own , it seems inappropriate for public school to " endorse " any religion .
if children wish to express themselves -lrb- wearing crosses , headscarves -rrb- , this seems innocent .
it is the expression of the child and his or her family , rather than the state communicating a preference to the children .
aleta , united states i ca n't accept that a judge is trying to erase a part of our culture and history with a sentence .
and i ca n't accept that this request comes from a man who believes to be the head of italian muslims and who has always talked so badly of the catholic religion .
and so why do n't we sweep off the red cross symbol ?
michele , italy as a christian i strongly believe that the church and state must be kept separate and state must not and should not support or favour or endorse any one religion as this is a step toward state control of freedom .
crosses i feel are fine in home or in a local church but not in government-run institutions .
mark flanagan , sweden i ca n't help thinking that if it had been the opposite and a catholic had sought the removal of islamic symbols , they would have been slammed for being racist .
once again national culture and history are sacrificed on the altar of political correctness .
dean , uk all religious symbols should -lrb- must -rrb- be removed from public places and public use .
they should be allowed in places of worship of the particular religion / belief or in any individual 's home .
public no , schools no .
miklos nomad , hungary in state schools there is no place for one religion over another and there should be no display of any symbol - crucifix , head scarf or turban .
john , france of course it will inflame tensions between faiths .
italy is , and has within it , the centre of the catholic faith .
to coin a phrase " when in rome ! "
les woods , england / uk religion should be in schools only as part of history or psychology , studied with myths , legends , fairytales and superstitions .
nigel rees , uk / usa it will inflame tensions - europe has been christian for thousands of years and many will see this as foreigners removing our heritage .
tom , england a complete ban on all religious symbols on the walls of schools could be put in place to " show the unequivocal desire by the state ... to place atheism at the centre of the universe " .
whatever is done will be wrong .
as for inflaming tensions between religions , the whole effect of serious and committed religious belief is to preclude tolerance of others .
no religion has ever accepted that others have a right to exist let alone that they might also be correct in their beliefs .
after all their ' holy book ' proves that they are right .
