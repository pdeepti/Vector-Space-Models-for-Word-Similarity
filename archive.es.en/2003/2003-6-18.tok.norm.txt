a paris court has ended the question of who will become the next ecb president .
bank of france governor jean-claude trichet was acquitted of corruption charges on wednesday . a french court acquitted bank of france governor jean-claude trichet of complicity in a corruption scandal on wednesday .
the ruling was the last obstacle preventing the economist from taking over the reins of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- from its current president , dutchman wim duisenberg .
trichet told the press he was " moved " by the verdict that dispelled accusations that he had known the state-supported bank crédit lyonnais kept misleading accounts while he was head of the french finance ministry 's treasury department in the 1990s .
romano prodi , european union commission president , welcomed the outcome of the trial , saying it would make the change at the top of the ecb " significantly easier . "
but the french public prosecutor said he was not sure if he would appeal the verdict .
he has until july 7 to decide .
if the matter is put to rest , trichet could be officially designated the next ecb president in the coming months .
next in line trichet has been in the running for the top position since the ecb was created .
he failed to get the job the first time around due to german unease over a frenchman pulling the bank ’ s strings .
instead the euro zone countries opted for the neutral dutchman duisenberg .
but after frankfurt was selected as the ecb headquarters five years ago , france insisted that the bank 's next head should be french .
the other 11 countries in the monetary union agreed to the demands , including the appeal for duisenberg 's eight-year term to be shortened to make room for france 's choice .
thus , the stage was set for trichet , one of france 's most respected bankers .
however , the investigation , which began in 2000 , and the subsequent trial in january 2003 of trichet and eight other defendants in the crédit lyonnais scandal put a halt to a smooth succession .
in april , duisenberg announced he would postpone his retirement - which was originally set for july 9 - to wait for the next in line .
who that was to be hinged on the outcome of wednesday ’ s trial .
despite the accusations against trichet , the financial community has always considered him a natural choice for the top post at the ecb .

faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
family planning programs , including pregnancy and motherhood benefits , would also be transferred out of the healthcare system and instead be covered by the federal budget – a transfer that would be financed by a previously announced , three-phase € 1 euro increase in taxes on each pack of cigarettes sold in germany .
the bill would also require a co-payment of € 15 each time a patient visited a specialist without a referral from his or her family doctor . the government also wants to establish a " center for quality in medicine , " which would determine which medical procedures and medications should be covered by public health funds .
it would establish treatment guidelines aimed at streamlining the handling of patients and , the government hopes , rein in costs .
patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .
cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .
" we ca n't do more than help , " the chancellor said at a recent bilateral meeting with the french president jacques chirac . germany 's ambassador to the u.n. , günter pleuger , offered similar remarks .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans , " he said .
" i do n't know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now . " but high-level defense officials are also weary of the nature of the conflict , in which young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said struck . will it be enough ? wrangling over german participation aside , critics wonder if the europe-wide effort to stop the fighting in congo will be enough .
the force , composed of soldiers from belgium , spain , italy , britain and france , will number near 1,700 . but the mission itself is very limited and clearly defined : troops wo n't be dispatched until july and they are expected to return by september .
given the long-standing nature of the hostilities , that might not be enough time .
as experience shows , fighting in the region resumed shortly after the ugandans withdrew in may . what 's more , the international peacekeeping force 's efforts will be restricted to the city of bunia , even though most inhabitants of the city have fled and much of the fighting is happening elsewhere . the international community , including germany , has approached the conflict with caution .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .
cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .
" we ca n't do more than help , " the chancellor said at a recent bilateral meeting with the french president jacques chirac . germany 's ambassador to the u.n. , günter pleuger , offered similar remarks .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans , " he said .
" i do n't know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now . " but high-level defense officials are also weary of the nature of the conflict , in which young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said struck . will it be enough ? wrangling over german participation aside , critics wonder if the europe-wide effort to stop the fighting in congo will be enough .
the force , composed of soldiers from belgium , spain , italy , britain and france , will number near 1,700 . but the mission itself is very limited and clearly defined : troops wo n't be dispatched until july and they are expected to return by september .
given the long-standing nature of the hostilities , that might not be enough time .
as experience shows , fighting in the region resumed shortly after the ugandans withdrew in may . what 's more , the international peacekeeping force 's efforts will be restricted to the city of bunia , even though most inhabitants of the city have fled and much of the fighting is happening elsewhere . the international community , including germany , has approached the conflict with caution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.06.2003 germany weighs difficult healthcare cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lawmakers think the public health system needs some intensive care .
faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
family planning programs , including pregnancy and motherhood benefits , would also be transferred out of the healthcare system and instead be covered by the federal budget – a transfer that would be financed by a previously announced , three-phase € 1 euro increase in taxes on each pack of cigarettes sold in germany .
the bill would also require a co-payment of € 15 each time a patient visited a specialist without a referral from his or her family doctor . the government also wants to establish a " center for quality in medicine , " which would determine which medical procedures and medications should be covered by public health funds .
it would establish treatment guidelines aimed at streamlining the handling of patients and , the government hopes , rein in costs .
patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .

the ruling was the last obstacle preventing the economist from taking over the reins of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- from its current president , dutchman wim duisenberg .

a paris court has ended the question of who will become the next ecb president .
bank of france governor jean-claude trichet was acquitted of corruption charges on wednesday . a french court acquitted bank of france governor jean-claude trichet of complicity in a corruption scandal on wednesday .
the ruling was the last obstacle preventing the economist from taking over the reins of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- from its current president , dutchman wim duisenberg .
trichet told the press he was " moved " by the verdict that dispelled accusations that he had known the state-supported bank crédit lyonnais kept misleading accounts while he was head of the french finance ministry 's treasury department in the 1990s .
romano prodi , european union commission president , welcomed the outcome of the trial , saying it would make the change at the top of the ecb " significantly easier . "
but the french public prosecutor said he was not sure if he would appeal the verdict .
he has until july 7 to decide .
if the matter is put to rest , trichet could be officially designated the next ecb president in the coming months .
next in line trichet has been in the running for the top position since the ecb was created .
he failed to get the job the first time around due to german unease over a frenchman pulling the bank ’ s strings .
instead the euro zone countries opted for the neutral dutchman duisenberg .
but after frankfurt was selected as the ecb headquarters five years ago , france insisted that the bank 's next head should be french .
the other 11 countries in the monetary union agreed to the demands , including the appeal for duisenberg 's eight-year term to be shortened to make room for france 's choice .
thus , the stage was set for trichet , one of france 's most respected bankers .
however , the investigation , which began in 2000 , and the subsequent trial in january 2003 of trichet and eight other defendants in the crédit lyonnais scandal put a halt to a smooth succession .
in april , duisenberg announced he would postpone his retirement - which was originally set for july 9 - to wait for the next in line .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .
cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .
" we ca n't do more than help , " the chancellor said at a recent bilateral meeting with the french president jacques chirac . germany 's ambassador to the u.n. , günter pleuger , offered similar remarks .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans , " he said .
" i do n't know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now . " but high-level defense officials are also weary of the nature of the conflict , in which young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said struck . will it be enough ? wrangling over german participation aside , critics wonder if the europe-wide effort to stop the fighting in congo will be enough .
the force , composed of soldiers from belgium , spain , italy , britain and france , will number near 1,700 . but the mission itself is very limited and clearly defined : troops wo n't be dispatched until july and they are expected to return by september .
given the long-standing nature of the hostilities , that might not be enough time .
as experience shows , fighting in the region resumed shortly after the ugandans withdrew in may . what 's more , the international peacekeeping force 's efforts will be restricted to the city of bunia , even though most inhabitants of the city have fled and much of the fighting is happening elsewhere . the international community , including germany , has approached the conflict with caution .
but the reminder of genocides in the balkans and rwanda - and the refrain " never again " - have promoted more expedient action .
whether or not it will be sufficient , remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european leaders meet as first troops arrive in congo as additional contingents of french soldiers arrive in the congo , the european union meets tuesday to determine what countries will add to the u.n. deployment .

faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
family planning programs , including pregnancy and motherhood benefits , would also be transferred out of the healthcare system and instead be covered by the federal budget – a transfer that would be financed by a previously announced , three-phase € 1 euro increase in taxes on each pack of cigarettes sold in germany .
the bill would also require a co-payment of € 15 each time a patient visited a specialist without a referral from his or her family doctor . the government also wants to establish a " center for quality in medicine , " which would determine which medical procedures and medications should be covered by public health funds .
it would establish treatment guidelines aimed at streamlining the handling of patients and , the government hopes , rein in costs .
patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .

faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
family planning programs , including pregnancy and motherhood benefits , would also be transferred out of the healthcare system and instead be covered by the federal budget – a transfer that would be financed by a previously announced , three-phase € 1 euro increase in taxes on each pack of cigarettes sold in germany .
the bill would also require a co-payment of € 15 each time a patient visited a specialist without a referral from his or her family doctor . the government also wants to establish a " center for quality in medicine , " which would determine which medical procedures and medications should be covered by public health funds .
it would establish treatment guidelines aimed at streamlining the handling of patients and , the government hopes , rein in costs .
patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .
" the people have the right to expect from us that we 're capable of compromise , " said franz müntefereing , the social democrats ' parliamentary leader . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german healthcare : cash-strapped and in need of reform following a € 3 billion cash shortfall last year , gerhard schröder is eager to bring new reforms to germany 's national healthcare system .

trichet told the press he was " moved " by the verdict that dispelled accusations that he had known the state-supported bank crédit lyonnais kept misleading accounts while he was head of the french finance ministry 's treasury department in the 1990s .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .
cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .
" we ca n't do more than help , " the chancellor said at a recent bilateral meeting with the french president jacques chirac . germany 's ambassador to the u.n. , günter pleuger , offered similar remarks .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans , " he said .
" i do n't know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now . " but high-level defense officials are also weary of the nature of the conflict , in which young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said struck . will it be enough ? wrangling over german participation aside , critics wonder if the europe-wide effort to stop the fighting in congo will be enough .
the force , composed of soldiers from belgium , spain , italy , britain and france , will number near 1,700 . but the mission itself is very limited and clearly defined : troops wo n't be dispatched until july and they are expected to return by september .
given the long-standing nature of the hostilities , that might not be enough time .
as experience shows , fighting in the region resumed shortly after the ugandans withdrew in may . what 's more , the international peacekeeping force 's efforts will be restricted to the city of bunia , even though most inhabitants of the city have fled and much of the fighting is happening elsewhere . the international community , including germany , has approached the conflict with caution .

a paris court has ended the question of who will become the next ecb president .
bank of france governor jean-claude trichet was acquitted of corruption charges on wednesday . a french court acquitted bank of france governor jean-claude trichet of complicity in a corruption scandal on wednesday .
the ruling was the last obstacle preventing the economist from taking over the reins of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- from its current president , dutchman wim duisenberg .
trichet told the press he was " moved " by the verdict that dispelled accusations that he had known the state-supported bank crédit lyonnais kept misleading accounts while he was head of the french finance ministry 's treasury department in the 1990s .
romano prodi , european union commission president , welcomed the outcome of the trial , saying it would make the change at the top of the ecb " significantly easier . "
but the french public prosecutor said he was not sure if he would appeal the verdict .
he has until july 7 to decide .
if the matter is put to rest , trichet could be officially designated the next ecb president in the coming months .
next in line trichet has been in the running for the top position since the ecb was created .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .
cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.06.2003 germany weighs difficult healthcare cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lawmakers think the public health system needs some intensive care .
faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
family planning programs , including pregnancy and motherhood benefits , would also be transferred out of the healthcare system and instead be covered by the federal budget – a transfer that would be financed by a previously announced , three-phase € 1 euro increase in taxes on each pack of cigarettes sold in germany .
the bill would also require a co-payment of € 15 each time a patient visited a specialist without a referral from his or her family doctor . the government also wants to establish a " center for quality in medicine , " which would determine which medical procedures and medications should be covered by public health funds .
it would establish treatment guidelines aimed at streamlining the handling of patients and , the government hopes , rein in costs .
patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .

faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
family planning programs , including pregnancy and motherhood benefits , would also be transferred out of the healthcare system and instead be covered by the federal budget – a transfer that would be financed by a previously announced , three-phase € 1 euro increase in taxes on each pack of cigarettes sold in germany .
the bill would also require a co-payment of € 15 each time a patient visited a specialist without a referral from his or her family doctor . the government also wants to establish a " center for quality in medicine , " which would determine which medical procedures and medications should be covered by public health funds .
it would establish treatment guidelines aimed at streamlining the handling of patients and , the government hopes , rein in costs .
patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .

" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
family planning programs , including pregnancy and motherhood benefits , would also be transferred out of the healthcare system and instead be covered by the federal budget – a transfer that would be financed by a previously announced , three-phase € 1 euro increase in taxes on each pack of cigarettes sold in germany .
the bill would also require a co-payment of € 15 each time a patient visited a specialist without a referral from his or her family doctor . the government also wants to establish a " center for quality in medicine , " which would determine which medical procedures and medications should be covered by public health funds .
it would establish treatment guidelines aimed at streamlining the handling of patients and , the government hopes , rein in costs .
patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .
" the people have the right to expect from us that we 're capable of compromise , " said franz müntefereing , the social democrats ' parliamentary leader . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german healthcare : cash-strapped and in need of reform following a € 3 billion cash shortfall last year , gerhard schröder is eager to bring new reforms to germany 's national healthcare system .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .
cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .
" we ca n't do more than help , " the chancellor said at a recent bilateral meeting with the french president jacques chirac . germany 's ambassador to the u.n. , günter pleuger , offered similar remarks .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans , " he said .
" i do n't know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now . " but high-level defense officials are also weary of the nature of the conflict , in which young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said struck . will it be enough ? wrangling over german participation aside , critics wonder if the europe-wide effort to stop the fighting in congo will be enough .
the force , composed of soldiers from belgium , spain , italy , britain and france , will number near 1,700 . but the mission itself is very limited and clearly defined : troops wo n't be dispatched until july and they are expected to return by september .
given the long-standing nature of the hostilities , that might not be enough time .
as experience shows , fighting in the region resumed shortly after the ugandans withdrew in may . what 's more , the international peacekeeping force 's efforts will be restricted to the city of bunia , even though most inhabitants of the city have fled and much of the fighting is happening elsewhere . the international community , including germany , has approached the conflict with caution .
but the reminder of genocides in the balkans and rwanda - and the refrain " never again " - have promoted more expedient action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.06.2003 germany weighs difficult healthcare cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lawmakers think the public health system needs some intensive care .
faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
family planning programs , including pregnancy and motherhood benefits , would also be transferred out of the healthcare system and instead be covered by the federal budget – a transfer that would be financed by a previously announced , three-phase € 1 euro increase in taxes on each pack of cigarettes sold in germany .
the bill would also require a co-payment of € 15 each time a patient visited a specialist without a referral from his or her family doctor . the government also wants to establish a " center for quality in medicine , " which would determine which medical procedures and medications should be covered by public health funds .
it would establish treatment guidelines aimed at streamlining the handling of patients and , the government hopes , rein in costs .
patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .

a paris court has ended the question of who will become the next ecb president .
bank of france governor jean-claude trichet was acquitted of corruption charges on wednesday . a french court acquitted bank of france governor jean-claude trichet of complicity in a corruption scandal on wednesday .
the ruling was the last obstacle preventing the economist from taking over the reins of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- from its current president , dutchman wim duisenberg .
trichet told the press he was " moved " by the verdict that dispelled accusations that he had known the state-supported bank crédit lyonnais kept misleading accounts while he was head of the french finance ministry 's treasury department in the 1990s .
romano prodi , european union commission president , welcomed the outcome of the trial , saying it would make the change at the top of the ecb " significantly easier . "

he has until july 7 to decide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.06.2003 german troops to help restore peace in congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany fears its soldiers could face child-fighters in congo .
the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .
cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .
" we ca n't do more than help , " the chancellor said at a recent bilateral meeting with the french president jacques chirac . germany 's ambassador to the u.n. , günter pleuger , offered similar remarks .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans , " he said .
" i do n't know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now . " but high-level defense officials are also weary of the nature of the conflict , in which young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said struck . will it be enough ? wrangling over german participation aside , critics wonder if the europe-wide effort to stop the fighting in congo will be enough .
the force , composed of soldiers from belgium , spain , italy , britain and france , will number near 1,700 . but the mission itself is very limited and clearly defined : troops wo n't be dispatched until july and they are expected to return by september .
given the long-standing nature of the hostilities , that might not be enough time .
as experience shows , fighting in the region resumed shortly after the ugandans withdrew in may . what 's more , the international peacekeeping force 's efforts will be restricted to the city of bunia , even though most inhabitants of the city have fled and much of the fighting is happening elsewhere . the international community , including germany , has approached the conflict with caution .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .
cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .
" we ca n't do more than help , " the chancellor said at a recent bilateral meeting with the french president jacques chirac . germany 's ambassador to the u.n. , günter pleuger , offered similar remarks .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans , " he said .
" i do n't know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now . " but high-level defense officials are also weary of the nature of the conflict , in which young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said struck . will it be enough ? wrangling over german participation aside , critics wonder if the europe-wide effort to stop the fighting in congo will be enough .
the force , composed of soldiers from belgium , spain , italy , britain and france , will number near 1,700 . but the mission itself is very limited and clearly defined : troops wo n't be dispatched until july and they are expected to return by september .
given the long-standing nature of the hostilities , that might not be enough time .
as experience shows , fighting in the region resumed shortly after the ugandans withdrew in may . what 's more , the international peacekeeping force 's efforts will be restricted to the city of bunia , even though most inhabitants of the city have fled and much of the fighting is happening elsewhere . the international community , including germany , has approached the conflict with caution .

faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
family planning programs , including pregnancy and motherhood benefits , would also be transferred out of the healthcare system and instead be covered by the federal budget – a transfer that would be financed by a previously announced , three-phase € 1 euro increase in taxes on each pack of cigarettes sold in germany .
the bill would also require a co-payment of € 15 each time a patient visited a specialist without a referral from his or her family doctor . the government also wants to establish a " center for quality in medicine , " which would determine which medical procedures and medications should be covered by public health funds .
it would establish treatment guidelines aimed at streamlining the handling of patients and , the government hopes , rein in costs .
patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .

a paris court has ended the question of who will become the next ecb president .
bank of france governor jean-claude trichet was acquitted of corruption charges on wednesday . a french court acquitted bank of france governor jean-claude trichet of complicity in a corruption scandal on wednesday .
the ruling was the last obstacle preventing the economist from taking over the reins of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- from its current president , dutchman wim duisenberg .
trichet told the press he was " moved " by the verdict that dispelled accusations that he had known the state-supported bank crédit lyonnais kept misleading accounts while he was head of the french finance ministry 's treasury department in the 1990s .
romano prodi , european union commission president , welcomed the outcome of the trial , saying it would make the change at the top of the ecb " significantly easier . "
but the french public prosecutor said he was not sure if he would appeal the verdict .
he has until july 7 to decide .
if the matter is put to rest , trichet could be officially designated the next ecb president in the coming months .
next in line trichet has been in the running for the top position since the ecb was created .
he failed to get the job the first time around due to german unease over a frenchman pulling the bank ’ s strings .
instead the euro zone countries opted for the neutral dutchman duisenberg .
but after frankfurt was selected as the ecb headquarters five years ago , france insisted that the bank 's next head should be french .
the other 11 countries in the monetary union agreed to the demands , including the appeal for duisenberg 's eight-year term to be shortened to make room for france 's choice .
thus , the stage was set for trichet , one of france 's most respected bankers .
however , the investigation , which began in 2000 , and the subsequent trial in january 2003 of trichet and eight other defendants in the crédit lyonnais scandal put a halt to a smooth succession .
in april , duisenberg announced he would postpone his retirement - which was originally set for july 9 - to wait for the next in line .

despite the accusations against trichet , the financial community has always considered him a natural choice for the top post at the ecb .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .
cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .
" we ca n't do more than help , " the chancellor said at a recent bilateral meeting with the french president jacques chirac . germany 's ambassador to the u.n. , günter pleuger , offered similar remarks .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans , " he said .
" i do n't know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now . " but high-level defense officials are also weary of the nature of the conflict , in which young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said struck . will it be enough ? wrangling over german participation aside , critics wonder if the europe-wide effort to stop the fighting in congo will be enough .
the force , composed of soldiers from belgium , spain , italy , britain and france , will number near 1,700 . but the mission itself is very limited and clearly defined : troops wo n't be dispatched until july and they are expected to return by september .
given the long-standing nature of the hostilities , that might not be enough time .
as experience shows , fighting in the region resumed shortly after the ugandans withdrew in may . what 's more , the international peacekeeping force 's efforts will be restricted to the city of bunia , even though most inhabitants of the city have fled and much of the fighting is happening elsewhere . the international community , including germany , has approached the conflict with caution .
but the reminder of genocides in the balkans and rwanda - and the refrain " never again " - have promoted more expedient action .
whether or not it will be sufficient , remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european leaders meet as first troops arrive in congo as additional contingents of french soldiers arrive in the congo , the european union meets tuesday to determine what countries will add to the u.n. deployment .

faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
family planning programs , including pregnancy and motherhood benefits , would also be transferred out of the healthcare system and instead be covered by the federal budget – a transfer that would be financed by a previously announced , three-phase € 1 euro increase in taxes on each pack of cigarettes sold in germany .
the bill would also require a co-payment of € 15 each time a patient visited a specialist without a referral from his or her family doctor . the government also wants to establish a " center for quality in medicine , " which would determine which medical procedures and medications should be covered by public health funds .
it would establish treatment guidelines aimed at streamlining the handling of patients and , the government hopes , rein in costs .
patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .

patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .

the ruling was the last obstacle preventing the economist from taking over the reins of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- from its current president , dutchman wim duisenberg .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .
cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .
" we ca n't do more than help , " the chancellor said at a recent bilateral meeting with the french president jacques chirac . germany 's ambassador to the u.n. , günter pleuger , offered similar remarks .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans , " he said .
" i do n't know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now . " but high-level defense officials are also weary of the nature of the conflict , in which young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said struck . will it be enough ? wrangling over german participation aside , critics wonder if the europe-wide effort to stop the fighting in congo will be enough .
the force , composed of soldiers from belgium , spain , italy , britain and france , will number near 1,700 . but the mission itself is very limited and clearly defined : troops wo n't be dispatched until july and they are expected to return by september .
given the long-standing nature of the hostilities , that might not be enough time .
as experience shows , fighting in the region resumed shortly after the ugandans withdrew in may . what 's more , the international peacekeeping force 's efforts will be restricted to the city of bunia , even though most inhabitants of the city have fled and much of the fighting is happening elsewhere . the international community , including germany , has approached the conflict with caution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.06.2003 germany weighs difficult healthcare cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german lawmakers think the public health system needs some intensive care .
faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .
cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .
" we ca n't do more than help , " the chancellor said at a recent bilateral meeting with the french president jacques chirac . germany 's ambassador to the u.n. , günter pleuger , offered similar remarks .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans , " he said .
" i do n't know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now . " but high-level defense officials are also weary of the nature of the conflict , in which young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said struck . will it be enough ? wrangling over german participation aside , critics wonder if the europe-wide effort to stop the fighting in congo will be enough .
the force , composed of soldiers from belgium , spain , italy , britain and france , will number near 1,700 . but the mission itself is very limited and clearly defined : troops wo n't be dispatched until july and they are expected to return by september .
given the long-standing nature of the hostilities , that might not be enough time .
as experience shows , fighting in the region resumed shortly after the ugandans withdrew in may . what 's more , the international peacekeeping force 's efforts will be restricted to the city of bunia , even though most inhabitants of the city have fled and much of the fighting is happening elsewhere . the international community , including germany , has approached the conflict with caution .

faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .

the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .
but opposition politicians fear the conflict and demands on german troops could escalate . by a clear majority vote of 441-30 , the german parliament approved the participation of german troops in the european peacekeeping force deployed to restore peace in the republic of congo on wednesday . however , the german government has mostly limited the mandate of its troops to providing air and logistical support for french troops based in neighboring uganda who are leading the peacekeeping operation . speaking to the bundestag on wednesday , defense minister peter struck said there would be no " direct " deployment of bundeswehr troops to congo unless there was an emergency or it was necessary to conduct an evacuation of european troops stationed there .
mostly , germany will supply transall and challenger military cargo planes to aid with supplies , troop transports and logistics for the french troops leading the peacekeeping mission .
germany is also providing medevac jets to transport wounded soldiers . ahead of the vote , parliamentarians expressed concerns that germany could be drawn into a long and ugly conflict . " a number of my colleagues have had a hard time giving their approval , " christian schmidt , the defense issues spokesperson for the opposition christian democratic union party , told the daily berliner zeitung .
" we are concerned that this will be the first step to a large and long-term engagement of the german military . "
despite his party 's reservations , schmidt said before the vote he was certain the mandate would be approved . a limited mandate ? the mandate approves the participation of up to 350 bundeswehr soldiers , who will be restricted to mostly support functions , assisting the peacekeeping force 's main provider of troops and leadership , france .
" mainly we will provide transport facilities to bring equipment and soldiers from germany and france to uganda , " said the german defense minister peter struck .
" and we will establish a base in uganda to provide further logistical support for european peacekeepers . "
the mandate does not foresee german soldiers engaging in combat in the congo . but some politicians fear the lines will blur too easily .
cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .
" we ca n't do more than help , " the chancellor said at a recent bilateral meeting with the french president jacques chirac . germany 's ambassador to the u.n. , günter pleuger , offered similar remarks .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans , " he said .
" i do n't know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now . " but high-level defense officials are also weary of the nature of the conflict , in which young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said struck . will it be enough ? wrangling over german participation aside , critics wonder if the europe-wide effort to stop the fighting in congo will be enough .
the force , composed of soldiers from belgium , spain , italy , britain and france , will number near 1,700 . but the mission itself is very limited and clearly defined : troops wo n't be dispatched until july and they are expected to return by september .
given the long-standing nature of the hostilities , that might not be enough time .
as experience shows , fighting in the region resumed shortly after the ugandans withdrew in may . what 's more , the international peacekeeping force 's efforts will be restricted to the city of bunia , even though most inhabitants of the city have fled and much of the fighting is happening elsewhere . the international community , including germany , has approached the conflict with caution .

faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
family planning programs , including pregnancy and motherhood benefits , would also be transferred out of the healthcare system and instead be covered by the federal budget – a transfer that would be financed by a previously announced , three-phase € 1 euro increase in taxes on each pack of cigarettes sold in germany .
the bill would also require a co-payment of € 15 each time a patient visited a specialist without a referral from his or her family doctor . the government also wants to establish a " center for quality in medicine , " which would determine which medical procedures and medications should be covered by public health funds .
it would establish treatment guidelines aimed at streamlining the handling of patients and , the government hopes , rein in costs .
patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .

cdu politicians expressed concerned about a specific clause in the mandate , which would allow the dispatch of german troops on congo soil " in an emergency and to assist with evacuation . "
for some , said schmidt , this clause was too abstract , and could lead to a more wide-spread participation of german troops , placing them in harm 's way lengthening the period of german involvement . a controversial decision german politicians have been embroiled in a debate over whether or not - and to what extent - germany should join the international community and their european neighbors in responding to the events in congo .
the situation there , in which the lendu and hema militias have been fighting each other in a bitter ethnic conflict , deteriorated in may , after the ugandan peacekeeping force withdrew .
it has been estimated that more than 400 people have been killed in the latest round of conflict . in may , united nations secretary general kofi annan , fearing a repeat of the events in rwanda , sent an official request to the eu , asking them to put together an emergency peacekeeping force .
although the eu foreign policy chief javier solana reacted favourably , and the french agreed to take on the leadership role and provide the bulk of the troops , the initial reaction from berlin was cool . sighting existing international commitments elsewhere - germany currently provides more than 8,000 troops to the balkans and afghanistan - chancellor gerhard schröder stated that germany 's efforts would be limited .
" we ca n't do more than help , " the chancellor said at a recent bilateral meeting with the french president jacques chirac . germany 's ambassador to the u.n. , günter pleuger , offered similar remarks .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans , " he said .
" i do n't know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now . " but high-level defense officials are also weary of the nature of the conflict , in which young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said struck . will it be enough ? wrangling over german participation aside , critics wonder if the europe-wide effort to stop the fighting in congo will be enough .
the force , composed of soldiers from belgium , spain , italy , britain and france , will number near 1,700 . but the mission itself is very limited and clearly defined : troops wo n't be dispatched until july and they are expected to return by september .
given the long-standing nature of the hostilities , that might not be enough time .
as experience shows , fighting in the region resumed shortly after the ugandans withdrew in may . what 's more , the international peacekeeping force 's efforts will be restricted to the city of bunia , even though most inhabitants of the city have fled and much of the fighting is happening elsewhere . the international community , including germany , has approached the conflict with caution .
but the reminder of genocides in the balkans and rwanda - and the refrain " never again " - have promoted more expedient action .
whether or not it will be sufficient , remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european leaders meet as first troops arrive in congo as additional contingents of french soldiers arrive in the congo , the european union meets tuesday to determine what countries will add to the u.n. deployment .

faced with soaring treatment costs , climbing premiums and a ballooning federal deficit , germany set off on a course to give its public health system some legislative lyposuction on wednesday . germany has long been famous for its modern , efficient and generous healthcare – a system that has served as a model for other countries .
but with staggering costs and soaring federal deficit spending , the government introduced legislation on wednesday that would drastically cut back the services covered by the country 's public health funds .
" better quality , more efficiency and more transparency is the philosophy of our new bill , " german social minister ulla schmidt told parliament , saying a massive overhaul of public health care was required in order to ensure that every german – regardless how old or how much they have in their wallet – continued to have access to germany 's national healthcare system .
" security and affordability are the two pillars of our healthcare reform , " she said .
lower payments , fewer services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt schmidt said the government 's 400-page reform package would reduce the overhead of public health care funds by billions of euros each year while at the same time reducing the healthcare premium payment to 13 percent of a person 's gross income .
among the key changes the legislation contains is the elimination of the government 's so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany 's public health funds cover an employee 's wages for up to six weeks .
under the new law , people would be required to take out separate policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
family planning programs , including pregnancy and motherhood benefits , would also be transferred out of the healthcare system and instead be covered by the federal budget – a transfer that would be financed by a previously announced , three-phase € 1 euro increase in taxes on each pack of cigarettes sold in germany .
the bill would also require a co-payment of € 15 each time a patient visited a specialist without a referral from his or her family doctor . the government also wants to establish a " center for quality in medicine , " which would determine which medical procedures and medications should be covered by public health funds .
it would establish treatment guidelines aimed at streamlining the handling of patients and , the government hopes , rein in costs .
patients would also have to dig deeper in their pockets for expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures , which would also be dropped by health plans .
balanced , but bitter pills speaking on german public radio wednesday morning , the social democrat 's parliamentary spokesman on health issues , klaus kirchner , said the package included " a few bitter pills " to swallow , but also said it was " well-balanced . "
even if passed by the bundestag , most of the elements in schmidt 's bill require approval from the bundesrat , germany 's upper legislative chamber , where the opposition christian democrats hold a solid majority .
they have also proposed their own reform plan – one that , in some areas at least , calls for even deeper cuts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel 's plan would require patients to pay 10 percent of the health costs they incur each year , or up to a total of 2 percent of their annual wages .
it would also require patients to take out private insurance policies for dentures .
merkel said her proposal , like schmidt 's , would reduce premiums to 13 percent .
but the federal government , controlled by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has rejected merkel 's proposal , saying it was equivalent to dismantling the country 's social system .
the cdu chairwoman 's counterproposal has also driven a wedge between christian democrats .
horst seehofer , the christian democratic union 's spokesman on healthcare issues has refused to support his own party 's proposal and is not expected to speak in the bundestag on wednesday .
critics of the government 's reform bill say it wo n't go far enough .
jürgen donges , the former head of the government 's prestigious panel of economic advisors , told the berliner zeitung newspaper : " wishful thinking is being glorified as reality . "
donges said the government had failed to prove its claims that the reforms would actually save the promised € 8.5 billion .
" nobody can deliver " serious estimates of the savings effects reform would have on the public health funds , he warned .
instead , donges said germans needed to take more personal responsibility for cutting costs in the health care system .
" if a patient can see and feel what a visit to the doctor actually costs , then he 'll behave a lot more reasonably , " he said .
but both the social democrats and the christian democrats have pledged to work together in the coming weeks to forge a common position that would survive a bundestag vote .

bank of france governor jean-claude trichet was acquitted of corruption charges on wednesday . a french court acquitted bank of france governor jean-claude trichet of complicity in a corruption scandal on wednesday .
the ruling was the last obstacle preventing the economist from taking over the reins of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- from its current president , dutchman wim duisenberg .

starring rosamund pike and william hootkins , the play shifts between 1919 , 1959 and 1999 ; it 's been described as dark and deep , and touches on the relationships of dysfunctional men and younger women .
we talked to them live on this morning 's programme click here to watch our interview in full with william hootkins and rosamund pike the play is about the search for the true hitchcock , and the three plots interweave : in 1999 we see a middle aged university lecturer luring a student to a greek island to restore a lost hitchcock film .
go back in time to 1959 and we see hitchcock himself scrutinising janet leigh 's body double -lrb- played by pike -rrb- in psycho .
eventually the plot takes the audience to 1919 and a recreation of a lost hitchcock film that explores the film maker 's obsession with blonde women .
along the way , the complex plot takes in diverse themes including relationships , hilarious observations on the fifty-something generation , as well as dodgy tourists and snobbery in the british film industry .
rosamund pike it was pike 's role as bond girl miranda frost in die another day that undoubtedly raised the actresses profile .
as a result , she was inundated with requests for photo shoots and had top designers like armani and gucci queuing up to supply her with outfits .
she won best newcomer at the empire film awards in february and shortly after was signed up to do hitchcock blonde at the royal court theatre where the stage production started out .
it 's proved to be a demanding role in which have tested her acting skills - the play involves full nudity , murder and in one scene she has to carry a 12 stone man on stage .
in one interview for a newspaper , she talked about her character in hitchcock blonde .
" my character is a small-town dreamer , " she explains .
" and those dreams are ones everybody shares , that you can be rescued from wherever you 've ended up . "
she goes on to say how her character meets prince charming in the form of a famous director but how he turns out to be a toad .
william hootkins attended st. marks , where he was a member of the same theatre group as ' tommy lee ' jones .

the decision to slap a 45 % tariff on memory chips from financially troubled vendor hynix comes at the behest of us manufacturer micron , which alleged that the south korean government was unfairly subsidising the company 's exports .
vietnam 's catfish growers are also in the firing line for allegedly " dumping " the fish fillets - exporting below cost or below the price on the home market - in what will be the first test of a us-vietnam trade pact signed 18 months ago .
both countries are protesting vociferously .
south korea says it will go to the world trade organisation over the tariffs , and hynix chief executive ej woo called the the us action " unjustified and illegal " .
and vietnam insists that its catfish are cheaper simply because costs are much lower there than in the us .
one on one while the wto 's global trade talks remain bogged down , not least because the european union , the us and japan are unwilling to get rid of huge agricultural tariffs , us trade negotiators have been pushing hard for bilateral deals to open up foreign markets to us exporters .
the vietnam deal is only one of a chain of similar pacts with countries from chile to singapore .
tuesday 's actions come just 24 hours after the us 's international trade commission backed a complaint from a tennessee tv maker that tvs made in china were being dumped on the us market , imposing an 84 % tariff .
similarly , malaysian manufacturers are facing a tariff of 46 % .
in the meantime , the us 's own actions have come in for criticism in recent years .
since coming into office in jaunary 2001 , the administration of president george w bush has introduced swingeing tariffs on foreign steel - albeit with broad-based exemptions - and has upped agricultural subsidies by more than $ 60bn .

the four riker 's island guards were charged on tuesday with taking the artwork during an unscheduled fire drill .
the prosecution says the men believed they could sell it for $ 1million .
all four have pleaded innocent to grand larceny .
a lawyer for one of the men says an audio tape that is a key part of the prosecution case does not prove the guards ' guilt .
the men have been named as benny nuzzo , 49 , and mitchell hochhauser , 40 - whom the prosecution believes were the ringleaders - and timothy pina , 44 , and greg sokol , 38 , who were stationed near the sketch .
they have all been suspended without pay .
if convicted , they face a maximum of 15 years in prison .
dali drew the picture by way of an apology for missing an art lesson he was supposed to give at the prison in 1965 .
moved for safety the drawing , a surrealist image of jesus being crucified , hung in the prison cafeteria for years before being moved to a lobby where officials thought it would be safer .
riker 's island 's roughly 15,000 prisoners do not have access to the lobby , which is used only by prison personnel .
" who knew that it might have been safer left in the cafeteria ? " a spokesman for new york mayor michael bloomberg asked .
in a vanishing act echoing the film the thomas crown affair , the picture was stolen in march from its usual position and replaced with a replica - despite a 24-hour guard in the lobby .
the original , last valued at $ 175,000 back in 1985 , is believed to have at least tripled in value since dali died in 1989 .
according to the new york post , one of the prison 's officers noticed that the image in the locked display case where the picture was housed " did n't look right " .
several more officers examined the picture and , having drawn the conclusion that something was amiss , called the police .
dali drew the sketch as an apology to anna moscowitz kross , then the corrections commissioner , after he was unable to attend a talk on art for the prisoners at riker 's because he was sick .
he dashed out the picture in just two hours and despatched a friend to deliver it .
on the corner he had written " for the dinning room of the prisoners rikers ysland -lsb- sic -rsb- - sd " .

according to the new york post , one of the prison 's officers noticed that the image in the locked display case where the picture was housed " did n't look right " .
several more officers examined the picture and , having drawn the conclusion that something was amiss , called the police .
dali drew the sketch as an apology to anna moscowitz kross , then the corrections commissioner , after he was unable to attend a talk on art for the prisoners at riker 's because he was sick .
he dashed out the picture in just two hours and despatched a friend to deliver it .
on the corner he had written " for the dinning room of the prisoners rikers ysland -lsb- sic -rsb- - sd " .
and there it hung for 16 years until it was re-housed in the jail 's lobby .

mr trichet is the anointed successor to current european central bank president wim duisenberg , who is set to step down on 9 july .
but that could all change at around 1130 gmt if judge olivier perusset rules that mr trichet is guilty of complicity in allegedly hiding losses at then state-owned bank credit lyonnais in the early 1990s .
a guilty verdict would make it very difficult for him to take over from mr duisenberg , who controls the eurozone 's monetary policy .
coverup ?
mr trichet , 60 , is one of nine men on trial for their part in the credit lyonnais fiasco , which culminated in a 31bn-euro -lrb- $ 33.7bn -rrb- bailout by the government .
one of france 's biggest banks , credit lyonnais ran into serious trouble following a series of disastrous investments in the late 1980s and early 1990s .
in 1992 and the first half of 1993 , the bank 's financial situation was so dire that its very solvency was in doubt .
official accounts signed off by mr trichet , however , did not reflect this .
' plan b ' mr trichet says he was deceived by credit lyonnais , and was never part of a cover-up .
under a deal struck by french president jacques chirac and other eu leaders at a stormy summit in 1998 , mr trichet was chosen to replace mr duisenberg - who plans to stand down next month .
few doubt that the bank of france governor is qualified for the job of ecb president .
he is a highly-respected central banker who oversaw france 's strong franc policy in the 1990s .
but in the event of the nightmare scenario - a guilty verdict - there are few candidates ready to fill mr duisenberg 's shoes .
" the big dilemma is who else would be possible , " said rainer guntermann of dresdner kleinwort benson .
" what 's plan b ? "

both she and fellow ex-minister robin cook , who also quit the cabinet over iraq , told the committee that government claims about the threat posed by saddam hussein 's regime in the build-up to war had been exaggerated .
