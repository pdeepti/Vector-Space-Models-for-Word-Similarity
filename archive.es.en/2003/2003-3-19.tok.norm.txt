but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ? chancellor schröder somberly addressed the nation on march 24 , 1999 , shortly after nato began bombing yugoslavia .
he announced that his government had made a difficult decision .
" after all , this is the first time since world war ii that german soldiers have been deployed in combat , " he said .
" we are not waging a war , but we must bring about a peaceful solution in kosovo , even if that requires the use of military force . "
schröder explained that this was the reason why the german government had decided to take part in the military campaign against slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today , the same governing coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected involvement in a war against iraq , arguing that military intervention would only serve to further destabilize the middle east .
in 1999 , the government used the opposite argument , maintaining that the balkans would be in greater danger if germany did not act .
explaining the contradiction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr on parade .
" in kosovo , we had a situation of ongoing danger , " social democratic party foreign policy spokeswoman ute zapf told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it was about ethnic expulsion and impending genocide .
now , in iraq , we have a potential threat from iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no immediate danger . "
zapf insisted the problems were very different .
germany 's opposition parties hold a different view .
christoph schmidt , defense spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , criticized the government for committing itself too early to a " no " vote on participation in order to assure shröder 's autumn reelection bid last year .
now , schmidt says , schröder has no maneuvering room to change his position .
" july 2002 was the point of departure , " schmidt explains .
" then schröder tried to take advantage of the mood against military intervention -lrb- in iraq -rrb- for the election campaign .
the price was that other foreign policy options were abandoned .
and now , getting out of that without losing face is hard . "
political perspectives günther joetze believes that neither of these explanations is sufficient .
the former president of the federal academy for security policy has written a book about germany 's role in the kosovo conflict and is working on a new book about its role in the iraq crisis .
joetze ascribes the german government 's differing attitudes toward kosovo and iraq to numerous motives .
above all , says joetze , the government holds different political perspectives for the two crisis regions .
in kosovo , the international community was aiming to enforce humanitarian and democratic standards , which can not be transmitted to iraq as easily , joetze maintains .
furthermore , saddam hussein is not considered the only rogue in the region , which is why the government does not believe that a war will improve the situation .
in the case of kosovo , joetze says , germany 's partners in nato expected that the german army , the bundeswehr , would take part in military operations .
the government had little choice but to say " yes , " joetze maintains .
plus , the government had only been in office for a short time and had to prove itself in the realm of foreign policy .
" the social democrats did n't want to start their term in government with discord in the coalition , " joetze insists .
" whereas , for foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the question was a different one .
it was made clear to him -lrb- as the junior partner in the governing coalition -rrb- that he could only remain foreign minister and a governing partner if he towed the same line . "

-lrb- ap photo -rrb- today , joetze says the government is in a different position - not just because it has been in office for four years , but also because germany is now the second-largest contributor of troops to international peacekeeping operations around the world .
" the defense minister and the chancellor say we continually prove ourselves to be reliable partners , " joetze says .
" we are prepared to make our contribution .
we can afford to have another opinion on one particular question . "
" -lrb- in 1999 -rrb- the only international operation the bundeswehr was involved in was the air campaign against yugoslavia .
there were n't any german troops in macedonia or afghanistan yet .
the issue was the first nato troop deployment . "
besides , the mood among the population has changed in the past four years .
then , most germans were in favor of a war against the milosevic regime .
today , the majority rejects a war against saddam hussein .
in that light , joetze defends schröder 's firm position against an iraq war .
nor does he find the anti-war stance " reprehensible , " as some members of germany 's opposition government have .

zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday . " i want to tell our friends abroad one thing : what you have begun , what the democratic party has begun , what the serbian government has begun - we wo n't change anything about that ... we wo n't change course , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but he had to put down a revolt within his own labour ranks to do so . prime minister tony blair received his much-needed parliamentary support late tuesday for british participation in a war against iraq , but he had to pay a political price in his own labour party for the victory .
with the support from the opposition , the house of commons strongly endorsed the government 's decision to use " all means necessary " to strip saddam hussein of his weapons of mass destruction .
the decision allows blair to commit the 40,000 british troops in the persian gulf in a war that could begin anytime after the deadline of 2 a.m.
central european time on thursday set by u.s. president george w. bush .
before blair could celebrate his victory , he had to put down a revolt in his own party and defeat an amendment that declared that the case for war " has not yet been established . "
on the surface , the numbers showed that blair was able to handily put down the amendment , 396 to 217 .
but 138 members of his party were among the 217 lawmakers who voted for the measure .
it was the biggest show of dissent blair has faced since coming to power in 1997 and followed a vote last month in which 122 labour lawmakers rebelled against blair 's hawkish stance .
after the first vote on tuesday , the house of commons voted 412 to 149 to approve the government 's resolve to disarm iraq .
the opposition conservatives also backed blair .
unity sought after vote following the votes , labour rebels said it was now time to unite behind blair and support british troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robin cook " i hope that the war will be over quickly , " said robin cook , a senior cabinet member who quit monday over the crisis .
" i hope it will be successful , and i hope all our troops , both the american and british , will be coming back . "
blair staked his career on the need to support military action .
" back away from this confrontation now and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects , " he said in an impassioned speech to lawmakers , as some 200 anti-war protesters demonstrated outside parliament .
blair said far more was at stake than disarming saddam - that the fundamental framework of international relations was being re-examined .
" it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century , " he said .
" it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation . "
he made the impassioned plea to parliament in an effort to shore up his slipping support within his party .
as a result of these protests , two senior cabinet ministers have quit the british government , and a midlevel cabinet minister has resigned as well .
amid the gloom , blair was able to win one small victory .
clare short , britain 's international development secretary , changed her mind about possibly resigning if the prime minister went to war without u.n. backing .
tuesday 's debate was called after the united states , britain and spain withdrew their second resolution in the u.n. security council on sunday and bush gave saddam 48 hours to leave iraq on monday evening .
three u.k. cabinet ministers resign the resignations began on monday with cook -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the house of commons .
junior health minister lord philip hunt and john denham , a mid-ranking british interior minister , followed on tuesday .
in his resignation letter , former foreign secretary cook wrote : " in principle , i believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support . "
he said he believed british " interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . "
cook received a standing ovation for the resignation speech he gave to a packed house of commons .
the next morning , hunt said in an interview on bbc radio 4 that he had " decided to resign from the government today because i don ’ t support the pre-emptive action which is going to be taken without broad international support or indeed the support of the british people . "
a handful of lower-level labour party officials also tendered their resignations on tuesday .
motion questions iraqi compliance the british parliamentarians were considering a motion that stated that iraq had not complied fully with weapons inspectors and is in material breach of u.n. resolution 1441 , the latest resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
therefore , the motion continued , the british government should " use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction . "
on monday , the british government 's top lawyer , attorney general lord goldsmith , said war without a second u.n. resolution would not break international law .
previous u.n. resolutions were sufficient to authorize the use of force against iraq , he said .
a new poll showed that public support for a war against iraq had risen slightly .
disapproval for war fell 8 percentage points to 44 percent , and support rose 9 percentage points to 38 percent .
the icm poll , published in the guardian newspaper on tuesday , said the iraq crisis had not affected labour ’ s poll rating and suggested that the blair " might have gone through the worst and his determination to secure a second u.n. resolution , though unsuccessful , has impressed voters .

as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .

but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states .
bush aide sees ' many unknowns ' " on the brink of war with iraq , americans should be prepared for what we hope will be as precise , short a conflict as possible , but there are many unknowns and it could be a matter of some duration , " white house press secretary ari fleischer said .
" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .
in ankara , turkey , the new government there also made plans to help the united states conduct the war .
it scheduled a parliamentary vote for thursday on the issue of allowing the united states to use turkish airspace during the attack .
such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .
that request was rejected by the parliament on march 1 , and the decision cost the country at least $ 6 billion in aid .
germans bolster security for americans in germany , the government of gerhard schröder stepped up its security force guarding u.s. facilities in the country from 2,500 soldiers to 3,700 , defense secretary peter struck said on tuesday evening .
but struck rejected a request from the state of baden-württemberg that troops should also be assigned to protect american shopping and housing areas in the country .
the minister said such patrols were the job of police officers .
interior minister otto schily suggested that the war would increase the threat of terrorism in germany .
" the terror network al qaida will mostly react to the war by increasing its terror activities and use it for propaganda purposes , " schily said in a television interview .
" we also have to expect that there will be so-called spontaneous terrorists from the extremist , fundamentalist islamic scene . "
but rolf tophoven , a terrorism reseacher in bonn , said he thought the chances of germany 's becoming a terror target would be small .
" the danger comes from attacks carried out by unknown fanatical individual terrorists , " tophoven said .

such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2003 russia , germany , france criticize united states on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in session : the u.n. security council unanimously approved a new iraq resolution last november .
as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .
fischer sees ' no alternative ' to u.n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the security council .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states .
bush aide sees ' many unknowns ' " on the brink of war with iraq , americans should be prepared for what we hope will be as precise , short a conflict as possible , but there are many unknowns and it could be a matter of some duration , " white house press secretary ari fleischer said .
" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .

british prime minister tony blair won his vote in parliament late tuesday .
but he had to put down a revolt within his own labour ranks to do so . prime minister tony blair received his much-needed parliamentary support late tuesday for british participation in a war against iraq , but he had to pay a political price in his own labour party for the victory .
with the support from the opposition , the house of commons strongly endorsed the government 's decision to use " all means necessary " to strip saddam hussein of his weapons of mass destruction .
the decision allows blair to commit the 40,000 british troops in the persian gulf in a war that could begin anytime after the deadline of 2 a.m.
central european time on thursday set by u.s. president george w. bush .
before blair could celebrate his victory , he had to put down a revolt in his own party and defeat an amendment that declared that the case for war " has not yet been established . "
on the surface , the numbers showed that blair was able to handily put down the amendment , 396 to 217 .
but 138 members of his party were among the 217 lawmakers who voted for the measure .
it was the biggest show of dissent blair has faced since coming to power in 1997 and followed a vote last month in which 122 labour lawmakers rebelled against blair 's hawkish stance .
after the first vote on tuesday , the house of commons voted 412 to 149 to approve the government 's resolve to disarm iraq .
the opposition conservatives also backed blair .
unity sought after vote following the votes , labour rebels said it was now time to unite behind blair and support british troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robin cook " i hope that the war will be over quickly , " said robin cook , a senior cabinet member who quit monday over the crisis .
" i hope it will be successful , and i hope all our troops , both the american and british , will be coming back . "
blair staked his career on the need to support military action .
" back away from this confrontation now and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects , " he said in an impassioned speech to lawmakers , as some 200 anti-war protesters demonstrated outside parliament .
blair said far more was at stake than disarming saddam - that the fundamental framework of international relations was being re-examined .
" it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century , " he said .
" it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation . "
he made the impassioned plea to parliament in an effort to shore up his slipping support within his party .
as a result of these protests , two senior cabinet ministers have quit the british government , and a midlevel cabinet minister has resigned as well .
amid the gloom , blair was able to win one small victory .
clare short , britain 's international development secretary , changed her mind about possibly resigning if the prime minister went to war without u.n. backing .
tuesday 's debate was called after the united states , britain and spain withdrew their second resolution in the u.n. security council on sunday and bush gave saddam 48 hours to leave iraq on monday evening .
three u.k. cabinet ministers resign the resignations began on monday with cook -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the house of commons .
junior health minister lord philip hunt and john denham , a mid-ranking british interior minister , followed on tuesday .
in his resignation letter , former foreign secretary cook wrote : " in principle , i believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support . "
he said he believed british " interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . "
cook received a standing ovation for the resignation speech he gave to a packed house of commons .
the next morning , hunt said in an interview on bbc radio 4 that he had " decided to resign from the government today because i don ’ t support the pre-emptive action which is going to be taken without broad international support or indeed the support of the british people . "
a handful of lower-level labour party officials also tendered their resignations on tuesday .
motion questions iraqi compliance the british parliamentarians were considering a motion that stated that iraq had not complied fully with weapons inspectors and is in material breach of u.n. resolution 1441 , the latest resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
therefore , the motion continued , the british government should " use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction . "
on monday , the british government 's top lawyer , attorney general lord goldsmith , said war without a second u.n. resolution would not break international law .
previous u.n. resolutions were sufficient to authorize the use of force against iraq , he said .
a new poll showed that public support for a war against iraq had risen slightly .
disapproval for war fell 8 percentage points to 44 percent , and support rose 9 percentage points to 38 percent .
the icm poll , published in the guardian newspaper on tuesday , said the iraq crisis had not affected labour ’ s poll rating and suggested that the blair " might have gone through the worst and his determination to secure a second u.n. resolution , though unsuccessful , has impressed voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.03.2003 new serbian leader pledges further reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb prime minister zivkovic -lrb- left -rrb- with a photo of slain pm djindjic .
zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday . " i want to tell our friends abroad one thing : what you have begun , what the democratic party has begun , what the serbian government has begun - we wo n't change anything about that ... we wo n't change course , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but the country 's opposition parties back bush . in a national address , chancellor gerhard schröder said on tuesday morning that he steadfastly opposed president george w. bush 's just announced ultimatum to iraqi leader saddam hussein and the war that the demand could trigger .
" my question was and remains : does the size of the threat posed by the iraqi dictator justify a decision to wage a war that will surely lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent children , women and men ?
my answer to this question was and remains : no , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush schröder made his television address eight hours after u.s. president george w. bush -lrb- photo -rrb- gave saddam 48 hours to leave his country and told americans that a military confrontation would ultimately make them safer .
" the security of the world requires disarming saddam hussein now , " bush said .
division between americans and germans the issue of war against iraq has driven a wedge between the united states and germany , two allies whose relationship was tightly bound together during four decades of cold war and the reunification of west germany and east germany that followed in 1990 .
schröder began criticizing bush 's plans for a war during the summer as he campaigned for re-election .
as part of his stump speeches , schröder said german troops would not participate in such a war .
he intensified that opposition in january , when he announced that germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
during the address on tuesday , schröder reiterated one position he took during much of the debate .
" iraq is a country that is being extensively inspected by the united nations , " he said .
" the disarmament steps that the security council has demanded are being increasingly implemented .
therefore , there is no reason to break off this process of disarmament . "
schröder delivered the roughly five-minute address while sitting at a desk with his hands folded in front of him .
at his back was a large office window framed by the german and european flags to his right and a plant to his left .
outside on this hazy morning , traffic rolled along a road located not far from the home of the german parliament , the reichstag .
the chancellor concluded the address by pledging to continue to work for peace and security .
" you can be assured that my government will steadfastly use every chance , no matter how small , to achieve world peace .
you can also be assured that we will take every possible measure to ensure security in our country , " he said .
opposition parties back u.s. unlike schröder , germany 's major opposition parties endorsed the course set by bush .
" we regret that the use of military force has become more likely and that the u.n. security council was unable to reach a unified position on the question of completely and unconditionally disarming iraq , even though it unanimously determined that a threat to world peace existed , " a statement said .
the statement was passed on tuesday with only four negative votes by the combined parliamentary groups of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the pending war against saddam 's regime raises a parliamentary question for schröder .
despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .
poles , australians to provide troops in contrast , bush gained the support of other countries after the speech .
poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .
" u.s. president bush has conducted a major undertaking in his search for international support , " koizumi said .
" and in this sense , i think he has made an inevitable decision . "

erdogan said the country 's parliament would reconsider the matter on wednesday or thursday .
the parliament voted on march 1 against allowing the united states to station a force of 62,000 troops who could have invaded iraq across the turkish border .

despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .
poles , australians to provide troops in contrast , bush gained the support of other countries after the speech .
poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .
" u.s. president bush has conducted a major undertaking in his search for international support , " koizumi said .
" and in this sense , i think he has made an inevitable decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan turkey 's new prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , also took a step on tuesday toward possible support of the u.s. military .
erdogan said the country 's parliament would reconsider the matter on wednesday or thursday .
the parliament voted on march 1 against allowing the united states to station a force of 62,000 troops who could have invaded iraq across the turkish border .
details about the new plan were not released .
they could include the use of turkish air space during a war , the admission of elite u.s. troops or the old proposal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war could spell doom for iraq 's children in the face of a possible u.s.-led war in iraq , the head of unicef germany has warned of dramatic consequences , especially for millions of iraqi children , thousands of whom are already severely undernourished .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2003 blair wins fight to join u.s.-led war against iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pleading for support : britain 's prime minister tony blair addresses the house of commons on tuesday .
british prime minister tony blair won his vote in parliament late tuesday .
but he had to put down a revolt within his own labour ranks to do so . prime minister tony blair received his much-needed parliamentary support late tuesday for british participation in a war against iraq , but he had to pay a political price in his own labour party for the victory .
with the support from the opposition , the house of commons strongly endorsed the government 's decision to use " all means necessary " to strip saddam hussein of his weapons of mass destruction .
the decision allows blair to commit the 40,000 british troops in the persian gulf in a war that could begin anytime after the deadline of 2 a.m.
central european time on thursday set by u.s. president george w. bush .
before blair could celebrate his victory , he had to put down a revolt in his own party and defeat an amendment that declared that the case for war " has not yet been established . "
on the surface , the numbers showed that blair was able to handily put down the amendment , 396 to 217 .
but 138 members of his party were among the 217 lawmakers who voted for the measure .
it was the biggest show of dissent blair has faced since coming to power in 1997 and followed a vote last month in which 122 labour lawmakers rebelled against blair 's hawkish stance .
after the first vote on tuesday , the house of commons voted 412 to 149 to approve the government 's resolve to disarm iraq .
the opposition conservatives also backed blair .
unity sought after vote following the votes , labour rebels said it was now time to unite behind blair and support british troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robin cook " i hope that the war will be over quickly , " said robin cook , a senior cabinet member who quit monday over the crisis .
" i hope it will be successful , and i hope all our troops , both the american and british , will be coming back . "
blair staked his career on the need to support military action .
" back away from this confrontation now and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects , " he said in an impassioned speech to lawmakers , as some 200 anti-war protesters demonstrated outside parliament .
blair said far more was at stake than disarming saddam - that the fundamental framework of international relations was being re-examined .
" it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century , " he said .
" it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation . "
he made the impassioned plea to parliament in an effort to shore up his slipping support within his party .
as a result of these protests , two senior cabinet ministers have quit the british government , and a midlevel cabinet minister has resigned as well .
amid the gloom , blair was able to win one small victory .
clare short , britain 's international development secretary , changed her mind about possibly resigning if the prime minister went to war without u.n. backing .
tuesday 's debate was called after the united states , britain and spain withdrew their second resolution in the u.n. security council on sunday and bush gave saddam 48 hours to leave iraq on monday evening .
three u.k. cabinet ministers resign the resignations began on monday with cook -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the house of commons .
junior health minister lord philip hunt and john denham , a mid-ranking british interior minister , followed on tuesday .
in his resignation letter , former foreign secretary cook wrote : " in principle , i believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support . "
he said he believed british " interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . "
cook received a standing ovation for the resignation speech he gave to a packed house of commons .
the next morning , hunt said in an interview on bbc radio 4 that he had " decided to resign from the government today because i don ’ t support the pre-emptive action which is going to be taken without broad international support or indeed the support of the british people . "
a handful of lower-level labour party officials also tendered their resignations on tuesday .
motion questions iraqi compliance the british parliamentarians were considering a motion that stated that iraq had not complied fully with weapons inspectors and is in material breach of u.n. resolution 1441 , the latest resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
therefore , the motion continued , the british government should " use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction . "
on monday , the british government 's top lawyer , attorney general lord goldsmith , said war without a second u.n. resolution would not break international law .
previous u.n. resolutions were sufficient to authorize the use of force against iraq , he said .
a new poll showed that public support for a war against iraq had risen slightly .
disapproval for war fell 8 percentage points to 44 percent , and support rose 9 percentage points to 38 percent .
the icm poll , published in the guardian newspaper on tuesday , said the iraq crisis had not affected labour ’ s poll rating and suggested that the blair " might have gone through the worst and his determination to secure a second u.n. resolution , though unsuccessful , has impressed voters .

but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ? chancellor schröder somberly addressed the nation on march 24 , 1999 , shortly after nato began bombing yugoslavia .
he announced that his government had made a difficult decision .
" after all , this is the first time since world war ii that german soldiers have been deployed in combat , " he said .
" we are not waging a war , but we must bring about a peaceful solution in kosovo , even if that requires the use of military force . "
schröder explained that this was the reason why the german government had decided to take part in the military campaign against slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today , the same governing coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected involvement in a war against iraq , arguing that military intervention would only serve to further destabilize the middle east .
in 1999 , the government used the opposite argument , maintaining that the balkans would be in greater danger if germany did not act .
explaining the contradiction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr on parade .
" in kosovo , we had a situation of ongoing danger , " social democratic party foreign policy spokeswoman ute zapf told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it was about ethnic expulsion and impending genocide .
now , in iraq , we have a potential threat from iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no immediate danger . "
zapf insisted the problems were very different .
germany 's opposition parties hold a different view .
christoph schmidt , defense spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , criticized the government for committing itself too early to a " no " vote on participation in order to assure shröder 's autumn reelection bid last year .
now , schmidt says , schröder has no maneuvering room to change his position .
" july 2002 was the point of departure , " schmidt explains .
" then schröder tried to take advantage of the mood against military intervention -lrb- in iraq -rrb- for the election campaign .
the price was that other foreign policy options were abandoned .
and now , getting out of that without losing face is hard . "
political perspectives günther joetze believes that neither of these explanations is sufficient .
the former president of the federal academy for security policy has written a book about germany 's role in the kosovo conflict and is working on a new book about its role in the iraq crisis .
joetze ascribes the german government 's differing attitudes toward kosovo and iraq to numerous motives .
above all , says joetze , the government holds different political perspectives for the two crisis regions .
in kosovo , the international community was aiming to enforce humanitarian and democratic standards , which can not be transmitted to iraq as easily , joetze maintains .
furthermore , saddam hussein is not considered the only rogue in the region , which is why the government does not believe that a war will improve the situation .
in the case of kosovo , joetze says , germany 's partners in nato expected that the german army , the bundeswehr , would take part in military operations .
the government had little choice but to say " yes , " joetze maintains .
plus , the government had only been in office for a short time and had to prove itself in the realm of foreign policy .
" the social democrats did n't want to start their term in government with discord in the coalition , " joetze insists .
" whereas , for foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the question was a different one .
it was made clear to him -lrb- as the junior partner in the governing coalition -rrb- that he could only remain foreign minister and a governing partner if he towed the same line . "

-lrb- ap photo -rrb- today , joetze says the government is in a different position - not just because it has been in office for four years , but also because germany is now the second-largest contributor of troops to international peacekeeping operations around the world .
" the defense minister and the chancellor say we continually prove ourselves to be reliable partners , " joetze says .
" we are prepared to make our contribution .
we can afford to have another opinion on one particular question . "
" -lrb- in 1999 -rrb- the only international operation the bundeswehr was involved in was the air campaign against yugoslavia .
there were n't any german troops in macedonia or afghanistan yet .
the issue was the first nato troop deployment . "
besides , the mood among the population has changed in the past four years .
then , most germans were in favor of a war against the milosevic regime .
today , the majority rejects a war against saddam hussein .
in that light , joetze defends schröder 's firm position against an iraq war .

zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday . " i want to tell our friends abroad one thing : what you have begun , what the democratic party has begun , what the serbian government has begun - we wo n't change anything about that ... we wo n't change course , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday . " i want to tell our friends abroad one thing : what you have begun , what the democratic party has begun , what the serbian government has begun - we wo n't change anything about that ... we wo n't change course , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" the security of the world requires disarming saddam hussein now , " bush said .
division between americans and germans the issue of war against iraq has driven a wedge between the united states and germany , two allies whose relationship was tightly bound together during four decades of cold war and the reunification of west germany and east germany that followed in 1990 .
schröder began criticizing bush 's plans for a war during the summer as he campaigned for re-election .
as part of his stump speeches , schröder said german troops would not participate in such a war .
he intensified that opposition in january , when he announced that germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
during the address on tuesday , schröder reiterated one position he took during much of the debate .
" iraq is a country that is being extensively inspected by the united nations , " he said .
" the disarmament steps that the security council has demanded are being increasingly implemented .
therefore , there is no reason to break off this process of disarmament . "
schröder delivered the roughly five-minute address while sitting at a desk with his hands folded in front of him .
at his back was a large office window framed by the german and european flags to his right and a plant to his left .
outside on this hazy morning , traffic rolled along a road located not far from the home of the german parliament , the reichstag .
the chancellor concluded the address by pledging to continue to work for peace and security .
" you can be assured that my government will steadfastly use every chance , no matter how small , to achieve world peace .
you can also be assured that we will take every possible measure to ensure security in our country , " he said .
opposition parties back u.s. unlike schröder , germany 's major opposition parties endorsed the course set by bush .
" we regret that the use of military force has become more likely and that the u.n. security council was unable to reach a unified position on the question of completely and unconditionally disarming iraq , even though it unanimously determined that a threat to world peace existed , " a statement said .
the statement was passed on tuesday with only four negative votes by the combined parliamentary groups of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the pending war against saddam 's regime raises a parliamentary question for schröder .
despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .
poles , australians to provide troops in contrast , bush gained the support of other countries after the speech .
poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .
" u.s. president bush has conducted a major undertaking in his search for international support , " koizumi said .
" and in this sense , i think he has made an inevitable decision . "

erdogan said the country 's parliament would reconsider the matter on wednesday or thursday .
the parliament voted on march 1 against allowing the united states to station a force of 62,000 troops who could have invaded iraq across the turkish border .

british prime minister tony blair won his vote in parliament late tuesday .
but he had to put down a revolt within his own labour ranks to do so . prime minister tony blair received his much-needed parliamentary support late tuesday for british participation in a war against iraq , but he had to pay a political price in his own labour party for the victory .
with the support from the opposition , the house of commons strongly endorsed the government 's decision to use " all means necessary " to strip saddam hussein of his weapons of mass destruction .
the decision allows blair to commit the 40,000 british troops in the persian gulf in a war that could begin anytime after the deadline of 2 a.m.
central european time on thursday set by u.s. president george w. bush .
before blair could celebrate his victory , he had to put down a revolt in his own party and defeat an amendment that declared that the case for war " has not yet been established . "
on the surface , the numbers showed that blair was able to handily put down the amendment , 396 to 217 .
but 138 members of his party were among the 217 lawmakers who voted for the measure .
it was the biggest show of dissent blair has faced since coming to power in 1997 and followed a vote last month in which 122 labour lawmakers rebelled against blair 's hawkish stance .
after the first vote on tuesday , the house of commons voted 412 to 149 to approve the government 's resolve to disarm iraq .
the opposition conservatives also backed blair .
unity sought after vote following the votes , labour rebels said it was now time to unite behind blair and support british troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robin cook " i hope that the war will be over quickly , " said robin cook , a senior cabinet member who quit monday over the crisis .
" i hope it will be successful , and i hope all our troops , both the american and british , will be coming back . "
blair staked his career on the need to support military action .
" back away from this confrontation now and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects , " he said in an impassioned speech to lawmakers , as some 200 anti-war protesters demonstrated outside parliament .
blair said far more was at stake than disarming saddam - that the fundamental framework of international relations was being re-examined .
" it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century , " he said .
" it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation . "
he made the impassioned plea to parliament in an effort to shore up his slipping support within his party .
as a result of these protests , two senior cabinet ministers have quit the british government , and a midlevel cabinet minister has resigned as well .
amid the gloom , blair was able to win one small victory .
clare short , britain 's international development secretary , changed her mind about possibly resigning if the prime minister went to war without u.n. backing .
tuesday 's debate was called after the united states , britain and spain withdrew their second resolution in the u.n. security council on sunday and bush gave saddam 48 hours to leave iraq on monday evening .
three u.k. cabinet ministers resign the resignations began on monday with cook -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the house of commons .
junior health minister lord philip hunt and john denham , a mid-ranking british interior minister , followed on tuesday .
in his resignation letter , former foreign secretary cook wrote : " in principle , i believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support . "
he said he believed british " interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . "
cook received a standing ovation for the resignation speech he gave to a packed house of commons .
the next morning , hunt said in an interview on bbc radio 4 that he had " decided to resign from the government today because i don ’ t support the pre-emptive action which is going to be taken without broad international support or indeed the support of the british people . "
a handful of lower-level labour party officials also tendered their resignations on tuesday .
motion questions iraqi compliance the british parliamentarians were considering a motion that stated that iraq had not complied fully with weapons inspectors and is in material breach of u.n. resolution 1441 , the latest resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
therefore , the motion continued , the british government should " use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction . "
on monday , the british government 's top lawyer , attorney general lord goldsmith , said war without a second u.n. resolution would not break international law .
previous u.n. resolutions were sufficient to authorize the use of force against iraq , he said .
a new poll showed that public support for a war against iraq had risen slightly .
disapproval for war fell 8 percentage points to 44 percent , and support rose 9 percentage points to 38 percent .
the icm poll , published in the guardian newspaper on tuesday , said the iraq crisis had not affected labour ’ s poll rating and suggested that the blair " might have gone through the worst and his determination to secure a second u.n. resolution , though unsuccessful , has impressed voters .

zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday . " i want to tell our friends abroad one thing : what you have begun , what the democratic party has begun , what the serbian government has begun - we wo n't change anything about that ... we wo n't change course , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .
fischer sees ' no alternative ' to u.n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the security council .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states .
bush aide sees ' many unknowns ' " on the brink of war with iraq , americans should be prepared for what we hope will be as precise , short a conflict as possible , but there are many unknowns and it could be a matter of some duration , " white house press secretary ari fleischer said .
" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .
in ankara , turkey , the new government there also made plans to help the united states conduct the war .
it scheduled a parliamentary vote for thursday on the issue of allowing the united states to use turkish airspace during the attack .
such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .
that request was rejected by the parliament on march 1 , and the decision cost the country at least $ 6 billion in aid .
germans bolster security for americans in germany , the government of gerhard schröder stepped up its security force guarding u.s. facilities in the country from 2,500 soldiers to 3,700 , defense secretary peter struck said on tuesday evening .
but struck rejected a request from the state of baden-württemberg that troops should also be assigned to protect american shopping and housing areas in the country .
the minister said such patrols were the job of police officers .
interior minister otto schily suggested that the war would increase the threat of terrorism in germany .
" the terror network al qaida will mostly react to the war by increasing its terror activities and use it for propaganda purposes , " schily said in a television interview .
" we also have to expect that there will be so-called spontaneous terrorists from the extremist , fundamentalist islamic scene . "
but rolf tophoven , a terrorism reseacher in bonn , said he thought the chances of germany 's becoming a terror target would be small .

as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .
fischer sees ' no alternative ' to u.n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the security council .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states .
bush aide sees ' many unknowns ' " on the brink of war with iraq , americans should be prepared for what we hope will be as precise , short a conflict as possible , but there are many unknowns and it could be a matter of some duration , " white house press secretary ari fleischer said .
" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .
in ankara , turkey , the new government there also made plans to help the united states conduct the war .
it scheduled a parliamentary vote for thursday on the issue of allowing the united states to use turkish airspace during the attack .
such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .
that request was rejected by the parliament on march 1 , and the decision cost the country at least $ 6 billion in aid .
germans bolster security for americans in germany , the government of gerhard schröder stepped up its security force guarding u.s. facilities in the country from 2,500 soldiers to 3,700 , defense secretary peter struck said on tuesday evening .
but struck rejected a request from the state of baden-württemberg that troops should also be assigned to protect american shopping and housing areas in the country .
the minister said such patrols were the job of police officers .
interior minister otto schily suggested that the war would increase the threat of terrorism in germany .
" the terror network al qaida will mostly react to the war by increasing its terror activities and use it for propaganda purposes , " schily said in a television interview .
" we also have to expect that there will be so-called spontaneous terrorists from the extremist , fundamentalist islamic scene . "
but rolf tophoven , a terrorism reseacher in bonn , said he thought the chances of germany 's becoming a terror target would be small .
" the danger comes from attacks carried out by unknown fanatical individual terrorists , " tophoven said .
" we are n't the main address for terrorists . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rejects war that will kill ' thousands ' in iraq germany 's chancellor says in a reaction to the united states ' ultimatum that the united nations should be able to continue its inspection program .
but the country 's opposition parties back bush .
-lrb- march 19 , 2003 -rrb- why germany voted ' yes ' to invade yugoslavia but ' no ' to iraq chancellor gerhard schröder has ruled out german military participation in an iraq war .
but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .

in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .

but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .

bush aide sees ' many unknowns ' " on the brink of war with iraq , americans should be prepared for what we hope will be as precise , short a conflict as possible , but there are many unknowns and it could be a matter of some duration , " white house press secretary ari fleischer said .
" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .
in ankara , turkey , the new government there also made plans to help the united states conduct the war .
it scheduled a parliamentary vote for thursday on the issue of allowing the united states to use turkish airspace during the attack .
such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .
that request was rejected by the parliament on march 1 , and the decision cost the country at least $ 6 billion in aid .
germans bolster security for americans in germany , the government of gerhard schröder stepped up its security force guarding u.s. facilities in the country from 2,500 soldiers to 3,700 , defense secretary peter struck said on tuesday evening .
but struck rejected a request from the state of baden-württemberg that troops should also be assigned to protect american shopping and housing areas in the country .
the minister said such patrols were the job of police officers .
interior minister otto schily suggested that the war would increase the threat of terrorism in germany .
" the terror network al qaida will mostly react to the war by increasing its terror activities and use it for propaganda purposes , " schily said in a television interview .
" we also have to expect that there will be so-called spontaneous terrorists from the extremist , fundamentalist islamic scene . "
but rolf tophoven , a terrorism reseacher in bonn , said he thought the chances of germany 's becoming a terror target would be small .

as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .

zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday .

but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday . " i want to tell our friends abroad one thing : what you have begun , what the democratic party has begun , what the serbian government has begun - we wo n't change anything about that ... we wo n't change course , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but the country 's opposition parties back bush . in a national address , chancellor gerhard schröder said on tuesday morning that he steadfastly opposed president george w. bush 's just announced ultimatum to iraqi leader saddam hussein and the war that the demand could trigger .
" my question was and remains : does the size of the threat posed by the iraqi dictator justify a decision to wage a war that will surely lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent children , women and men ?
my answer to this question was and remains : no , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush schröder made his television address eight hours after u.s. president george w. bush -lrb- photo -rrb- gave saddam 48 hours to leave his country and told americans that a military confrontation would ultimately make them safer .
" the security of the world requires disarming saddam hussein now , " bush said .
division between americans and germans the issue of war against iraq has driven a wedge between the united states and germany , two allies whose relationship was tightly bound together during four decades of cold war and the reunification of west germany and east germany that followed in 1990 .
schröder began criticizing bush 's plans for a war during the summer as he campaigned for re-election .
as part of his stump speeches , schröder said german troops would not participate in such a war .
he intensified that opposition in january , when he announced that germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
during the address on tuesday , schröder reiterated one position he took during much of the debate .
" iraq is a country that is being extensively inspected by the united nations , " he said .
" the disarmament steps that the security council has demanded are being increasingly implemented .
therefore , there is no reason to break off this process of disarmament . "
schröder delivered the roughly five-minute address while sitting at a desk with his hands folded in front of him .
at his back was a large office window framed by the german and european flags to his right and a plant to his left .
outside on this hazy morning , traffic rolled along a road located not far from the home of the german parliament , the reichstag .
the chancellor concluded the address by pledging to continue to work for peace and security .
" you can be assured that my government will steadfastly use every chance , no matter how small , to achieve world peace .
you can also be assured that we will take every possible measure to ensure security in our country , " he said .
opposition parties back u.s. unlike schröder , germany 's major opposition parties endorsed the course set by bush .
" we regret that the use of military force has become more likely and that the u.n. security council was unable to reach a unified position on the question of completely and unconditionally disarming iraq , even though it unanimously determined that a threat to world peace existed , " a statement said .
the statement was passed on tuesday with only four negative votes by the combined parliamentary groups of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the pending war against saddam 's regime raises a parliamentary question for schröder .
despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .
poles , australians to provide troops in contrast , bush gained the support of other countries after the speech .
poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .
" u.s. president bush has conducted a major undertaking in his search for international support , " koizumi said .
" and in this sense , i think he has made an inevitable decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan turkey 's new prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , also took a step on tuesday toward possible support of the u.s. military .
erdogan said the country 's parliament would reconsider the matter on wednesday or thursday .
the parliament voted on march 1 against allowing the united states to station a force of 62,000 troops who could have invaded iraq across the turkish border .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2003 why germany voted ' yes ' to invade yugoslavia but ' no ' to iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato strikes in belgrade : germany 's first military deployment since world war ii chancellor gerhard schröder has ruled out german military participation in an iraq war .
but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ? chancellor schröder somberly addressed the nation on march 24 , 1999 , shortly after nato began bombing yugoslavia .
he announced that his government had made a difficult decision .
" after all , this is the first time since world war ii that german soldiers have been deployed in combat , " he said .
" we are not waging a war , but we must bring about a peaceful solution in kosovo , even if that requires the use of military force . "
schröder explained that this was the reason why the german government had decided to take part in the military campaign against slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today , the same governing coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected involvement in a war against iraq , arguing that military intervention would only serve to further destabilize the middle east .
in 1999 , the government used the opposite argument , maintaining that the balkans would be in greater danger if germany did not act .
explaining the contradiction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr on parade .
" in kosovo , we had a situation of ongoing danger , " social democratic party foreign policy spokeswoman ute zapf told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it was about ethnic expulsion and impending genocide .
now , in iraq , we have a potential threat from iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no immediate danger . "
zapf insisted the problems were very different .
germany 's opposition parties hold a different view .
christoph schmidt , defense spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , criticized the government for committing itself too early to a " no " vote on participation in order to assure shröder 's autumn reelection bid last year .
now , schmidt says , schröder has no maneuvering room to change his position .
" july 2002 was the point of departure , " schmidt explains .
" then schröder tried to take advantage of the mood against military intervention -lrb- in iraq -rrb- for the election campaign .
the price was that other foreign policy options were abandoned .
and now , getting out of that without losing face is hard . "
political perspectives günther joetze believes that neither of these explanations is sufficient .
the former president of the federal academy for security policy has written a book about germany 's role in the kosovo conflict and is working on a new book about its role in the iraq crisis .
joetze ascribes the german government 's differing attitudes toward kosovo and iraq to numerous motives .
above all , says joetze , the government holds different political perspectives for the two crisis regions .
in kosovo , the international community was aiming to enforce humanitarian and democratic standards , which can not be transmitted to iraq as easily , joetze maintains .
furthermore , saddam hussein is not considered the only rogue in the region , which is why the government does not believe that a war will improve the situation .
in the case of kosovo , joetze says , germany 's partners in nato expected that the german army , the bundeswehr , would take part in military operations .
the government had little choice but to say " yes , " joetze maintains .
plus , the government had only been in office for a short time and had to prove itself in the realm of foreign policy .
" the social democrats did n't want to start their term in government with discord in the coalition , " joetze insists .
" whereas , for foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the question was a different one .
it was made clear to him -lrb- as the junior partner in the governing coalition -rrb- that he could only remain foreign minister and a governing partner if he towed the same line . "

politicians of the german governing parties do n't approve a leadership role for german soldiers in a planned u.n. peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
the british government offered to take over the leadership , according to angelika beer , the german green parties defense policy expert , on tuesday , dec .
12 , 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- today , joetze says the government is in a different position - not just because it has been in office for four years , but also because germany is now the second-largest contributor of troops to international peacekeeping operations around the world .
" the defense minister and the chancellor say we continually prove ourselves to be reliable partners , " joetze says .
" we are prepared to make our contribution .
we can afford to have another opinion on one particular question . "
" -lrb- in 1999 -rrb- the only international operation the bundeswehr was involved in was the air campaign against yugoslavia .
there were n't any german troops in macedonia or afghanistan yet .
the issue was the first nato troop deployment . "
besides , the mood among the population has changed in the past four years .
then , most germans were in favor of a war against the milosevic regime .
today , the majority rejects a war against saddam hussein .
in that light , joetze defends schröder 's firm position against an iraq war .
nor does he find the anti-war stance " reprehensible , " as some members of germany 's opposition government have .
on the contrary , he says , a major pillar of democratically elected representatives is the idea of listening to the voice of the people and acting on those wishes . claus häcking send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to take over peacekeeping in afghanistan in a significant reminder of its international duties , german peacekeepers in afghanistan will take over the isaf security force in kabul on feb .

but the country 's opposition parties back bush . in a national address , chancellor gerhard schröder said on tuesday morning that he steadfastly opposed president george w. bush 's just announced ultimatum to iraqi leader saddam hussein and the war that the demand could trigger .
" my question was and remains : does the size of the threat posed by the iraqi dictator justify a decision to wage a war that will surely lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent children , women and men ?
my answer to this question was and remains : no , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush schröder made his television address eight hours after u.s. president george w. bush -lrb- photo -rrb- gave saddam 48 hours to leave his country and told americans that a military confrontation would ultimately make them safer .
" the security of the world requires disarming saddam hussein now , " bush said .
division between americans and germans the issue of war against iraq has driven a wedge between the united states and germany , two allies whose relationship was tightly bound together during four decades of cold war and the reunification of west germany and east germany that followed in 1990 .
schröder began criticizing bush 's plans for a war during the summer as he campaigned for re-election .
as part of his stump speeches , schröder said german troops would not participate in such a war .
he intensified that opposition in january , when he announced that germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
during the address on tuesday , schröder reiterated one position he took during much of the debate .
" iraq is a country that is being extensively inspected by the united nations , " he said .
" the disarmament steps that the security council has demanded are being increasingly implemented .
therefore , there is no reason to break off this process of disarmament . "
schröder delivered the roughly five-minute address while sitting at a desk with his hands folded in front of him .
at his back was a large office window framed by the german and european flags to his right and a plant to his left .
outside on this hazy morning , traffic rolled along a road located not far from the home of the german parliament , the reichstag .
the chancellor concluded the address by pledging to continue to work for peace and security .
" you can be assured that my government will steadfastly use every chance , no matter how small , to achieve world peace .
you can also be assured that we will take every possible measure to ensure security in our country , " he said .
opposition parties back u.s. unlike schröder , germany 's major opposition parties endorsed the course set by bush .
" we regret that the use of military force has become more likely and that the u.n. security council was unable to reach a unified position on the question of completely and unconditionally disarming iraq , even though it unanimously determined that a threat to world peace existed , " a statement said .
the statement was passed on tuesday with only four negative votes by the combined parliamentary groups of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the pending war against saddam 's regime raises a parliamentary question for schröder .
despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .
poles , australians to provide troops in contrast , bush gained the support of other countries after the speech .
poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .
" u.s. president bush has conducted a major undertaking in his search for international support , " koizumi said .
" and in this sense , i think he has made an inevitable decision . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2003 why germany voted ' yes ' to invade yugoslavia but ' no ' to iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato strikes in belgrade : germany 's first military deployment since world war ii chancellor gerhard schröder has ruled out german military participation in an iraq war .
but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ? chancellor schröder somberly addressed the nation on march 24 , 1999 , shortly after nato began bombing yugoslavia .
he announced that his government had made a difficult decision .
" after all , this is the first time since world war ii that german soldiers have been deployed in combat , " he said .
" we are not waging a war , but we must bring about a peaceful solution in kosovo , even if that requires the use of military force . "
schröder explained that this was the reason why the german government had decided to take part in the military campaign against slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today , the same governing coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected involvement in a war against iraq , arguing that military intervention would only serve to further destabilize the middle east .
in 1999 , the government used the opposite argument , maintaining that the balkans would be in greater danger if germany did not act .
explaining the contradiction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr on parade .
" in kosovo , we had a situation of ongoing danger , " social democratic party foreign policy spokeswoman ute zapf told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it was about ethnic expulsion and impending genocide .
now , in iraq , we have a potential threat from iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no immediate danger . "
zapf insisted the problems were very different .
germany 's opposition parties hold a different view .
christoph schmidt , defense spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , criticized the government for committing itself too early to a " no " vote on participation in order to assure shröder 's autumn reelection bid last year .
now , schmidt says , schröder has no maneuvering room to change his position .
" july 2002 was the point of departure , " schmidt explains .
" then schröder tried to take advantage of the mood against military intervention -lrb- in iraq -rrb- for the election campaign .
the price was that other foreign policy options were abandoned .
and now , getting out of that without losing face is hard . "
political perspectives günther joetze believes that neither of these explanations is sufficient .
the former president of the federal academy for security policy has written a book about germany 's role in the kosovo conflict and is working on a new book about its role in the iraq crisis .
joetze ascribes the german government 's differing attitudes toward kosovo and iraq to numerous motives .
above all , says joetze , the government holds different political perspectives for the two crisis regions .
in kosovo , the international community was aiming to enforce humanitarian and democratic standards , which can not be transmitted to iraq as easily , joetze maintains .
furthermore , saddam hussein is not considered the only rogue in the region , which is why the government does not believe that a war will improve the situation .
in the case of kosovo , joetze says , germany 's partners in nato expected that the german army , the bundeswehr , would take part in military operations .
the government had little choice but to say " yes , " joetze maintains .
plus , the government had only been in office for a short time and had to prove itself in the realm of foreign policy .
" the social democrats did n't want to start their term in government with discord in the coalition , " joetze insists .
" whereas , for foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the question was a different one .
it was made clear to him -lrb- as the junior partner in the governing coalition -rrb- that he could only remain foreign minister and a governing partner if he towed the same line . "
international peacekeeping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in belet huen , somalia , on a united nations peacekeeping mission , are seen on this 1993 file photo .
politicians of the german governing parties do n't approve a leadership role for german soldiers in a planned u.n. peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
the british government offered to take over the leadership , according to angelika beer , the german green parties defense policy expert , on tuesday , dec .
12 , 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- today , joetze says the government is in a different position - not just because it has been in office for four years , but also because germany is now the second-largest contributor of troops to international peacekeeping operations around the world .
" the defense minister and the chancellor say we continually prove ourselves to be reliable partners , " joetze says .
" we are prepared to make our contribution .
we can afford to have another opinion on one particular question . "
" -lrb- in 1999 -rrb- the only international operation the bundeswehr was involved in was the air campaign against yugoslavia .
there were n't any german troops in macedonia or afghanistan yet .
the issue was the first nato troop deployment . "
besides , the mood among the population has changed in the past four years .
then , most germans were in favor of a war against the milosevic regime .
today , the majority rejects a war against saddam hussein .
in that light , joetze defends schröder 's firm position against an iraq war .
nor does he find the anti-war stance " reprehensible , " as some members of germany 's opposition government have .
on the contrary , he says , a major pillar of democratically elected representatives is the idea of listening to the voice of the people and acting on those wishes . claus häcking send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to take over peacekeeping in afghanistan in a significant reminder of its international duties , german peacekeepers in afghanistan will take over the isaf security force in kabul on feb .

but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ? chancellor schröder somberly addressed the nation on march 24 , 1999 , shortly after nato began bombing yugoslavia .
he announced that his government had made a difficult decision .
" after all , this is the first time since world war ii that german soldiers have been deployed in combat , " he said .
" we are not waging a war , but we must bring about a peaceful solution in kosovo , even if that requires the use of military force . "
schröder explained that this was the reason why the german government had decided to take part in the military campaign against slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today , the same governing coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected involvement in a war against iraq , arguing that military intervention would only serve to further destabilize the middle east .
in 1999 , the government used the opposite argument , maintaining that the balkans would be in greater danger if germany did not act .
explaining the contradiction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr on parade .
" in kosovo , we had a situation of ongoing danger , " social democratic party foreign policy spokeswoman ute zapf told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it was about ethnic expulsion and impending genocide .
now , in iraq , we have a potential threat from iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no immediate danger . "
zapf insisted the problems were very different .
germany 's opposition parties hold a different view .
christoph schmidt , defense spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , criticized the government for committing itself too early to a " no " vote on participation in order to assure shröder 's autumn reelection bid last year .
now , schmidt says , schröder has no maneuvering room to change his position .
" july 2002 was the point of departure , " schmidt explains .
" then schröder tried to take advantage of the mood against military intervention -lrb- in iraq -rrb- for the election campaign .
the price was that other foreign policy options were abandoned .
and now , getting out of that without losing face is hard . "
political perspectives günther joetze believes that neither of these explanations is sufficient .
the former president of the federal academy for security policy has written a book about germany 's role in the kosovo conflict and is working on a new book about its role in the iraq crisis .
joetze ascribes the german government 's differing attitudes toward kosovo and iraq to numerous motives .
above all , says joetze , the government holds different political perspectives for the two crisis regions .
in kosovo , the international community was aiming to enforce humanitarian and democratic standards , which can not be transmitted to iraq as easily , joetze maintains .
furthermore , saddam hussein is not considered the only rogue in the region , which is why the government does not believe that a war will improve the situation .
in the case of kosovo , joetze says , germany 's partners in nato expected that the german army , the bundeswehr , would take part in military operations .
the government had little choice but to say " yes , " joetze maintains .
plus , the government had only been in office for a short time and had to prove itself in the realm of foreign policy .
" the social democrats did n't want to start their term in government with discord in the coalition , " joetze insists .
" whereas , for foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the question was a different one .
it was made clear to him -lrb- as the junior partner in the governing coalition -rrb- that he could only remain foreign minister and a governing partner if he towed the same line . "

the british government offered to take over the leadership , according to angelika beer , the german green parties defense policy expert , on tuesday , dec .
12 , 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- today , joetze says the government is in a different position - not just because it has been in office for four years , but also because germany is now the second-largest contributor of troops to international peacekeeping operations around the world .
" the defense minister and the chancellor say we continually prove ourselves to be reliable partners , " joetze says .
" we are prepared to make our contribution .
we can afford to have another opinion on one particular question . "
" -lrb- in 1999 -rrb- the only international operation the bundeswehr was involved in was the air campaign against yugoslavia .
there were n't any german troops in macedonia or afghanistan yet .
the issue was the first nato troop deployment . "
besides , the mood among the population has changed in the past four years .
then , most germans were in favor of a war against the milosevic regime .
today , the majority rejects a war against saddam hussein .
in that light , joetze defends schröder 's firm position against an iraq war .
nor does he find the anti-war stance " reprehensible , " as some members of germany 's opposition government have .

british prime minister tony blair won his vote in parliament late tuesday .
but he had to put down a revolt within his own labour ranks to do so . prime minister tony blair received his much-needed parliamentary support late tuesday for british participation in a war against iraq , but he had to pay a political price in his own labour party for the victory .
with the support from the opposition , the house of commons strongly endorsed the government 's decision to use " all means necessary " to strip saddam hussein of his weapons of mass destruction .
the decision allows blair to commit the 40,000 british troops in the persian gulf in a war that could begin anytime after the deadline of 2 a.m.
central european time on thursday set by u.s. president george w. bush .
before blair could celebrate his victory , he had to put down a revolt in his own party and defeat an amendment that declared that the case for war " has not yet been established . "
on the surface , the numbers showed that blair was able to handily put down the amendment , 396 to 217 .
but 138 members of his party were among the 217 lawmakers who voted for the measure .
it was the biggest show of dissent blair has faced since coming to power in 1997 and followed a vote last month in which 122 labour lawmakers rebelled against blair 's hawkish stance .
after the first vote on tuesday , the house of commons voted 412 to 149 to approve the government 's resolve to disarm iraq .
the opposition conservatives also backed blair .
unity sought after vote following the votes , labour rebels said it was now time to unite behind blair and support british troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robin cook " i hope that the war will be over quickly , " said robin cook , a senior cabinet member who quit monday over the crisis .
" i hope it will be successful , and i hope all our troops , both the american and british , will be coming back . "
blair staked his career on the need to support military action .
" back away from this confrontation now and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects , " he said in an impassioned speech to lawmakers , as some 200 anti-war protesters demonstrated outside parliament .
blair said far more was at stake than disarming saddam - that the fundamental framework of international relations was being re-examined .
" it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century , " he said .
" it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation . "
he made the impassioned plea to parliament in an effort to shore up his slipping support within his party .
as a result of these protests , two senior cabinet ministers have quit the british government , and a midlevel cabinet minister has resigned as well .
amid the gloom , blair was able to win one small victory .
clare short , britain 's international development secretary , changed her mind about possibly resigning if the prime minister went to war without u.n. backing .
tuesday 's debate was called after the united states , britain and spain withdrew their second resolution in the u.n. security council on sunday and bush gave saddam 48 hours to leave iraq on monday evening .
three u.k. cabinet ministers resign the resignations began on monday with cook -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the house of commons .
junior health minister lord philip hunt and john denham , a mid-ranking british interior minister , followed on tuesday .
in his resignation letter , former foreign secretary cook wrote : " in principle , i believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support . "
he said he believed british " interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . "
cook received a standing ovation for the resignation speech he gave to a packed house of commons .
the next morning , hunt said in an interview on bbc radio 4 that he had " decided to resign from the government today because i don ’ t support the pre-emptive action which is going to be taken without broad international support or indeed the support of the british people . "
a handful of lower-level labour party officials also tendered their resignations on tuesday .
motion questions iraqi compliance the british parliamentarians were considering a motion that stated that iraq had not complied fully with weapons inspectors and is in material breach of u.n. resolution 1441 , the latest resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
therefore , the motion continued , the british government should " use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction . "
on monday , the british government 's top lawyer , attorney general lord goldsmith , said war without a second u.n. resolution would not break international law .
previous u.n. resolutions were sufficient to authorize the use of force against iraq , he said .
a new poll showed that public support for a war against iraq had risen slightly .
disapproval for war fell 8 percentage points to 44 percent , and support rose 9 percentage points to 38 percent .
the icm poll , published in the guardian newspaper on tuesday , said the iraq crisis had not affected labour ’ s poll rating and suggested that the blair " might have gone through the worst and his determination to secure a second u.n. resolution , though unsuccessful , has impressed voters .

british prime minister tony blair won his vote in parliament late tuesday .
but he had to put down a revolt within his own labour ranks to do so . prime minister tony blair received his much-needed parliamentary support late tuesday for british participation in a war against iraq , but he had to pay a political price in his own labour party for the victory .
with the support from the opposition , the house of commons strongly endorsed the government 's decision to use " all means necessary " to strip saddam hussein of his weapons of mass destruction .
the decision allows blair to commit the 40,000 british troops in the persian gulf in a war that could begin anytime after the deadline of 2 a.m.
central european time on thursday set by u.s. president george w. bush .
before blair could celebrate his victory , he had to put down a revolt in his own party and defeat an amendment that declared that the case for war " has not yet been established . "
on the surface , the numbers showed that blair was able to handily put down the amendment , 396 to 217 .
but 138 members of his party were among the 217 lawmakers who voted for the measure .
it was the biggest show of dissent blair has faced since coming to power in 1997 and followed a vote last month in which 122 labour lawmakers rebelled against blair 's hawkish stance .
after the first vote on tuesday , the house of commons voted 412 to 149 to approve the government 's resolve to disarm iraq .
the opposition conservatives also backed blair .
unity sought after vote following the votes , labour rebels said it was now time to unite behind blair and support british troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robin cook " i hope that the war will be over quickly , " said robin cook , a senior cabinet member who quit monday over the crisis .
" i hope it will be successful , and i hope all our troops , both the american and british , will be coming back . "
blair staked his career on the need to support military action .
" back away from this confrontation now and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects , " he said in an impassioned speech to lawmakers , as some 200 anti-war protesters demonstrated outside parliament .
blair said far more was at stake than disarming saddam - that the fundamental framework of international relations was being re-examined .
" it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century , " he said .
" it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation . "
he made the impassioned plea to parliament in an effort to shore up his slipping support within his party .
as a result of these protests , two senior cabinet ministers have quit the british government , and a midlevel cabinet minister has resigned as well .
amid the gloom , blair was able to win one small victory .
clare short , britain 's international development secretary , changed her mind about possibly resigning if the prime minister went to war without u.n. backing .
tuesday 's debate was called after the united states , britain and spain withdrew their second resolution in the u.n. security council on sunday and bush gave saddam 48 hours to leave iraq on monday evening .
three u.k. cabinet ministers resign the resignations began on monday with cook -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the house of commons .
junior health minister lord philip hunt and john denham , a mid-ranking british interior minister , followed on tuesday .
in his resignation letter , former foreign secretary cook wrote : " in principle , i believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support . "
he said he believed british " interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . "
cook received a standing ovation for the resignation speech he gave to a packed house of commons .
the next morning , hunt said in an interview on bbc radio 4 that he had " decided to resign from the government today because i don ’ t support the pre-emptive action which is going to be taken without broad international support or indeed the support of the british people . "
a handful of lower-level labour party officials also tendered their resignations on tuesday .
motion questions iraqi compliance the british parliamentarians were considering a motion that stated that iraq had not complied fully with weapons inspectors and is in material breach of u.n. resolution 1441 , the latest resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
therefore , the motion continued , the british government should " use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction . "
on monday , the british government 's top lawyer , attorney general lord goldsmith , said war without a second u.n. resolution would not break international law .
previous u.n. resolutions were sufficient to authorize the use of force against iraq , he said .
a new poll showed that public support for a war against iraq had risen slightly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.03.2003 new serbian leader pledges further reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serb prime minister zivkovic -lrb- left -rrb- with a photo of slain pm djindjic .
zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .

zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2003 russia , germany , france criticize united states on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in session : the u.n. security council unanimously approved a new iraq resolution last november .
as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .
fischer sees ' no alternative ' to u.n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the security council .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states .
bush aide sees ' many unknowns ' " on the brink of war with iraq , americans should be prepared for what we hope will be as precise , short a conflict as possible , but there are many unknowns and it could be a matter of some duration , " white house press secretary ari fleischer said .
" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .
in ankara , turkey , the new government there also made plans to help the united states conduct the war .
it scheduled a parliamentary vote for thursday on the issue of allowing the united states to use turkish airspace during the attack .
such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .
that request was rejected by the parliament on march 1 , and the decision cost the country at least $ 6 billion in aid .
germans bolster security for americans in germany , the government of gerhard schröder stepped up its security force guarding u.s. facilities in the country from 2,500 soldiers to 3,700 , defense secretary peter struck said on tuesday evening .
but struck rejected a request from the state of baden-württemberg that troops should also be assigned to protect american shopping and housing areas in the country .
the minister said such patrols were the job of police officers .
interior minister otto schily suggested that the war would increase the threat of terrorism in germany .
" the terror network al qaida will mostly react to the war by increasing its terror activities and use it for propaganda purposes , " schily said in a television interview .
" we also have to expect that there will be so-called spontaneous terrorists from the extremist , fundamentalist islamic scene . "
but rolf tophoven , a terrorism reseacher in bonn , said he thought the chances of germany 's becoming a terror target would be small .
" the danger comes from attacks carried out by unknown fanatical individual terrorists , " tophoven said .

as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .
fischer sees ' no alternative ' to u.n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the security council .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states .
bush aide sees ' many unknowns ' " on the brink of war with iraq , americans should be prepared for what we hope will be as precise , short a conflict as possible , but there are many unknowns and it could be a matter of some duration , " white house press secretary ari fleischer said .
" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .
in ankara , turkey , the new government there also made plans to help the united states conduct the war .
it scheduled a parliamentary vote for thursday on the issue of allowing the united states to use turkish airspace during the attack .
such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .
that request was rejected by the parliament on march 1 , and the decision cost the country at least $ 6 billion in aid .
germans bolster security for americans in germany , the government of gerhard schröder stepped up its security force guarding u.s. facilities in the country from 2,500 soldiers to 3,700 , defense secretary peter struck said on tuesday evening .
but struck rejected a request from the state of baden-württemberg that troops should also be assigned to protect american shopping and housing areas in the country .
the minister said such patrols were the job of police officers .
interior minister otto schily suggested that the war would increase the threat of terrorism in germany .
" the terror network al qaida will mostly react to the war by increasing its terror activities and use it for propaganda purposes , " schily said in a television interview .
" we also have to expect that there will be so-called spontaneous terrorists from the extremist , fundamentalist islamic scene . "
but rolf tophoven , a terrorism reseacher in bonn , said he thought the chances of germany 's becoming a terror target would be small .
" the danger comes from attacks carried out by unknown fanatical individual terrorists , " tophoven said .

but the country 's opposition parties back bush . in a national address , chancellor gerhard schröder said on tuesday morning that he steadfastly opposed president george w. bush 's just announced ultimatum to iraqi leader saddam hussein and the war that the demand could trigger .
" my question was and remains : does the size of the threat posed by the iraqi dictator justify a decision to wage a war that will surely lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent children , women and men ?
my answer to this question was and remains : no , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush schröder made his television address eight hours after u.s. president george w. bush -lrb- photo -rrb- gave saddam 48 hours to leave his country and told americans that a military confrontation would ultimately make them safer .
" the security of the world requires disarming saddam hussein now , " bush said .
division between americans and germans the issue of war against iraq has driven a wedge between the united states and germany , two allies whose relationship was tightly bound together during four decades of cold war and the reunification of west germany and east germany that followed in 1990 .
schröder began criticizing bush 's plans for a war during the summer as he campaigned for re-election .
as part of his stump speeches , schröder said german troops would not participate in such a war .
he intensified that opposition in january , when he announced that germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
during the address on tuesday , schröder reiterated one position he took during much of the debate .
" iraq is a country that is being extensively inspected by the united nations , " he said .
" the disarmament steps that the security council has demanded are being increasingly implemented .
therefore , there is no reason to break off this process of disarmament . "
schröder delivered the roughly five-minute address while sitting at a desk with his hands folded in front of him .
at his back was a large office window framed by the german and european flags to his right and a plant to his left .
outside on this hazy morning , traffic rolled along a road located not far from the home of the german parliament , the reichstag .
the chancellor concluded the address by pledging to continue to work for peace and security .
" you can be assured that my government will steadfastly use every chance , no matter how small , to achieve world peace .
you can also be assured that we will take every possible measure to ensure security in our country , " he said .
opposition parties back u.s. unlike schröder , germany 's major opposition parties endorsed the course set by bush .
" we regret that the use of military force has become more likely and that the u.n. security council was unable to reach a unified position on the question of completely and unconditionally disarming iraq , even though it unanimously determined that a threat to world peace existed , " a statement said .
the statement was passed on tuesday with only four negative votes by the combined parliamentary groups of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the pending war against saddam 's regime raises a parliamentary question for schröder .
despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .
poles , australians to provide troops in contrast , bush gained the support of other countries after the speech .
poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2003 why germany voted ' yes ' to invade yugoslavia but ' no ' to iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato strikes in belgrade : germany 's first military deployment since world war ii chancellor gerhard schröder has ruled out german military participation in an iraq war .
but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ? chancellor schröder somberly addressed the nation on march 24 , 1999 , shortly after nato began bombing yugoslavia .
he announced that his government had made a difficult decision .
" after all , this is the first time since world war ii that german soldiers have been deployed in combat , " he said .
" we are not waging a war , but we must bring about a peaceful solution in kosovo , even if that requires the use of military force . "
schröder explained that this was the reason why the german government had decided to take part in the military campaign against slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today , the same governing coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected involvement in a war against iraq , arguing that military intervention would only serve to further destabilize the middle east .
in 1999 , the government used the opposite argument , maintaining that the balkans would be in greater danger if germany did not act .
explaining the contradiction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr on parade .
" in kosovo , we had a situation of ongoing danger , " social democratic party foreign policy spokeswoman ute zapf told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it was about ethnic expulsion and impending genocide .
now , in iraq , we have a potential threat from iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no immediate danger . "
zapf insisted the problems were very different .
germany 's opposition parties hold a different view .
christoph schmidt , defense spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , criticized the government for committing itself too early to a " no " vote on participation in order to assure shröder 's autumn reelection bid last year .
now , schmidt says , schröder has no maneuvering room to change his position .
" july 2002 was the point of departure , " schmidt explains .
" then schröder tried to take advantage of the mood against military intervention -lrb- in iraq -rrb- for the election campaign .
the price was that other foreign policy options were abandoned .
and now , getting out of that without losing face is hard . "
political perspectives günther joetze believes that neither of these explanations is sufficient .
the former president of the federal academy for security policy has written a book about germany 's role in the kosovo conflict and is working on a new book about its role in the iraq crisis .
joetze ascribes the german government 's differing attitudes toward kosovo and iraq to numerous motives .
above all , says joetze , the government holds different political perspectives for the two crisis regions .
in kosovo , the international community was aiming to enforce humanitarian and democratic standards , which can not be transmitted to iraq as easily , joetze maintains .
furthermore , saddam hussein is not considered the only rogue in the region , which is why the government does not believe that a war will improve the situation .
in the case of kosovo , joetze says , germany 's partners in nato expected that the german army , the bundeswehr , would take part in military operations .
the government had little choice but to say " yes , " joetze maintains .
plus , the government had only been in office for a short time and had to prove itself in the realm of foreign policy .
" the social democrats did n't want to start their term in government with discord in the coalition , " joetze insists .
" whereas , for foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the question was a different one .
it was made clear to him -lrb- as the junior partner in the governing coalition -rrb- that he could only remain foreign minister and a governing partner if he towed the same line . "
international peacekeeping bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in belet huen , somalia , on a united nations peacekeeping mission , are seen on this 1993 file photo .
politicians of the german governing parties do n't approve a leadership role for german soldiers in a planned u.n. peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
the british government offered to take over the leadership , according to angelika beer , the german green parties defense policy expert , on tuesday , dec .
12 , 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- today , joetze says the government is in a different position - not just because it has been in office for four years , but also because germany is now the second-largest contributor of troops to international peacekeeping operations around the world .
" the defense minister and the chancellor say we continually prove ourselves to be reliable partners , " joetze says .
" we are prepared to make our contribution .
we can afford to have another opinion on one particular question . "
" -lrb- in 1999 -rrb- the only international operation the bundeswehr was involved in was the air campaign against yugoslavia .
there were n't any german troops in macedonia or afghanistan yet .
the issue was the first nato troop deployment . "
besides , the mood among the population has changed in the past four years .
then , most germans were in favor of a war against the milosevic regime .
today , the majority rejects a war against saddam hussein .
in that light , joetze defends schröder 's firm position against an iraq war .
nor does he find the anti-war stance " reprehensible , " as some members of germany 's opposition government have .
on the contrary , he says , a major pillar of democratically elected representatives is the idea of listening to the voice of the people and acting on those wishes . claus häcking send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to take over peacekeeping in afghanistan in a significant reminder of its international duties , german peacekeepers in afghanistan will take over the isaf security force in kabul on feb .

but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ? chancellor schröder somberly addressed the nation on march 24 , 1999 , shortly after nato began bombing yugoslavia .
he announced that his government had made a difficult decision .
" after all , this is the first time since world war ii that german soldiers have been deployed in combat , " he said .
" we are not waging a war , but we must bring about a peaceful solution in kosovo , even if that requires the use of military force . "
schröder explained that this was the reason why the german government had decided to take part in the military campaign against slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today , the same governing coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected involvement in a war against iraq , arguing that military intervention would only serve to further destabilize the middle east .
in 1999 , the government used the opposite argument , maintaining that the balkans would be in greater danger if germany did not act .
explaining the contradiction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr on parade .
" in kosovo , we had a situation of ongoing danger , " social democratic party foreign policy spokeswoman ute zapf told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it was about ethnic expulsion and impending genocide .
now , in iraq , we have a potential threat from iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no immediate danger . "
zapf insisted the problems were very different .
germany 's opposition parties hold a different view .
christoph schmidt , defense spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , criticized the government for committing itself too early to a " no " vote on participation in order to assure shröder 's autumn reelection bid last year .
now , schmidt says , schröder has no maneuvering room to change his position .
" july 2002 was the point of departure , " schmidt explains .
" then schröder tried to take advantage of the mood against military intervention -lrb- in iraq -rrb- for the election campaign .
the price was that other foreign policy options were abandoned .
and now , getting out of that without losing face is hard . "
political perspectives günther joetze believes that neither of these explanations is sufficient .
the former president of the federal academy for security policy has written a book about germany 's role in the kosovo conflict and is working on a new book about its role in the iraq crisis .
joetze ascribes the german government 's differing attitudes toward kosovo and iraq to numerous motives .
above all , says joetze , the government holds different political perspectives for the two crisis regions .
in kosovo , the international community was aiming to enforce humanitarian and democratic standards , which can not be transmitted to iraq as easily , joetze maintains .
furthermore , saddam hussein is not considered the only rogue in the region , which is why the government does not believe that a war will improve the situation .
in the case of kosovo , joetze says , germany 's partners in nato expected that the german army , the bundeswehr , would take part in military operations .
the government had little choice but to say " yes , " joetze maintains .
plus , the government had only been in office for a short time and had to prove itself in the realm of foreign policy .
" the social democrats did n't want to start their term in government with discord in the coalition , " joetze insists .
" whereas , for foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the question was a different one .
it was made clear to him -lrb- as the junior partner in the governing coalition -rrb- that he could only remain foreign minister and a governing partner if he towed the same line . "

12 , 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- today , joetze says the government is in a different position - not just because it has been in office for four years , but also because germany is now the second-largest contributor of troops to international peacekeeping operations around the world .
" the defense minister and the chancellor say we continually prove ourselves to be reliable partners , " joetze says .
" we are prepared to make our contribution .
we can afford to have another opinion on one particular question . "
" -lrb- in 1999 -rrb- the only international operation the bundeswehr was involved in was the air campaign against yugoslavia .
there were n't any german troops in macedonia or afghanistan yet .
the issue was the first nato troop deployment . "
besides , the mood among the population has changed in the past four years .
then , most germans were in favor of a war against the milosevic regime .
today , the majority rejects a war against saddam hussein .
in that light , joetze defends schröder 's firm position against an iraq war .

12 , 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- today , joetze says the government is in a different position - not just because it has been in office for four years , but also because germany is now the second-largest contributor of troops to international peacekeeping operations around the world .
" the defense minister and the chancellor say we continually prove ourselves to be reliable partners , " joetze says .
" we are prepared to make our contribution .
we can afford to have another opinion on one particular question . "
" -lrb- in 1999 -rrb- the only international operation the bundeswehr was involved in was the air campaign against yugoslavia .
there were n't any german troops in macedonia or afghanistan yet .
the issue was the first nato troop deployment . "
besides , the mood among the population has changed in the past four years .
then , most germans were in favor of a war against the milosevic regime .
today , the majority rejects a war against saddam hussein .
in that light , joetze defends schröder 's firm position against an iraq war .
nor does he find the anti-war stance " reprehensible , " as some members of germany 's opposition government have .
on the contrary , he says , a major pillar of democratically elected representatives is the idea of listening to the voice of the people and acting on those wishes . claus häcking send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to take over peacekeeping in afghanistan in a significant reminder of its international duties , german peacekeepers in afghanistan will take over the isaf security force in kabul on feb .

british prime minister tony blair won his vote in parliament late tuesday .
but he had to put down a revolt within his own labour ranks to do so . prime minister tony blair received his much-needed parliamentary support late tuesday for british participation in a war against iraq , but he had to pay a political price in his own labour party for the victory .
with the support from the opposition , the house of commons strongly endorsed the government 's decision to use " all means necessary " to strip saddam hussein of his weapons of mass destruction .
the decision allows blair to commit the 40,000 british troops in the persian gulf in a war that could begin anytime after the deadline of 2 a.m.
central european time on thursday set by u.s. president george w. bush .
before blair could celebrate his victory , he had to put down a revolt in his own party and defeat an amendment that declared that the case for war " has not yet been established . "
on the surface , the numbers showed that blair was able to handily put down the amendment , 396 to 217 .
but 138 members of his party were among the 217 lawmakers who voted for the measure .
it was the biggest show of dissent blair has faced since coming to power in 1997 and followed a vote last month in which 122 labour lawmakers rebelled against blair 's hawkish stance .
after the first vote on tuesday , the house of commons voted 412 to 149 to approve the government 's resolve to disarm iraq .
the opposition conservatives also backed blair .
unity sought after vote following the votes , labour rebels said it was now time to unite behind blair and support british troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robin cook " i hope that the war will be over quickly , " said robin cook , a senior cabinet member who quit monday over the crisis .
" i hope it will be successful , and i hope all our troops , both the american and british , will be coming back . "
blair staked his career on the need to support military action .
" back away from this confrontation now and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects , " he said in an impassioned speech to lawmakers , as some 200 anti-war protesters demonstrated outside parliament .
blair said far more was at stake than disarming saddam - that the fundamental framework of international relations was being re-examined .
" it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century , " he said .
" it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation . "
he made the impassioned plea to parliament in an effort to shore up his slipping support within his party .
as a result of these protests , two senior cabinet ministers have quit the british government , and a midlevel cabinet minister has resigned as well .
amid the gloom , blair was able to win one small victory .
clare short , britain 's international development secretary , changed her mind about possibly resigning if the prime minister went to war without u.n. backing .
tuesday 's debate was called after the united states , britain and spain withdrew their second resolution in the u.n. security council on sunday and bush gave saddam 48 hours to leave iraq on monday evening .
three u.k. cabinet ministers resign the resignations began on monday with cook -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the house of commons .
junior health minister lord philip hunt and john denham , a mid-ranking british interior minister , followed on tuesday .
in his resignation letter , former foreign secretary cook wrote : " in principle , i believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support . "
he said he believed british " interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . "
cook received a standing ovation for the resignation speech he gave to a packed house of commons .
the next morning , hunt said in an interview on bbc radio 4 that he had " decided to resign from the government today because i don ’ t support the pre-emptive action which is going to be taken without broad international support or indeed the support of the british people . "
a handful of lower-level labour party officials also tendered their resignations on tuesday .
motion questions iraqi compliance the british parliamentarians were considering a motion that stated that iraq had not complied fully with weapons inspectors and is in material breach of u.n. resolution 1441 , the latest resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
therefore , the motion continued , the british government should " use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction . "
on monday , the british government 's top lawyer , attorney general lord goldsmith , said war without a second u.n. resolution would not break international law .
previous u.n. resolutions were sufficient to authorize the use of force against iraq , he said .
a new poll showed that public support for a war against iraq had risen slightly .
disapproval for war fell 8 percentage points to 44 percent , and support rose 9 percentage points to 38 percent .
the icm poll , published in the guardian newspaper on tuesday , said the iraq crisis had not affected labour ’ s poll rating and suggested that the blair " might have gone through the worst and his determination to secure a second u.n. resolution , though unsuccessful , has impressed voters .

british prime minister tony blair won his vote in parliament late tuesday .
but he had to put down a revolt within his own labour ranks to do so . prime minister tony blair received his much-needed parliamentary support late tuesday for british participation in a war against iraq , but he had to pay a political price in his own labour party for the victory .
with the support from the opposition , the house of commons strongly endorsed the government 's decision to use " all means necessary " to strip saddam hussein of his weapons of mass destruction .
the decision allows blair to commit the 40,000 british troops in the persian gulf in a war that could begin anytime after the deadline of 2 a.m.
central european time on thursday set by u.s. president george w. bush .
before blair could celebrate his victory , he had to put down a revolt in his own party and defeat an amendment that declared that the case for war " has not yet been established . "
on the surface , the numbers showed that blair was able to handily put down the amendment , 396 to 217 .
but 138 members of his party were among the 217 lawmakers who voted for the measure .
it was the biggest show of dissent blair has faced since coming to power in 1997 and followed a vote last month in which 122 labour lawmakers rebelled against blair 's hawkish stance .
after the first vote on tuesday , the house of commons voted 412 to 149 to approve the government 's resolve to disarm iraq .
the opposition conservatives also backed blair .
unity sought after vote following the votes , labour rebels said it was now time to unite behind blair and support british troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robin cook " i hope that the war will be over quickly , " said robin cook , a senior cabinet member who quit monday over the crisis .
" i hope it will be successful , and i hope all our troops , both the american and british , will be coming back . "
blair staked his career on the need to support military action .
" back away from this confrontation now and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects , " he said in an impassioned speech to lawmakers , as some 200 anti-war protesters demonstrated outside parliament .
blair said far more was at stake than disarming saddam - that the fundamental framework of international relations was being re-examined .
" it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century , " he said .
" it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation . "
he made the impassioned plea to parliament in an effort to shore up his slipping support within his party .
as a result of these protests , two senior cabinet ministers have quit the british government , and a midlevel cabinet minister has resigned as well .
amid the gloom , blair was able to win one small victory .
clare short , britain 's international development secretary , changed her mind about possibly resigning if the prime minister went to war without u.n. backing .
tuesday 's debate was called after the united states , britain and spain withdrew their second resolution in the u.n. security council on sunday and bush gave saddam 48 hours to leave iraq on monday evening .
three u.k. cabinet ministers resign the resignations began on monday with cook -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the house of commons .
junior health minister lord philip hunt and john denham , a mid-ranking british interior minister , followed on tuesday .
in his resignation letter , former foreign secretary cook wrote : " in principle , i believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support . "
he said he believed british " interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . "
cook received a standing ovation for the resignation speech he gave to a packed house of commons .

zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday .

zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday .

as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .
fischer sees ' no alternative ' to u.n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the security council .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states .
bush aide sees ' many unknowns ' " on the brink of war with iraq , americans should be prepared for what we hope will be as precise , short a conflict as possible , but there are many unknowns and it could be a matter of some duration , " white house press secretary ari fleischer said .
" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .
in ankara , turkey , the new government there also made plans to help the united states conduct the war .
it scheduled a parliamentary vote for thursday on the issue of allowing the united states to use turkish airspace during the attack .
such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .
that request was rejected by the parliament on march 1 , and the decision cost the country at least $ 6 billion in aid .
germans bolster security for americans in germany , the government of gerhard schröder stepped up its security force guarding u.s. facilities in the country from 2,500 soldiers to 3,700 , defense secretary peter struck said on tuesday evening .
but struck rejected a request from the state of baden-württemberg that troops should also be assigned to protect american shopping and housing areas in the country .
the minister said such patrols were the job of police officers .
interior minister otto schily suggested that the war would increase the threat of terrorism in germany .
" the terror network al qaida will mostly react to the war by increasing its terror activities and use it for propaganda purposes , " schily said in a television interview .
" we also have to expect that there will be so-called spontaneous terrorists from the extremist , fundamentalist islamic scene . "
but rolf tophoven , a terrorism reseacher in bonn , said he thought the chances of germany 's becoming a terror target would be small .
" the danger comes from attacks carried out by unknown fanatical individual terrorists , " tophoven said .

ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .
fischer sees ' no alternative ' to u.n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the security council .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states .
bush aide sees ' many unknowns ' " on the brink of war with iraq , americans should be prepared for what we hope will be as precise , short a conflict as possible , but there are many unknowns and it could be a matter of some duration , " white house press secretary ari fleischer said .
" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .
in ankara , turkey , the new government there also made plans to help the united states conduct the war .
it scheduled a parliamentary vote for thursday on the issue of allowing the united states to use turkish airspace during the attack .
such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .
that request was rejected by the parliament on march 1 , and the decision cost the country at least $ 6 billion in aid .
germans bolster security for americans in germany , the government of gerhard schröder stepped up its security force guarding u.s. facilities in the country from 2,500 soldiers to 3,700 , defense secretary peter struck said on tuesday evening .
but struck rejected a request from the state of baden-württemberg that troops should also be assigned to protect american shopping and housing areas in the country .
the minister said such patrols were the job of police officers .
interior minister otto schily suggested that the war would increase the threat of terrorism in germany .
" the terror network al qaida will mostly react to the war by increasing its terror activities and use it for propaganda purposes , " schily said in a television interview .
" we also have to expect that there will be so-called spontaneous terrorists from the extremist , fundamentalist islamic scene . "
but rolf tophoven , a terrorism reseacher in bonn , said he thought the chances of germany 's becoming a terror target would be small .
" the danger comes from attacks carried out by unknown fanatical individual terrorists , " tophoven said .
" we are n't the main address for terrorists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2003 schröder rejects war that will kill ' thousands ' in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : addressing the nation : chancellor gerhard schröder germany 's chancellor says in a reaction to the united states ' ultimatum that the united nations should be able to continue its inspection program .
but the country 's opposition parties back bush . in a national address , chancellor gerhard schröder said on tuesday morning that he steadfastly opposed president george w. bush 's just announced ultimatum to iraqi leader saddam hussein and the war that the demand could trigger .
" my question was and remains : does the size of the threat posed by the iraqi dictator justify a decision to wage a war that will surely lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent children , women and men ?
my answer to this question was and remains : no , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush schröder made his television address eight hours after u.s. president george w. bush -lrb- photo -rrb- gave saddam 48 hours to leave his country and told americans that a military confrontation would ultimately make them safer .
" the security of the world requires disarming saddam hussein now , " bush said .
division between americans and germans the issue of war against iraq has driven a wedge between the united states and germany , two allies whose relationship was tightly bound together during four decades of cold war and the reunification of west germany and east germany that followed in 1990 .
schröder began criticizing bush 's plans for a war during the summer as he campaigned for re-election .
as part of his stump speeches , schröder said german troops would not participate in such a war .
he intensified that opposition in january , when he announced that germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
during the address on tuesday , schröder reiterated one position he took during much of the debate .
" iraq is a country that is being extensively inspected by the united nations , " he said .
" the disarmament steps that the security council has demanded are being increasingly implemented .
therefore , there is no reason to break off this process of disarmament . "
schröder delivered the roughly five-minute address while sitting at a desk with his hands folded in front of him .
at his back was a large office window framed by the german and european flags to his right and a plant to his left .
outside on this hazy morning , traffic rolled along a road located not far from the home of the german parliament , the reichstag .
the chancellor concluded the address by pledging to continue to work for peace and security .
" you can be assured that my government will steadfastly use every chance , no matter how small , to achieve world peace .
you can also be assured that we will take every possible measure to ensure security in our country , " he said .
opposition parties back u.s. unlike schröder , germany 's major opposition parties endorsed the course set by bush .
" we regret that the use of military force has become more likely and that the u.n. security council was unable to reach a unified position on the question of completely and unconditionally disarming iraq , even though it unanimously determined that a threat to world peace existed , " a statement said .
the statement was passed on tuesday with only four negative votes by the combined parliamentary groups of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the pending war against saddam 's regime raises a parliamentary question for schröder .
despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .
poles , australians to provide troops in contrast , bush gained the support of other countries after the speech .
poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .
" u.s. president bush has conducted a major undertaking in his search for international support , " koizumi said .
" and in this sense , i think he has made an inevitable decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan turkey 's new prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , also took a step on tuesday toward possible support of the u.s. military .
erdogan said the country 's parliament would reconsider the matter on wednesday or thursday .
the parliament voted on march 1 against allowing the united states to station a force of 62,000 troops who could have invaded iraq across the turkish border .
details about the new plan were not released .

but the country 's opposition parties back bush . in a national address , chancellor gerhard schröder said on tuesday morning that he steadfastly opposed president george w. bush 's just announced ultimatum to iraqi leader saddam hussein and the war that the demand could trigger .
" my question was and remains : does the size of the threat posed by the iraqi dictator justify a decision to wage a war that will surely lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent children , women and men ?
my answer to this question was and remains : no , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush schröder made his television address eight hours after u.s. president george w. bush -lrb- photo -rrb- gave saddam 48 hours to leave his country and told americans that a military confrontation would ultimately make them safer .
" the security of the world requires disarming saddam hussein now , " bush said .
division between americans and germans the issue of war against iraq has driven a wedge between the united states and germany , two allies whose relationship was tightly bound together during four decades of cold war and the reunification of west germany and east germany that followed in 1990 .
schröder began criticizing bush 's plans for a war during the summer as he campaigned for re-election .
as part of his stump speeches , schröder said german troops would not participate in such a war .
he intensified that opposition in january , when he announced that germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
during the address on tuesday , schröder reiterated one position he took during much of the debate .
" iraq is a country that is being extensively inspected by the united nations , " he said .
" the disarmament steps that the security council has demanded are being increasingly implemented .
therefore , there is no reason to break off this process of disarmament . "
schröder delivered the roughly five-minute address while sitting at a desk with his hands folded in front of him .
at his back was a large office window framed by the german and european flags to his right and a plant to his left .
outside on this hazy morning , traffic rolled along a road located not far from the home of the german parliament , the reichstag .
the chancellor concluded the address by pledging to continue to work for peace and security .
" you can be assured that my government will steadfastly use every chance , no matter how small , to achieve world peace .
you can also be assured that we will take every possible measure to ensure security in our country , " he said .
opposition parties back u.s. unlike schröder , germany 's major opposition parties endorsed the course set by bush .
" we regret that the use of military force has become more likely and that the u.n. security council was unable to reach a unified position on the question of completely and unconditionally disarming iraq , even though it unanimously determined that a threat to world peace existed , " a statement said .
the statement was passed on tuesday with only four negative votes by the combined parliamentary groups of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the pending war against saddam 's regime raises a parliamentary question for schröder .
despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .
poles , australians to provide troops in contrast , bush gained the support of other countries after the speech .
poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .
" u.s. president bush has conducted a major undertaking in his search for international support , " koizumi said .
" and in this sense , i think he has made an inevitable decision . "

but the country 's opposition parties back bush . in a national address , chancellor gerhard schröder said on tuesday morning that he steadfastly opposed president george w. bush 's just announced ultimatum to iraqi leader saddam hussein and the war that the demand could trigger .
" my question was and remains : does the size of the threat posed by the iraqi dictator justify a decision to wage a war that will surely lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent children , women and men ?
my answer to this question was and remains : no , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush schröder made his television address eight hours after u.s. president george w. bush -lrb- photo -rrb- gave saddam 48 hours to leave his country and told americans that a military confrontation would ultimately make them safer .
" the security of the world requires disarming saddam hussein now , " bush said .
division between americans and germans the issue of war against iraq has driven a wedge between the united states and germany , two allies whose relationship was tightly bound together during four decades of cold war and the reunification of west germany and east germany that followed in 1990 .
schröder began criticizing bush 's plans for a war during the summer as he campaigned for re-election .
as part of his stump speeches , schröder said german troops would not participate in such a war .
he intensified that opposition in january , when he announced that germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
during the address on tuesday , schröder reiterated one position he took during much of the debate .
" iraq is a country that is being extensively inspected by the united nations , " he said .
" the disarmament steps that the security council has demanded are being increasingly implemented .
therefore , there is no reason to break off this process of disarmament . "
schröder delivered the roughly five-minute address while sitting at a desk with his hands folded in front of him .
at his back was a large office window framed by the german and european flags to his right and a plant to his left .
outside on this hazy morning , traffic rolled along a road located not far from the home of the german parliament , the reichstag .
the chancellor concluded the address by pledging to continue to work for peace and security .
" you can be assured that my government will steadfastly use every chance , no matter how small , to achieve world peace .
you can also be assured that we will take every possible measure to ensure security in our country , " he said .
opposition parties back u.s. unlike schröder , germany 's major opposition parties endorsed the course set by bush .
" we regret that the use of military force has become more likely and that the u.n. security council was unable to reach a unified position on the question of completely and unconditionally disarming iraq , even though it unanimously determined that a threat to world peace existed , " a statement said .
the statement was passed on tuesday with only four negative votes by the combined parliamentary groups of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the pending war against saddam 's regime raises a parliamentary question for schröder .
despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .
poles , australians to provide troops in contrast , bush gained the support of other countries after the speech .
poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .
" u.s. president bush has conducted a major undertaking in his search for international support , " koizumi said .
" and in this sense , i think he has made an inevitable decision . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2003 why germany voted ' yes ' to invade yugoslavia but ' no ' to iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato strikes in belgrade : germany 's first military deployment since world war ii chancellor gerhard schröder has ruled out german military participation in an iraq war .
but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ? chancellor schröder somberly addressed the nation on march 24 , 1999 , shortly after nato began bombing yugoslavia .
he announced that his government had made a difficult decision .
" after all , this is the first time since world war ii that german soldiers have been deployed in combat , " he said .
" we are not waging a war , but we must bring about a peaceful solution in kosovo , even if that requires the use of military force . "
schröder explained that this was the reason why the german government had decided to take part in the military campaign against slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today , the same governing coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected involvement in a war against iraq , arguing that military intervention would only serve to further destabilize the middle east .
in 1999 , the government used the opposite argument , maintaining that the balkans would be in greater danger if germany did not act .
explaining the contradiction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr on parade .
" in kosovo , we had a situation of ongoing danger , " social democratic party foreign policy spokeswoman ute zapf told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it was about ethnic expulsion and impending genocide .
now , in iraq , we have a potential threat from iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no immediate danger . "
zapf insisted the problems were very different .
germany 's opposition parties hold a different view .
christoph schmidt , defense spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , criticized the government for committing itself too early to a " no " vote on participation in order to assure shröder 's autumn reelection bid last year .
now , schmidt says , schröder has no maneuvering room to change his position .
" july 2002 was the point of departure , " schmidt explains .
" then schröder tried to take advantage of the mood against military intervention -lrb- in iraq -rrb- for the election campaign .
the price was that other foreign policy options were abandoned .
and now , getting out of that without losing face is hard . "
political perspectives günther joetze believes that neither of these explanations is sufficient .
the former president of the federal academy for security policy has written a book about germany 's role in the kosovo conflict and is working on a new book about its role in the iraq crisis .
joetze ascribes the german government 's differing attitudes toward kosovo and iraq to numerous motives .
above all , says joetze , the government holds different political perspectives for the two crisis regions .
in kosovo , the international community was aiming to enforce humanitarian and democratic standards , which can not be transmitted to iraq as easily , joetze maintains .
furthermore , saddam hussein is not considered the only rogue in the region , which is why the government does not believe that a war will improve the situation .
in the case of kosovo , joetze says , germany 's partners in nato expected that the german army , the bundeswehr , would take part in military operations .
the government had little choice but to say " yes , " joetze maintains .
plus , the government had only been in office for a short time and had to prove itself in the realm of foreign policy .
" the social democrats did n't want to start their term in government with discord in the coalition , " joetze insists .
" whereas , for foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the question was a different one .
it was made clear to him -lrb- as the junior partner in the governing coalition -rrb- that he could only remain foreign minister and a governing partner if he towed the same line . "

but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ? chancellor schröder somberly addressed the nation on march 24 , 1999 , shortly after nato began bombing yugoslavia .
he announced that his government had made a difficult decision .
" after all , this is the first time since world war ii that german soldiers have been deployed in combat , " he said .
" we are not waging a war , but we must bring about a peaceful solution in kosovo , even if that requires the use of military force . "
schröder explained that this was the reason why the german government had decided to take part in the military campaign against slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today , the same governing coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected involvement in a war against iraq , arguing that military intervention would only serve to further destabilize the middle east .
in 1999 , the government used the opposite argument , maintaining that the balkans would be in greater danger if germany did not act .

" in kosovo , we had a situation of ongoing danger , " social democratic party foreign policy spokeswoman ute zapf told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it was about ethnic expulsion and impending genocide .
now , in iraq , we have a potential threat from iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no immediate danger . "
zapf insisted the problems were very different .
germany 's opposition parties hold a different view .
christoph schmidt , defense spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , criticized the government for committing itself too early to a " no " vote on participation in order to assure shröder 's autumn reelection bid last year .
now , schmidt says , schröder has no maneuvering room to change his position .
" july 2002 was the point of departure , " schmidt explains .
" then schröder tried to take advantage of the mood against military intervention -lrb- in iraq -rrb- for the election campaign .
the price was that other foreign policy options were abandoned .
and now , getting out of that without losing face is hard . "
political perspectives günther joetze believes that neither of these explanations is sufficient .
the former president of the federal academy for security policy has written a book about germany 's role in the kosovo conflict and is working on a new book about its role in the iraq crisis .
joetze ascribes the german government 's differing attitudes toward kosovo and iraq to numerous motives .
above all , says joetze , the government holds different political perspectives for the two crisis regions .
in kosovo , the international community was aiming to enforce humanitarian and democratic standards , which can not be transmitted to iraq as easily , joetze maintains .
furthermore , saddam hussein is not considered the only rogue in the region , which is why the government does not believe that a war will improve the situation .
in the case of kosovo , joetze says , germany 's partners in nato expected that the german army , the bundeswehr , would take part in military operations .
the government had little choice but to say " yes , " joetze maintains .
plus , the government had only been in office for a short time and had to prove itself in the realm of foreign policy .
" the social democrats did n't want to start their term in government with discord in the coalition , " joetze insists .
" whereas , for foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the question was a different one .
it was made clear to him -lrb- as the junior partner in the governing coalition -rrb- that he could only remain foreign minister and a governing partner if he towed the same line . "

british prime minister tony blair won his vote in parliament late tuesday .
but he had to put down a revolt within his own labour ranks to do so . prime minister tony blair received his much-needed parliamentary support late tuesday for british participation in a war against iraq , but he had to pay a political price in his own labour party for the victory .
with the support from the opposition , the house of commons strongly endorsed the government 's decision to use " all means necessary " to strip saddam hussein of his weapons of mass destruction .
the decision allows blair to commit the 40,000 british troops in the persian gulf in a war that could begin anytime after the deadline of 2 a.m.
central european time on thursday set by u.s. president george w. bush .
before blair could celebrate his victory , he had to put down a revolt in his own party and defeat an amendment that declared that the case for war " has not yet been established . "
on the surface , the numbers showed that blair was able to handily put down the amendment , 396 to 217 .
but 138 members of his party were among the 217 lawmakers who voted for the measure .
it was the biggest show of dissent blair has faced since coming to power in 1997 and followed a vote last month in which 122 labour lawmakers rebelled against blair 's hawkish stance .
after the first vote on tuesday , the house of commons voted 412 to 149 to approve the government 's resolve to disarm iraq .
the opposition conservatives also backed blair .
unity sought after vote following the votes , labour rebels said it was now time to unite behind blair and support british troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robin cook " i hope that the war will be over quickly , " said robin cook , a senior cabinet member who quit monday over the crisis .
" i hope it will be successful , and i hope all our troops , both the american and british , will be coming back . "
blair staked his career on the need to support military action .
" back away from this confrontation now and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects , " he said in an impassioned speech to lawmakers , as some 200 anti-war protesters demonstrated outside parliament .
blair said far more was at stake than disarming saddam - that the fundamental framework of international relations was being re-examined .
" it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century , " he said .
" it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation . "
he made the impassioned plea to parliament in an effort to shore up his slipping support within his party .
as a result of these protests , two senior cabinet ministers have quit the british government , and a midlevel cabinet minister has resigned as well .
amid the gloom , blair was able to win one small victory .
clare short , britain 's international development secretary , changed her mind about possibly resigning if the prime minister went to war without u.n. backing .
tuesday 's debate was called after the united states , britain and spain withdrew their second resolution in the u.n. security council on sunday and bush gave saddam 48 hours to leave iraq on monday evening .
three u.k. cabinet ministers resign the resignations began on monday with cook -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the house of commons .
junior health minister lord philip hunt and john denham , a mid-ranking british interior minister , followed on tuesday .
in his resignation letter , former foreign secretary cook wrote : " in principle , i believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support . "
he said he believed british " interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . "
cook received a standing ovation for the resignation speech he gave to a packed house of commons .
the next morning , hunt said in an interview on bbc radio 4 that he had " decided to resign from the government today because i don ’ t support the pre-emptive action which is going to be taken without broad international support or indeed the support of the british people . "
a handful of lower-level labour party officials also tendered their resignations on tuesday .
motion questions iraqi compliance the british parliamentarians were considering a motion that stated that iraq had not complied fully with weapons inspectors and is in material breach of u.n. resolution 1441 , the latest resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
therefore , the motion continued , the british government should " use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction . "
on monday , the british government 's top lawyer , attorney general lord goldsmith , said war without a second u.n. resolution would not break international law .
previous u.n. resolutions were sufficient to authorize the use of force against iraq , he said .
a new poll showed that public support for a war against iraq had risen slightly .
disapproval for war fell 8 percentage points to 44 percent , and support rose 9 percentage points to 38 percent .
the icm poll , published in the guardian newspaper on tuesday , said the iraq crisis had not affected labour ’ s poll rating and suggested that the blair " might have gone through the worst and his determination to secure a second u.n. resolution , though unsuccessful , has impressed voters .

before blair could celebrate his victory , he had to put down a revolt in his own party and defeat an amendment that declared that the case for war " has not yet been established . "
on the surface , the numbers showed that blair was able to handily put down the amendment , 396 to 217 .
but 138 members of his party were among the 217 lawmakers who voted for the measure .
it was the biggest show of dissent blair has faced since coming to power in 1997 and followed a vote last month in which 122 labour lawmakers rebelled against blair 's hawkish stance .
after the first vote on tuesday , the house of commons voted 412 to 149 to approve the government 's resolve to disarm iraq .
the opposition conservatives also backed blair .

" i hope it will be successful , and i hope all our troops , both the american and british , will be coming back . "
blair staked his career on the need to support military action .
" back away from this confrontation now and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects , " he said in an impassioned speech to lawmakers , as some 200 anti-war protesters demonstrated outside parliament .
blair said far more was at stake than disarming saddam - that the fundamental framework of international relations was being re-examined .
" it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century , " he said .
" it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation . "
he made the impassioned plea to parliament in an effort to shore up his slipping support within his party .

cook received a standing ovation for the resignation speech he gave to a packed house of commons .

zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday . " i want to tell our friends abroad one thing : what you have begun , what the democratic party has begun , what the serbian government has begun - we wo n't change anything about that ... we wo n't change course , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday .

zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2003 russia , germany , france criticize united states on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in session : the u.n. security council unanimously approved a new iraq resolution last november .
as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .
fischer sees ' no alternative ' to u.n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the security council .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states .
bush aide sees ' many unknowns ' " on the brink of war with iraq , americans should be prepared for what we hope will be as precise , short a conflict as possible , but there are many unknowns and it could be a matter of some duration , " white house press secretary ari fleischer said .
" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .
in ankara , turkey , the new government there also made plans to help the united states conduct the war .
it scheduled a parliamentary vote for thursday on the issue of allowing the united states to use turkish airspace during the attack .
such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .
that request was rejected by the parliament on march 1 , and the decision cost the country at least $ 6 billion in aid .
germans bolster security for americans in germany , the government of gerhard schröder stepped up its security force guarding u.s. facilities in the country from 2,500 soldiers to 3,700 , defense secretary peter struck said on tuesday evening .
but struck rejected a request from the state of baden-württemberg that troops should also be assigned to protect american shopping and housing areas in the country .
the minister said such patrols were the job of police officers .
interior minister otto schily suggested that the war would increase the threat of terrorism in germany .
" the terror network al qaida will mostly react to the war by increasing its terror activities and use it for propaganda purposes , " schily said in a television interview .
" we also have to expect that there will be so-called spontaneous terrorists from the extremist , fundamentalist islamic scene . "
but rolf tophoven , a terrorism reseacher in bonn , said he thought the chances of germany 's becoming a terror target would be small .
" the danger comes from attacks carried out by unknown fanatical individual terrorists , " tophoven said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2003 russia , germany , france criticize united states on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in session : the u.n. security council unanimously approved a new iraq resolution last november .
as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .
fischer sees ' no alternative ' to u.n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the security council .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .

as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .
fischer sees ' no alternative ' to u.n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the security council .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .

as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .

but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .

" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .
in ankara , turkey , the new government there also made plans to help the united states conduct the war .
it scheduled a parliamentary vote for thursday on the issue of allowing the united states to use turkish airspace during the attack .
such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .
that request was rejected by the parliament on march 1 , and the decision cost the country at least $ 6 billion in aid .
germans bolster security for americans in germany , the government of gerhard schröder stepped up its security force guarding u.s. facilities in the country from 2,500 soldiers to 3,700 , defense secretary peter struck said on tuesday evening .
but struck rejected a request from the state of baden-württemberg that troops should also be assigned to protect american shopping and housing areas in the country .
the minister said such patrols were the job of police officers .
interior minister otto schily suggested that the war would increase the threat of terrorism in germany .
" the terror network al qaida will mostly react to the war by increasing its terror activities and use it for propaganda purposes , " schily said in a television interview .
" we also have to expect that there will be so-called spontaneous terrorists from the extremist , fundamentalist islamic scene . "
but rolf tophoven , a terrorism reseacher in bonn , said he thought the chances of germany 's becoming a terror target would be small .

but the country 's opposition parties back bush . in a national address , chancellor gerhard schröder said on tuesday morning that he steadfastly opposed president george w. bush 's just announced ultimatum to iraqi leader saddam hussein and the war that the demand could trigger .
" my question was and remains : does the size of the threat posed by the iraqi dictator justify a decision to wage a war that will surely lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent children , women and men ?
my answer to this question was and remains : no , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush schröder made his television address eight hours after u.s. president george w. bush -lrb- photo -rrb- gave saddam 48 hours to leave his country and told americans that a military confrontation would ultimately make them safer .
" the security of the world requires disarming saddam hussein now , " bush said .
division between americans and germans the issue of war against iraq has driven a wedge between the united states and germany , two allies whose relationship was tightly bound together during four decades of cold war and the reunification of west germany and east germany that followed in 1990 .
schröder began criticizing bush 's plans for a war during the summer as he campaigned for re-election .
as part of his stump speeches , schröder said german troops would not participate in such a war .
he intensified that opposition in january , when he announced that germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
during the address on tuesday , schröder reiterated one position he took during much of the debate .
" iraq is a country that is being extensively inspected by the united nations , " he said .
" the disarmament steps that the security council has demanded are being increasingly implemented .
therefore , there is no reason to break off this process of disarmament . "
schröder delivered the roughly five-minute address while sitting at a desk with his hands folded in front of him .
at his back was a large office window framed by the german and european flags to his right and a plant to his left .
outside on this hazy morning , traffic rolled along a road located not far from the home of the german parliament , the reichstag .
the chancellor concluded the address by pledging to continue to work for peace and security .
" you can be assured that my government will steadfastly use every chance , no matter how small , to achieve world peace .
you can also be assured that we will take every possible measure to ensure security in our country , " he said .
opposition parties back u.s. unlike schröder , germany 's major opposition parties endorsed the course set by bush .
" we regret that the use of military force has become more likely and that the u.n. security council was unable to reach a unified position on the question of completely and unconditionally disarming iraq , even though it unanimously determined that a threat to world peace existed , " a statement said .
the statement was passed on tuesday with only four negative votes by the combined parliamentary groups of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the pending war against saddam 's regime raises a parliamentary question for schröder .
despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .
poles , australians to provide troops in contrast , bush gained the support of other countries after the speech .
poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .
" u.s. president bush has conducted a major undertaking in his search for international support , " koizumi said .
" and in this sense , i think he has made an inevitable decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan turkey 's new prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , also took a step on tuesday toward possible support of the u.s. military .
erdogan said the country 's parliament would reconsider the matter on wednesday or thursday .
the parliament voted on march 1 against allowing the united states to station a force of 62,000 troops who could have invaded iraq across the turkish border .

but the country 's opposition parties back bush . in a national address , chancellor gerhard schröder said on tuesday morning that he steadfastly opposed president george w. bush 's just announced ultimatum to iraqi leader saddam hussein and the war that the demand could trigger .
" my question was and remains : does the size of the threat posed by the iraqi dictator justify a decision to wage a war that will surely lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent children , women and men ?
my answer to this question was and remains : no , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush schröder made his television address eight hours after u.s. president george w. bush -lrb- photo -rrb- gave saddam 48 hours to leave his country and told americans that a military confrontation would ultimately make them safer .
" the security of the world requires disarming saddam hussein now , " bush said .
division between americans and germans the issue of war against iraq has driven a wedge between the united states and germany , two allies whose relationship was tightly bound together during four decades of cold war and the reunification of west germany and east germany that followed in 1990 .
schröder began criticizing bush 's plans for a war during the summer as he campaigned for re-election .
as part of his stump speeches , schröder said german troops would not participate in such a war .
he intensified that opposition in january , when he announced that germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
during the address on tuesday , schröder reiterated one position he took during much of the debate .
" iraq is a country that is being extensively inspected by the united nations , " he said .
" the disarmament steps that the security council has demanded are being increasingly implemented .
therefore , there is no reason to break off this process of disarmament . "
schröder delivered the roughly five-minute address while sitting at a desk with his hands folded in front of him .
at his back was a large office window framed by the german and european flags to his right and a plant to his left .
outside on this hazy morning , traffic rolled along a road located not far from the home of the german parliament , the reichstag .
the chancellor concluded the address by pledging to continue to work for peace and security .
" you can be assured that my government will steadfastly use every chance , no matter how small , to achieve world peace .
you can also be assured that we will take every possible measure to ensure security in our country , " he said .
opposition parties back u.s. unlike schröder , germany 's major opposition parties endorsed the course set by bush .
" we regret that the use of military force has become more likely and that the u.n. security council was unable to reach a unified position on the question of completely and unconditionally disarming iraq , even though it unanimously determined that a threat to world peace existed , " a statement said .
the statement was passed on tuesday with only four negative votes by the combined parliamentary groups of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the pending war against saddam 's regime raises a parliamentary question for schröder .
despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .

poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .
" u.s. president bush has conducted a major undertaking in his search for international support , " koizumi said .
" and in this sense , i think he has made an inevitable decision . "

erdogan said the country 's parliament would reconsider the matter on wednesday or thursday .
the parliament voted on march 1 against allowing the united states to station a force of 62,000 troops who could have invaded iraq across the turkish border .

as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .
fischer sees ' no alternative ' to u.n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the security council .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states .
bush aide sees ' many unknowns ' " on the brink of war with iraq , americans should be prepared for what we hope will be as precise , short a conflict as possible , but there are many unknowns and it could be a matter of some duration , " white house press secretary ari fleischer said .
" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .
in ankara , turkey , the new government there also made plans to help the united states conduct the war .
it scheduled a parliamentary vote for thursday on the issue of allowing the united states to use turkish airspace during the attack .
such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .
that request was rejected by the parliament on march 1 , and the decision cost the country at least $ 6 billion in aid .
germans bolster security for americans in germany , the government of gerhard schröder stepped up its security force guarding u.s. facilities in the country from 2,500 soldiers to 3,700 , defense secretary peter struck said on tuesday evening .
but struck rejected a request from the state of baden-württemberg that troops should also be assigned to protect american shopping and housing areas in the country .
the minister said such patrols were the job of police officers .
interior minister otto schily suggested that the war would increase the threat of terrorism in germany .
" the terror network al qaida will mostly react to the war by increasing its terror activities and use it for propaganda purposes , " schily said in a television interview .
" we also have to expect that there will be so-called spontaneous terrorists from the extremist , fundamentalist islamic scene . "
but rolf tophoven , a terrorism reseacher in bonn , said he thought the chances of germany 's becoming a terror target would be small .
" the danger comes from attacks carried out by unknown fanatical individual terrorists , " tophoven said .
" we are n't the main address for terrorists . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rejects war that will kill ' thousands ' in iraq germany 's chancellor says in a reaction to the united states ' ultimatum that the united nations should be able to continue its inspection program .

as the united states and its allies prepared for war on wednesday , russia , germany and france criticized the u.s. for planning to violently depose iraqi president saddam hussein . hours before a deadline imposed by u.s. president george w. bush for saddam hussein to leave iraq was due to pass , the russian , german and french foreign ministers criticized the united states for planning to overthrow the iraqi president . russian foreign minister igor ivanov said that no u.n. security council resolution authorized the use of force against iraq outside the u.n. charter .
" not one of them authorizes the violent overthrow of the leadership of a sovereign state , " ivanov told the council .
ivanov emphasized that the security council had not received any information to indicate that iraq posed a direct threat to the united states .
if it had been in possession of " indisputable facts " to that effect " then russia , without any hesitation , would use any means available under the u.n. charter to eliminate such a threat , " he said .
mars not venus " there is no basis in the u.n. charter for a regime change with military means , " german foreign minister joschka fischer said in his address to the council .
he stressed that a majority of people in germany and the rest of europe were disturbed by the imminent war .
" those who know our european history understand that we do not live on venus , but , rather that we are the survivors of mars .
war is terrible , " he said .
" it can only be the very last resort . "
in an obvious address to the united states , french foreign minister dominique de villepin too , one of the most vocal critics of military action against iraq , declared , " to those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what is done in iraq , we say that they run the risk of failing in their objective . "
de villepin said it was time for the international community to pull together and apply itself to iraq 's humanitarian needs .
while the three statesmen deplored the end of the weapons inspection program , british ambassador sir jeremy greenstock suggested that disarmament of iraq could be pursued at a later date .
unclear future for disarmament " a more definitive work program -lrb- for u.n. inspectors -rrb- will be possible when there is an administration in iraq , which is prepared to cooperate fully , actively and unconditionally , " he said .
the united states was unwilling to speculate about the future of disarming iraq .
" the fact of the matter is that the situation on the ground will change , and so will the nature of the remaining disarmament tasks , " u.s. ambassador john negroponte told the council .
considering a work program at this time is quite simply out of touch with the reality that we confront . "
the security council meeting was called to discuss the latest plan for the disarmament of iraq prepared by chief weapons inspector hans blix .
once the council began to meet , blix expressed his regret that the inspections were ended and said that his team had not had enough time since they resumed their work in november to determine whether iraq had destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction .
the united states decided to bypass the council and issue a deadline of 2 a.m.
-lrb- central european time -rrb- on thursday for saddam hussein to leave iraq or face war .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell and british foreign secretary jack straw did not attend .
fischer sees ' no alternative ' to u.n. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer addresses the security council .
but german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said the united nations remained an important player in world affairs .
" there is no alternative to the central role of the united nations and to a new world order based on cooperation among the world 's countries , " fischer said .
u.n. sources told the associated press that secretary-general kofi annan would administer a $ 40 billion humanitarian program generated by iraqi oil production , the sources said .
to ensure speedy approval of the plan , annan is supposed to present the proposal to the security council himself , the sources said .
the plan would be an extension of an oil-for-food program created in 1996 to ease the effects of u.n. sanctions imposed on saddam 's regime .
in washington , bush took some of his final steps in preparing to launch the invasion of iraq .
among other things , the white house sent congress formal notification of justification for war .
the three-paragraph document says diplomacy has failed to protect america 's security , and it links saddam 's regime with the al qaida network , implicated in the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the united states .
bush aide sees ' many unknowns ' " on the brink of war with iraq , americans should be prepared for what we hope will be as precise , short a conflict as possible , but there are many unknowns and it could be a matter of some duration , " white house press secretary ari fleischer said .
" americans ought to be prepared for loss of life .
americans ought to be prepared for the importance of disarming saddam hussein to protect the peace . "
the white house had no plans to mark the 8 p.m.
est wednesday deadline .
war wo n't necessarily begin at that time .
aides said bush would decide on the timing of military action based on the advice of military leaders .
in ankara , turkey , the new government there also made plans to help the united states conduct the war .
it scheduled a parliamentary vote for thursday on the issue of allowing the united states to use turkish airspace during the attack .
such assistance falls short of what the united states had asked turkey to provide - permission to station 62,000 american soldiers who could launch a northern front against iraq .
that request was rejected by the parliament on march 1 , and the decision cost the country at least $ 6 billion in aid .
germans bolster security for americans in germany , the government of gerhard schröder stepped up its security force guarding u.s. facilities in the country from 2,500 soldiers to 3,700 , defense secretary peter struck said on tuesday evening .
but struck rejected a request from the state of baden-württemberg that troops should also be assigned to protect american shopping and housing areas in the country .
the minister said such patrols were the job of police officers .
interior minister otto schily suggested that the war would increase the threat of terrorism in germany .
" the terror network al qaida will mostly react to the war by increasing its terror activities and use it for propaganda purposes , " schily said in a television interview .
" we also have to expect that there will be so-called spontaneous terrorists from the extremist , fundamentalist islamic scene . "
but rolf tophoven , a terrorism reseacher in bonn , said he thought the chances of germany 's becoming a terror target would be small .
" the danger comes from attacks carried out by unknown fanatical individual terrorists , " tophoven said .

zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday . " i want to tell our friends abroad one thing : what you have begun , what the democratic party has begun , what the serbian government has begun - we wo n't change anything about that ... we wo n't change course , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

zoran zivkovic took office on tuesday with a vow to nail the killers of his slain reformist predecessor , zoran djindjic .
but filling djindjic 's shoes is likely to prove a tough task . the 250-seat serbian legislature elected 42-year-old zoran zivkovic as the new prime minister of serbia on tuesday .
the pro-western politician and former yugoslav interior minister , zoran zivkovic , was among assassinated prime minister zoran djindjic 's closest allies . djindjic , 50 , who played a key role in toppling former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic and handing him over to the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , was shot dead by a gunman outside the main government building in belgrade on march 12 , 2003 . zivkovic , a deputy leader of the ruling democratic party coalition -lrb- dos -rrb- , was expected to become defense minister in the new loose union of serbia and montenegro , which replaced the old yugoslavia last month .
but with djindjic 's shock killing , zivkovic became the favored candidate to take over the country 's reins given his party 's determination to carry on with the much-needed , western-backed economic and political reforms that had been championed by the slain djindjic . hunting down djindjic 's killers shortly after being sworn in , zivkovic told reporters that tracking down djindjic 's killers would be a priority .
" the most important thing for the serbian government is to find the killers , or the inspirers of zoran djindjic 's murder , the fight against organized crime , " he said . zivkovic , like djindjic a prime opponent of slobodan milosevic during the massacres orchestrated by the dictator during the 1990s , told parliament that police searching for the killers had so far detained more than 750 people in a crackdown targeting 155 known criminal gangs . police said late monday they had arrested two alleged leaders of the belgrade criminal group , which the government has accused of carrying out the killing .
however , suspected ringleaders including a former police commander remain at large . zivkovic vows to stick to economic reforms zivkovic , whom observers view as coldly calculating when it comes to politics , will be watched closely by the international community to continue pro-market economic reforms that the struggling serbian economy desperately needs . zivkovic has assured that the government would remain " on the same path , with the same tasks and unchanged goals . "
but in a sign of challenges ahead , he has already lowered this year 's economic growth forecast from 5.0 to 3.5 percent . less panache than predecessor though his close political allies are convinced that zivkovic is the right man to take over the helm of serbia , doubting voices linger in the country over whether zivkovic can sufficiently fill the vacuum left in djindjic 's absence . the slain premier was widely regarded as a seasoned political operator who could hold his own on the world stage and whose western education and background endeared him to many world leaders . by contrast , zivkovic comes from the small farming province of nis and later moved to belgrade , where he completed a business school education .
compared to djindjic 's polished air , zivkovic is said to display traces of his small-town origins both in his speech and mannerisms . but despite the obvious disadvantages in terms of background and grooming when compared to his predecessor , zivkovic , who is a married father of two , is believed to be an energetic person , with a mind of his own .
he is highly regarded for his resoluteness and determination in decision-making .
he has always made it clear that he may not know the west as well as djindjic did , but he seeks to make up for it with his intimate knowledge of the issues important to serbs . a meteoric rise zivkovic 's rapid rise up the political ladder is undisputed .
he entered the ruling democratic party in 1992 and within months was ensconced in the serbian parliament and became head of the party in his home town of nis . he secured his first political coup in nis , which with 175,000 inhabitants is the third-largest city in the country .
for three months , zivkovic led tens of thousands of demonstrators in protest marches through the streets as part of the opposition 's protest against authoritarian slobodan milosevic . they accused him of rigging the polls in the communal elections .
the protestors made a successful case and zivkovic was appointed the first non-communist mayor of nis . zivkovic then made himself a name as a courageous negotiator and skilled organizer while dealing with the european union and the u.s. as they pumped aid into impoverished opposition communities providing a front against milosevic . that was also one of the reasons zivkovic , a former entrepreneur , was made yugoslav interior minister in 2001 following the regime change .
he made it his mission to castigate the somnambulistic pace of reforms of the police forces in the republic of serbia and threw his weight behind tackling organized crime . zivkovic was also appointed to the national council to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
together with djindjic , he played a major role in handing over suspected war criminals . " we wo n't change course " in a sign that he 's on the right track to reform , zivkovic had a message for the international community after being sworn in as the new serbian prime minister on tuesday .

british prime minister tony blair won his vote in parliament late tuesday .
but he had to put down a revolt within his own labour ranks to do so . prime minister tony blair received his much-needed parliamentary support late tuesday for british participation in a war against iraq , but he had to pay a political price in his own labour party for the victory .
with the support from the opposition , the house of commons strongly endorsed the government 's decision to use " all means necessary " to strip saddam hussein of his weapons of mass destruction .
the decision allows blair to commit the 40,000 british troops in the persian gulf in a war that could begin anytime after the deadline of 2 a.m.
central european time on thursday set by u.s. president george w. bush .
before blair could celebrate his victory , he had to put down a revolt in his own party and defeat an amendment that declared that the case for war " has not yet been established . "
on the surface , the numbers showed that blair was able to handily put down the amendment , 396 to 217 .
but 138 members of his party were among the 217 lawmakers who voted for the measure .
it was the biggest show of dissent blair has faced since coming to power in 1997 and followed a vote last month in which 122 labour lawmakers rebelled against blair 's hawkish stance .
after the first vote on tuesday , the house of commons voted 412 to 149 to approve the government 's resolve to disarm iraq .
the opposition conservatives also backed blair .
unity sought after vote following the votes , labour rebels said it was now time to unite behind blair and support british troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robin cook " i hope that the war will be over quickly , " said robin cook , a senior cabinet member who quit monday over the crisis .
" i hope it will be successful , and i hope all our troops , both the american and british , will be coming back . "
blair staked his career on the need to support military action .
" back away from this confrontation now and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects , " he said in an impassioned speech to lawmakers , as some 200 anti-war protesters demonstrated outside parliament .
blair said far more was at stake than disarming saddam - that the fundamental framework of international relations was being re-examined .
" it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century , " he said .
" it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation . "
he made the impassioned plea to parliament in an effort to shore up his slipping support within his party .
as a result of these protests , two senior cabinet ministers have quit the british government , and a midlevel cabinet minister has resigned as well .
amid the gloom , blair was able to win one small victory .
clare short , britain 's international development secretary , changed her mind about possibly resigning if the prime minister went to war without u.n. backing .
tuesday 's debate was called after the united states , britain and spain withdrew their second resolution in the u.n. security council on sunday and bush gave saddam 48 hours to leave iraq on monday evening .
three u.k. cabinet ministers resign the resignations began on monday with cook -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the house of commons .
junior health minister lord philip hunt and john denham , a mid-ranking british interior minister , followed on tuesday .
in his resignation letter , former foreign secretary cook wrote : " in principle , i believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support . "
he said he believed british " interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . "
cook received a standing ovation for the resignation speech he gave to a packed house of commons .
the next morning , hunt said in an interview on bbc radio 4 that he had " decided to resign from the government today because i don ’ t support the pre-emptive action which is going to be taken without broad international support or indeed the support of the british people . "
a handful of lower-level labour party officials also tendered their resignations on tuesday .
motion questions iraqi compliance the british parliamentarians were considering a motion that stated that iraq had not complied fully with weapons inspectors and is in material breach of u.n. resolution 1441 , the latest resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
therefore , the motion continued , the british government should " use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction . "
on monday , the british government 's top lawyer , attorney general lord goldsmith , said war without a second u.n. resolution would not break international law .
previous u.n. resolutions were sufficient to authorize the use of force against iraq , he said .
a new poll showed that public support for a war against iraq had risen slightly .
disapproval for war fell 8 percentage points to 44 percent , and support rose 9 percentage points to 38 percent .
the icm poll , published in the guardian newspaper on tuesday , said the iraq crisis had not affected labour ’ s poll rating and suggested that the blair " might have gone through the worst and his determination to secure a second u.n. resolution , though unsuccessful , has impressed voters .

british prime minister tony blair won his vote in parliament late tuesday .
but he had to put down a revolt within his own labour ranks to do so . prime minister tony blair received his much-needed parliamentary support late tuesday for british participation in a war against iraq , but he had to pay a political price in his own labour party for the victory .
with the support from the opposition , the house of commons strongly endorsed the government 's decision to use " all means necessary " to strip saddam hussein of his weapons of mass destruction .
the decision allows blair to commit the 40,000 british troops in the persian gulf in a war that could begin anytime after the deadline of 2 a.m.
central european time on thursday set by u.s. president george w. bush .
before blair could celebrate his victory , he had to put down a revolt in his own party and defeat an amendment that declared that the case for war " has not yet been established . "
on the surface , the numbers showed that blair was able to handily put down the amendment , 396 to 217 .
but 138 members of his party were among the 217 lawmakers who voted for the measure .
it was the biggest show of dissent blair has faced since coming to power in 1997 and followed a vote last month in which 122 labour lawmakers rebelled against blair 's hawkish stance .
after the first vote on tuesday , the house of commons voted 412 to 149 to approve the government 's resolve to disarm iraq .
the opposition conservatives also backed blair .
unity sought after vote following the votes , labour rebels said it was now time to unite behind blair and support british troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robin cook " i hope that the war will be over quickly , " said robin cook , a senior cabinet member who quit monday over the crisis .
" i hope it will be successful , and i hope all our troops , both the american and british , will be coming back . "
blair staked his career on the need to support military action .
" back away from this confrontation now and future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects , " he said in an impassioned speech to lawmakers , as some 200 anti-war protesters demonstrated outside parliament .
blair said far more was at stake than disarming saddam - that the fundamental framework of international relations was being re-examined .
" it will determine the way britain and the world confront the central security threat of the 21st century , " he said .
" it will determine the pattern of international politics for the next generation . "
he made the impassioned plea to parliament in an effort to shore up his slipping support within his party .
as a result of these protests , two senior cabinet ministers have quit the british government , and a midlevel cabinet minister has resigned as well .
amid the gloom , blair was able to win one small victory .
clare short , britain 's international development secretary , changed her mind about possibly resigning if the prime minister went to war without u.n. backing .
tuesday 's debate was called after the united states , britain and spain withdrew their second resolution in the u.n. security council on sunday and bush gave saddam 48 hours to leave iraq on monday evening .
three u.k. cabinet ministers resign the resignations began on monday with cook -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the house of commons .
junior health minister lord philip hunt and john denham , a mid-ranking british interior minister , followed on tuesday .
in his resignation letter , former foreign secretary cook wrote : " in principle , i believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support . "
he said he believed british " interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . "
cook received a standing ovation for the resignation speech he gave to a packed house of commons .
the next morning , hunt said in an interview on bbc radio 4 that he had " decided to resign from the government today because i don ’ t support the pre-emptive action which is going to be taken without broad international support or indeed the support of the british people . "
a handful of lower-level labour party officials also tendered their resignations on tuesday .
motion questions iraqi compliance the british parliamentarians were considering a motion that stated that iraq had not complied fully with weapons inspectors and is in material breach of u.n. resolution 1441 , the latest resolution on the disarmament of iraq .
therefore , the motion continued , the british government should " use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction . "
on monday , the british government 's top lawyer , attorney general lord goldsmith , said war without a second u.n. resolution would not break international law .
previous u.n. resolutions were sufficient to authorize the use of force against iraq , he said .
a new poll showed that public support for a war against iraq had risen slightly .
disapproval for war fell 8 percentage points to 44 percent , and support rose 9 percentage points to 38 percent .
the icm poll , published in the guardian newspaper on tuesday , said the iraq crisis had not affected labour ’ s poll rating and suggested that the blair " might have gone through the worst and his determination to secure a second u.n. resolution , though unsuccessful , has impressed voters .

but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ? chancellor schröder somberly addressed the nation on march 24 , 1999 , shortly after nato began bombing yugoslavia .
he announced that his government had made a difficult decision .
" after all , this is the first time since world war ii that german soldiers have been deployed in combat , " he said .
" we are not waging a war , but we must bring about a peaceful solution in kosovo , even if that requires the use of military force . "
schröder explained that this was the reason why the german government had decided to take part in the military campaign against slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today , the same governing coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected involvement in a war against iraq , arguing that military intervention would only serve to further destabilize the middle east .
in 1999 , the government used the opposite argument , maintaining that the balkans would be in greater danger if germany did not act .
explaining the contradiction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr on parade .
" in kosovo , we had a situation of ongoing danger , " social democratic party foreign policy spokeswoman ute zapf told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it was about ethnic expulsion and impending genocide .
now , in iraq , we have a potential threat from iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no immediate danger . "
zapf insisted the problems were very different .
germany 's opposition parties hold a different view .
christoph schmidt , defense spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , criticized the government for committing itself too early to a " no " vote on participation in order to assure shröder 's autumn reelection bid last year .
now , schmidt says , schröder has no maneuvering room to change his position .
" july 2002 was the point of departure , " schmidt explains .
" then schröder tried to take advantage of the mood against military intervention -lrb- in iraq -rrb- for the election campaign .
the price was that other foreign policy options were abandoned .
and now , getting out of that without losing face is hard . "
political perspectives günther joetze believes that neither of these explanations is sufficient .
the former president of the federal academy for security policy has written a book about germany 's role in the kosovo conflict and is working on a new book about its role in the iraq crisis .
joetze ascribes the german government 's differing attitudes toward kosovo and iraq to numerous motives .
above all , says joetze , the government holds different political perspectives for the two crisis regions .
in kosovo , the international community was aiming to enforce humanitarian and democratic standards , which can not be transmitted to iraq as easily , joetze maintains .
furthermore , saddam hussein is not considered the only rogue in the region , which is why the government does not believe that a war will improve the situation .
in the case of kosovo , joetze says , germany 's partners in nato expected that the german army , the bundeswehr , would take part in military operations .
the government had little choice but to say " yes , " joetze maintains .
plus , the government had only been in office for a short time and had to prove itself in the realm of foreign policy .
" the social democrats did n't want to start their term in government with discord in the coalition , " joetze insists .
" whereas , for foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the question was a different one .
it was made clear to him -lrb- as the junior partner in the governing coalition -rrb- that he could only remain foreign minister and a governing partner if he towed the same line . "

-lrb- ap photo -rrb- today , joetze says the government is in a different position - not just because it has been in office for four years , but also because germany is now the second-largest contributor of troops to international peacekeeping operations around the world .

" we are prepared to make our contribution .
we can afford to have another opinion on one particular question . "
" -lrb- in 1999 -rrb- the only international operation the bundeswehr was involved in was the air campaign against yugoslavia .
there were n't any german troops in macedonia or afghanistan yet .
the issue was the first nato troop deployment . "
besides , the mood among the population has changed in the past four years .
then , most germans were in favor of a war against the milosevic regime .
today , the majority rejects a war against saddam hussein .
in that light , joetze defends schröder 's firm position against an iraq war .

but four years ago the bundeswehr took part in nato air strikes on yugoslavia without a u.n. mandate .
so why then and not now ? chancellor schröder somberly addressed the nation on march 24 , 1999 , shortly after nato began bombing yugoslavia .
he announced that his government had made a difficult decision .
" after all , this is the first time since world war ii that german soldiers have been deployed in combat , " he said .
" we are not waging a war , but we must bring about a peaceful solution in kosovo , even if that requires the use of military force . "
schröder explained that this was the reason why the german government had decided to take part in the military campaign against slobodan milosevic 's regime .
today , the same governing coalition of social democrats and greens has rejected involvement in a war against iraq , arguing that military intervention would only serve to further destabilize the middle east .
in 1999 , the government used the opposite argument , maintaining that the balkans would be in greater danger if germany did not act .
explaining the contradiction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr on parade .
" in kosovo , we had a situation of ongoing danger , " social democratic party foreign policy spokeswoman ute zapf told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it was about ethnic expulsion and impending genocide .
now , in iraq , we have a potential threat from iraqi weapons of mass destruction but no immediate danger . "
zapf insisted the problems were very different .
germany 's opposition parties hold a different view .
christoph schmidt , defense spokesman for the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , criticized the government for committing itself too early to a " no " vote on participation in order to assure shröder 's autumn reelection bid last year .
now , schmidt says , schröder has no maneuvering room to change his position .
" july 2002 was the point of departure , " schmidt explains .
" then schröder tried to take advantage of the mood against military intervention -lrb- in iraq -rrb- for the election campaign .
the price was that other foreign policy options were abandoned .
and now , getting out of that without losing face is hard . "
political perspectives günther joetze believes that neither of these explanations is sufficient .
the former president of the federal academy for security policy has written a book about germany 's role in the kosovo conflict and is working on a new book about its role in the iraq crisis .
joetze ascribes the german government 's differing attitudes toward kosovo and iraq to numerous motives .
above all , says joetze , the government holds different political perspectives for the two crisis regions .
in kosovo , the international community was aiming to enforce humanitarian and democratic standards , which can not be transmitted to iraq as easily , joetze maintains .
furthermore , saddam hussein is not considered the only rogue in the region , which is why the government does not believe that a war will improve the situation .
in the case of kosovo , joetze says , germany 's partners in nato expected that the german army , the bundeswehr , would take part in military operations .
the government had little choice but to say " yes , " joetze maintains .
plus , the government had only been in office for a short time and had to prove itself in the realm of foreign policy .
" the social democrats did n't want to start their term in government with discord in the coalition , " joetze insists .
" whereas , for foreign minister joschka fischer of the green party , the question was a different one .
it was made clear to him -lrb- as the junior partner in the governing coalition -rrb- that he could only remain foreign minister and a governing partner if he towed the same line . "

-lrb- ap photo -rrb- today , joetze says the government is in a different position - not just because it has been in office for four years , but also because germany is now the second-largest contributor of troops to international peacekeeping operations around the world .
" the defense minister and the chancellor say we continually prove ourselves to be reliable partners , " joetze says .
" we are prepared to make our contribution .
we can afford to have another opinion on one particular question . "
" -lrb- in 1999 -rrb- the only international operation the bundeswehr was involved in was the air campaign against yugoslavia .
there were n't any german troops in macedonia or afghanistan yet .
the issue was the first nato troop deployment . "
besides , the mood among the population has changed in the past four years .
then , most germans were in favor of a war against the milosevic regime .
today , the majority rejects a war against saddam hussein .
in that light , joetze defends schröder 's firm position against an iraq war .
nor does he find the anti-war stance " reprehensible , " as some members of germany 's opposition government have .

but the country 's opposition parties back bush . in a national address , chancellor gerhard schröder said on tuesday morning that he steadfastly opposed president george w. bush 's just announced ultimatum to iraqi leader saddam hussein and the war that the demand could trigger .
" my question was and remains : does the size of the threat posed by the iraqi dictator justify a decision to wage a war that will surely lead to the deaths of thousands of innocent children , women and men ?
my answer to this question was and remains : no , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush schröder made his television address eight hours after u.s. president george w. bush -lrb- photo -rrb- gave saddam 48 hours to leave his country and told americans that a military confrontation would ultimately make them safer .
" the security of the world requires disarming saddam hussein now , " bush said .
division between americans and germans the issue of war against iraq has driven a wedge between the united states and germany , two allies whose relationship was tightly bound together during four decades of cold war and the reunification of west germany and east germany that followed in 1990 .
schröder began criticizing bush 's plans for a war during the summer as he campaigned for re-election .
as part of his stump speeches , schröder said german troops would not participate in such a war .
he intensified that opposition in january , when he announced that germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
during the address on tuesday , schröder reiterated one position he took during much of the debate .
" iraq is a country that is being extensively inspected by the united nations , " he said .
" the disarmament steps that the security council has demanded are being increasingly implemented .
therefore , there is no reason to break off this process of disarmament . "
schröder delivered the roughly five-minute address while sitting at a desk with his hands folded in front of him .
at his back was a large office window framed by the german and european flags to his right and a plant to his left .
outside on this hazy morning , traffic rolled along a road located not far from the home of the german parliament , the reichstag .
the chancellor concluded the address by pledging to continue to work for peace and security .
" you can be assured that my government will steadfastly use every chance , no matter how small , to achieve world peace .
you can also be assured that we will take every possible measure to ensure security in our country , " he said .
opposition parties back u.s. unlike schröder , germany 's major opposition parties endorsed the course set by bush .
" we regret that the use of military force has become more likely and that the u.n. security council was unable to reach a unified position on the question of completely and unconditionally disarming iraq , even though it unanimously determined that a threat to world peace existed , " a statement said .
the statement was passed on tuesday with only four negative votes by the combined parliamentary groups of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the pending war against saddam 's regime raises a parliamentary question for schröder .
despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .
poles , australians to provide troops in contrast , bush gained the support of other countries after the speech .
poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .
" u.s. president bush has conducted a major undertaking in his search for international support , " koizumi said .
" and in this sense , i think he has made an inevitable decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan turkey 's new prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , also took a step on tuesday toward possible support of the u.s. military .
erdogan said the country 's parliament would reconsider the matter on wednesday or thursday .
the parliament voted on march 1 against allowing the united states to station a force of 62,000 troops who could have invaded iraq across the turkish border .
details about the new plan were not released .
they could include the use of turkish air space during a war , the admission of elite u.s. troops or the old proposal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war could spell doom for iraq 's children in the face of a possible u.s.-led war in iraq , the head of unicef germany has warned of dramatic consequences , especially for millions of iraqi children , thousands of whom are already severely undernourished .

" the security of the world requires disarming saddam hussein now , " bush said .
division between americans and germans the issue of war against iraq has driven a wedge between the united states and germany , two allies whose relationship was tightly bound together during four decades of cold war and the reunification of west germany and east germany that followed in 1990 .
schröder began criticizing bush 's plans for a war during the summer as he campaigned for re-election .
as part of his stump speeches , schröder said german troops would not participate in such a war .
he intensified that opposition in january , when he announced that germany would vote against any u.n. security council resolution authorizing a war against iraq .
during the address on tuesday , schröder reiterated one position he took during much of the debate .
" iraq is a country that is being extensively inspected by the united nations , " he said .
" the disarmament steps that the security council has demanded are being increasingly implemented .
therefore , there is no reason to break off this process of disarmament . "
schröder delivered the roughly five-minute address while sitting at a desk with his hands folded in front of him .
at his back was a large office window framed by the german and european flags to his right and a plant to his left .
outside on this hazy morning , traffic rolled along a road located not far from the home of the german parliament , the reichstag .
the chancellor concluded the address by pledging to continue to work for peace and security .
" you can be assured that my government will steadfastly use every chance , no matter how small , to achieve world peace .
you can also be assured that we will take every possible measure to ensure security in our country , " he said .
opposition parties back u.s. unlike schröder , germany 's major opposition parties endorsed the course set by bush .
" we regret that the use of military force has become more likely and that the u.n. security council was unable to reach a unified position on the question of completely and unconditionally disarming iraq , even though it unanimously determined that a threat to world peace existed , " a statement said .
the statement was passed on tuesday with only four negative votes by the combined parliamentary groups of the christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the pending war against saddam 's regime raises a parliamentary question for schröder .
despite his opposition to the conflict , schröder has sent german air crews to serve on nato surveillance flights as part of the alliance 's support of turkey , its member that borders iraq .
members of the opposition maintain that the parliament needs to approve such mission .
the chancellor says the vote is unnecessary , and he plans to discuss the issue on wednesday in the parliament .
chirac joins criticism of u.s. schröder was joined in his opposition to bush 's latest plans by jacques chirac , the french president who had threatened to veto the american drive for war in the u.n. security council .
" this one-sided decision contradicts the will of the security council and the international community , " chirac said in a statement released on tuesday .
in moscow , the country 's parliament protested bush 's decision by postponing indefinitely a vote on an american-russian nuclear disarmament treaty .
like france , russia had pledged to use its veto to sidetrack a resolution authorizing a war .
poles , australians to provide troops in contrast , bush gained the support of other countries after the speech .
poland , a nato ally , will deploy 200 elite troops to the region , and australia said it would commit the 2,000 soldiers it has already sent to the persian gulf region .
the prime minister of japan , junichiro koizumi , also endorsed bush 's plans .
" u.s. president bush has conducted a major undertaking in his search for international support , " koizumi said .
" and in this sense , i think he has made an inevitable decision . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan turkey 's new prime minister , recep tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- , also took a step on tuesday toward possible support of the u.s. military .
erdogan said the country 's parliament would reconsider the matter on wednesday or thursday .
the parliament voted on march 1 against allowing the united states to station a force of 62,000 troops who could have invaded iraq across the turkish border .
details about the new plan were not released .
they could include the use of turkish air space during a war , the admission of elite u.s. troops or the old proposal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war could spell doom for iraq 's children in the face of a possible u.s.-led war in iraq , the head of unicef germany has warned of dramatic consequences , especially for millions of iraqi children , thousands of whom are already severely undernourished .

it follows last year 's first phase which brought new or refurbished schools to 15 local authorities .

" that is why we are taking action to address the legacy of under-investment in school buildings .
" pupils deserve to learn in modern classrooms and teachers deserve to work in well-designed , well-equipped buildings . "

scottish national party education spokesman mike russell said the drive smacked of " desperation " by labour ahead of the election .

pupils deserve to learn in modern classrooms cathy jamieson education minister public private partnerships mean that private companies carry out the work on behalf of the council and are paid back over a period of up to 30 years .
ms jamieson said : " it is simply unacceptable that at present there are some school buildings which are not meeting the needs of pupils and teachers in the 21st century .
" that is why we are taking action to address the legacy of under-investment in school buildings .
" pupils deserve to learn in modern classrooms and teachers deserve to work in well-designed , well-equipped buildings . "
fourteen local authorities submitted bids for the second phase of investment and the scottish executive is offering ppp cash to nine of those .
' desperate ' move the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- welcomed the announcement , but called on the executive to commit to " sustainable , additional long-term funding " .
cosla 's education spokeswoman helen law said : " such major investment is very welcome and it is essential that flexibility is given to the nine successful councils to address their local needs on a best value basis . "
scottish national party education spokesman mike russell said the drive smacked of " desperation " by labour ahead of the election .
" it also indicates the extent of labour 's failure in that so much needs to be done to make our schools fit for the 21st century , " he said .

" there was an agreement between japan and the us to take action co-operatively in foreign exchange , stocks and other markets if the markets face a crisis , " chief cabinet secretary yasuo fukuda said .

finance and economics minister heizo takenaka said the bank of japan and stock exchanges would be watching the markets closely during the current iraq crisis .

in an official statement read out on state television , the authorities accused the representative , james cason , of " subversive " activities .
president fidel castro has made no secret of his dislike for mr cason - describing him last week as a " bully " and a " liar " .
the cuban government also announced on tuesday that it was restricting the movements of us diplomats , in response to similar measures imposed on cuban diplomats in washington .
the two neighbours have not maintained formal diplomatic relations for more than 40 years , but the us does have a limited diplomatic presence in havana .
