royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen . no , it 's not the scandal prone british royals ' latest round of indiscretions .
nor is it another feud in monaco .
the gossip keeping the tongues of royal watchers wagging these days - allegations of secret bugging , a smear campaign , an illegitimate child - have centered on the usually teflon-coated dutch royal family , namely its matriarch queen beatrix . more than just fueling newspaper sales , the scandal has now drawn the attention of the dutch parliament , which convened a special hearing on tuesday to debate whether the queen was guilty of abusing her power .
the alleged victim of the queen 's wrongdoing , her niece , has demanded a public apology and filed a lawsuit against former prime minister wim kok . a drama played out in the headlines the saga began last month when princess margarita de bourbon de parme gave a series of interviews to the dutch magazine hp / de tijd .
one article , however , was not enough to contain this princess ' litany of accusations .
the magazine ran a special four-part series titled " orange bitters , " chronicling margarita 's misadventures in the house of orange .
" i was loyal to my family my entire life , but the moment i expected support there was none , " she said . the articles were followed by a television interview , adding fuel to the fire and reminding many of princess diana 's historic appearance on the bbc at the height of her marital troubles with prince charles .
" they abuse power and that 's not right , " margarita said in the television interview . among princess margarita 's accusations are claims that the queen 's late father , prince bernhard , had a 20-year affair with his secretary and that her own father had an illegitimate child with a nanny .
but these nuggets of scandal were just bonus disclosures made by a chatty royal driven to talk by her own perceived suffering at the hands of a woman she paints as the queen of mean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess margarita and husband edwin de roy van zuydewijn margarita -lrb- photo -rrb- says beatrix ordered the dutch secret service to tap her home and private conversations with her husband , edwin de roy van zuydewijn , a commoner whom she married last year .
according to the princess , the queen was unhappy with her choice of husband and hoped to use the information to ruin his name and business , thereby prompting a split .
this information , she says , was shared with members of her family , including her father and brother . what 's more , princess margarita , daughter of the queen 's sister , princess irene -lrb- who gave up her claim to the throne to marry a spanish aristocrat -rrb- , says she was deliberately excluded from family events .
indeed , since the princess is fourth in line to the throne , her absences from the wedding of crown prince willem-alexander and the funeral of queen beatrix 's husband , prince klaus , last year were notable . the princess suspected that negative press reports were based on information illegally obtained by her own family and appealed to the country 's then prime minister , wim kok , for help before going to the press herself . seeking an explanation early on , the netherlands ' current prime minister , jan-peter balkenende , tried to put a damper on the story .
he appealed to the parties involved to work things out and put this episode behind them .
" it ca n't go on like this : the public offensive must stop , " balkenende said .
" it 's painful to watch , and it 's bad for the country 's image . " but margarita and her husband have not been so easily appeased and are willing to see this through .
" the queen must apologize to us publicly , " zuydewijn told the german magazine stern .
" we will not be satisfied with less . "
that and € 33.7 million -lrb- $ 36.3 million -rrb- in damages from the queen for ruining his reputation and business interests . on tuesday , they filed a lawsuit against kok , accusing him of fraud , forgery and the divulging of professional secrets . and though balkenende initially played down the allegations , he has since acknowledged that the information service looked into zuydewijn 's background at the queen 's request .
he claimed this is standard procedure for someone marrying into the royal family .
still , he conceded it was a mistake that the ministers in charge of the two departments involved - the justice and interior ministries - were not informed of the investigation .
he has since withdrawn the queen 's power to request an inquiry without his personal consent . nonetheless , dutch parliamentarians were not satisfied by balkenende 's explanation of the queen 's actions and called a special hearing on tuesday to discuss the matter . thom de graaf , a parliamentarian from the centrist d66 party , told the dutch newspaper het financieele dagblad that balkenende 's explanation was not enough .
the secret service could only investigate zuydewijn if he were a potential threat to the democratic rule of law , for which there was no evidence . others found it difficult to understand how certain details were leaked to the princess ' father and brother , yet the heads of the justice and interior ministries were not informed of these activities .
the algemeen dagblad , a dutch daily , said the current crisis could have " constitutional undertones " for the country . a first for the dutch for now at least , dutch royal watchers who may have found their own home-grown royals a bit of a snooze in the scandal department no longer have to look across the channel for fodder .
" it struck like a bombshell , " fred lammers , a biographer of beatrix and prince bernhard told the associated press .
" in britain , when servants leave the court the first thing they do is write a book .
here , nobody leaks anything . " this sign-of-the-times has likely not pleased queen beatrix .
the royal family has denied the allegations , making just one statement thus far - released shortly after the initial magazine interviews - stating that it was surprised by the accusations and did n't care to comment further because of " love for the princess . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.03.2003 schröder calls for germans to prepare for sacrifices großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling for courage : chancellor gerhard schröder addresses the parliament on friday in a special speech on friday , germany 's chancellor told citizens that the only way out of the country 's economic doldrums is a sweeping reform that will be painful for many .
the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .
as a result , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel after schröder had finished his roughly 90-minute talk and the members of his coalition had completed their standing ovation , the leader of the country 's biggest opposition party responded to the speech .
" that is surely not a major master plan for the federal republic of germany , " said angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the christian democratic union .
merkel said she doubted that schröder recognized the depths of germany 's problems and seemed to be focusing on " administering the moment . "
speech produces criticism disappointment about the speech spread through the unions and business community as well .
" we are bitterly disappointed , " said michael sommer , leader of the german trade union federation .
sommer said the disappointment applied particularly to the cuts in jobless benefits for older workers .
" that is a point that we can not and will not accept , " he said .
horst siebert , who heads the kiel institute for world economics , also expressed doubts about the labor reforms .
" there will be only a marginal improvement on the job market , " siebert said .
" furthermore , the chance of implementation is low . "
the chancellor had one other critic who had nothing to do with the political debate : the president of the german association of speech writers .
" the speech was dry and delivered with little emotion , " thilo von trotha said .
" that was nothing . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's jobless rate jumps again the number of germans thrown out of work in february climbed to 4.7 million .

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .
as a result , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel after schröder had finished his roughly 90-minute talk and the members of his coalition had completed their standing ovation , the leader of the country 's biggest opposition party responded to the speech .

merkel said she doubted that schröder recognized the depths of germany 's problems and seemed to be focusing on " administering the moment . "
speech produces criticism disappointment about the speech spread through the unions and business community as well .
" we are bitterly disappointed , " said michael sommer , leader of the german trade union federation .
sommer said the disappointment applied particularly to the cuts in jobless benefits for older workers .
" that is a point that we can not and will not accept , " he said .
horst siebert , who heads the kiel institute for world economics , also expressed doubts about the labor reforms .
" there will be only a marginal improvement on the job market , " siebert said .
" furthermore , the chance of implementation is low . "

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .
" immigration and integration are two sides of the same coin , " he said .
" that 's why they both have to be regulated .

" you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .
" immigration and integration are two sides of the same coin , " he said .

royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen . no , it 's not the scandal prone british royals ' latest round of indiscretions .
nor is it another feud in monaco .
the gossip keeping the tongues of royal watchers wagging these days - allegations of secret bugging , a smear campaign , an illegitimate child - have centered on the usually teflon-coated dutch royal family , namely its matriarch queen beatrix . more than just fueling newspaper sales , the scandal has now drawn the attention of the dutch parliament , which convened a special hearing on tuesday to debate whether the queen was guilty of abusing her power .
the alleged victim of the queen 's wrongdoing , her niece , has demanded a public apology and filed a lawsuit against former prime minister wim kok . a drama played out in the headlines the saga began last month when princess margarita de bourbon de parme gave a series of interviews to the dutch magazine hp / de tijd .
one article , however , was not enough to contain this princess ' litany of accusations .
the magazine ran a special four-part series titled " orange bitters , " chronicling margarita 's misadventures in the house of orange .
" i was loyal to my family my entire life , but the moment i expected support there was none , " she said . the articles were followed by a television interview , adding fuel to the fire and reminding many of princess diana 's historic appearance on the bbc at the height of her marital troubles with prince charles .
" they abuse power and that 's not right , " margarita said in the television interview . among princess margarita 's accusations are claims that the queen 's late father , prince bernhard , had a 20-year affair with his secretary and that her own father had an illegitimate child with a nanny .
but these nuggets of scandal were just bonus disclosures made by a chatty royal driven to talk by her own perceived suffering at the hands of a woman she paints as the queen of mean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess margarita and husband edwin de roy van zuydewijn margarita -lrb- photo -rrb- says beatrix ordered the dutch secret service to tap her home and private conversations with her husband , edwin de roy van zuydewijn , a commoner whom she married last year .
according to the princess , the queen was unhappy with her choice of husband and hoped to use the information to ruin his name and business , thereby prompting a split .
this information , she says , was shared with members of her family , including her father and brother . what 's more , princess margarita , daughter of the queen 's sister , princess irene -lrb- who gave up her claim to the throne to marry a spanish aristocrat -rrb- , says she was deliberately excluded from family events .
indeed , since the princess is fourth in line to the throne , her absences from the wedding of crown prince willem-alexander and the funeral of queen beatrix 's husband , prince klaus , last year were notable . the princess suspected that negative press reports were based on information illegally obtained by her own family and appealed to the country 's then prime minister , wim kok , for help before going to the press herself . seeking an explanation early on , the netherlands ' current prime minister , jan-peter balkenende , tried to put a damper on the story .
he appealed to the parties involved to work things out and put this episode behind them .
" it ca n't go on like this : the public offensive must stop , " balkenende said .
" it 's painful to watch , and it 's bad for the country 's image . " but margarita and her husband have not been so easily appeased and are willing to see this through .
" the queen must apologize to us publicly , " zuydewijn told the german magazine stern .
" we will not be satisfied with less . "
that and € 33.7 million -lrb- $ 36.3 million -rrb- in damages from the queen for ruining his reputation and business interests . on tuesday , they filed a lawsuit against kok , accusing him of fraud , forgery and the divulging of professional secrets . and though balkenende initially played down the allegations , he has since acknowledged that the information service looked into zuydewijn 's background at the queen 's request .
he claimed this is standard procedure for someone marrying into the royal family .
still , he conceded it was a mistake that the ministers in charge of the two departments involved - the justice and interior ministries - were not informed of the investigation .
he has since withdrawn the queen 's power to request an inquiry without his personal consent . nonetheless , dutch parliamentarians were not satisfied by balkenende 's explanation of the queen 's actions and called a special hearing on tuesday to discuss the matter . thom de graaf , a parliamentarian from the centrist d66 party , told the dutch newspaper het financieele dagblad that balkenende 's explanation was not enough .
the secret service could only investigate zuydewijn if he were a potential threat to the democratic rule of law , for which there was no evidence . others found it difficult to understand how certain details were leaked to the princess ' father and brother , yet the heads of the justice and interior ministries were not informed of these activities .
the algemeen dagblad , a dutch daily , said the current crisis could have " constitutional undertones " for the country . a first for the dutch for now at least , dutch royal watchers who may have found their own home-grown royals a bit of a snooze in the scandal department no longer have to look across the channel for fodder .
" it struck like a bombshell , " fred lammers , a biographer of beatrix and prince bernhard told the associated press .
" in britain , when servants leave the court the first thing they do is write a book .
here , nobody leaks anything . " this sign-of-the-times has likely not pleased queen beatrix .
the royal family has denied the allegations , making just one statement thus far - released shortly after the initial magazine interviews - stating that it was surprised by the accusations and did n't care to comment further because of " love for the princess . "
but many parliamentarians - and the princess - are hoping the queen will soon have more to say - by way of a reasonable explanation or public apology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

he has since withdrawn the queen 's power to request an inquiry without his personal consent . nonetheless , dutch parliamentarians were not satisfied by balkenende 's explanation of the queen 's actions and called a special hearing on tuesday to discuss the matter . thom de graaf , a parliamentarian from the centrist d66 party , told the dutch newspaper het financieele dagblad that balkenende 's explanation was not enough .
the secret service could only investigate zuydewijn if he were a potential threat to the democratic rule of law , for which there was no evidence . others found it difficult to understand how certain details were leaked to the princess ' father and brother , yet the heads of the justice and interior ministries were not informed of these activities .
the algemeen dagblad , a dutch daily , said the current crisis could have " constitutional undertones " for the country . a first for the dutch for now at least , dutch royal watchers who may have found their own home-grown royals a bit of a snooze in the scandal department no longer have to look across the channel for fodder .
" it struck like a bombshell , " fred lammers , a biographer of beatrix and prince bernhard told the associated press .
" in britain , when servants leave the court the first thing they do is write a book .
here , nobody leaks anything . " this sign-of-the-times has likely not pleased queen beatrix .
the royal family has denied the allegations , making just one statement thus far - released shortly after the initial magazine interviews - stating that it was surprised by the accusations and did n't care to comment further because of " love for the princess . "
but many parliamentarians - and the princess - are hoping the queen will soon have more to say - by way of a reasonable explanation or public apology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .

berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .
" immigration and integration are two sides of the same coin , " he said .

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .
as a result , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel after schröder had finished his roughly 90-minute talk and the members of his coalition had completed their standing ovation , the leader of the country 's biggest opposition party responded to the speech .
" that is surely not a major master plan for the federal republic of germany , " said angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the christian democratic union .
merkel said she doubted that schröder recognized the depths of germany 's problems and seemed to be focusing on " administering the moment . "
speech produces criticism disappointment about the speech spread through the unions and business community as well .
" we are bitterly disappointed , " said michael sommer , leader of the german trade union federation .
sommer said the disappointment applied particularly to the cuts in jobless benefits for older workers .
" that is a point that we can not and will not accept , " he said .
horst siebert , who heads the kiel institute for world economics , also expressed doubts about the labor reforms .
" there will be only a marginal improvement on the job market , " siebert said .
" furthermore , the chance of implementation is low . "
the chancellor had one other critic who had nothing to do with the political debate : the president of the german association of speech writers .

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .
" immigration and integration are two sides of the same coin , " he said .
" that 's why they both have to be regulated .

royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen . no , it 's not the scandal prone british royals ' latest round of indiscretions .
nor is it another feud in monaco .
the gossip keeping the tongues of royal watchers wagging these days - allegations of secret bugging , a smear campaign , an illegitimate child - have centered on the usually teflon-coated dutch royal family , namely its matriarch queen beatrix . more than just fueling newspaper sales , the scandal has now drawn the attention of the dutch parliament , which convened a special hearing on tuesday to debate whether the queen was guilty of abusing her power .
the alleged victim of the queen 's wrongdoing , her niece , has demanded a public apology and filed a lawsuit against former prime minister wim kok . a drama played out in the headlines the saga began last month when princess margarita de bourbon de parme gave a series of interviews to the dutch magazine hp / de tijd .
one article , however , was not enough to contain this princess ' litany of accusations .
the magazine ran a special four-part series titled " orange bitters , " chronicling margarita 's misadventures in the house of orange .
" i was loyal to my family my entire life , but the moment i expected support there was none , " she said . the articles were followed by a television interview , adding fuel to the fire and reminding many of princess diana 's historic appearance on the bbc at the height of her marital troubles with prince charles .
" they abuse power and that 's not right , " margarita said in the television interview . among princess margarita 's accusations are claims that the queen 's late father , prince bernhard , had a 20-year affair with his secretary and that her own father had an illegitimate child with a nanny .
but these nuggets of scandal were just bonus disclosures made by a chatty royal driven to talk by her own perceived suffering at the hands of a woman she paints as the queen of mean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess margarita and husband edwin de roy van zuydewijn margarita -lrb- photo -rrb- says beatrix ordered the dutch secret service to tap her home and private conversations with her husband , edwin de roy van zuydewijn , a commoner whom she married last year .

he appealed to the parties involved to work things out and put this episode behind them .
" it ca n't go on like this : the public offensive must stop , " balkenende said .

royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen . no , it 's not the scandal prone british royals ' latest round of indiscretions .
nor is it another feud in monaco .
the gossip keeping the tongues of royal watchers wagging these days - allegations of secret bugging , a smear campaign , an illegitimate child - have centered on the usually teflon-coated dutch royal family , namely its matriarch queen beatrix . more than just fueling newspaper sales , the scandal has now drawn the attention of the dutch parliament , which convened a special hearing on tuesday to debate whether the queen was guilty of abusing her power .
the alleged victim of the queen 's wrongdoing , her niece , has demanded a public apology and filed a lawsuit against former prime minister wim kok . a drama played out in the headlines the saga began last month when princess margarita de bourbon de parme gave a series of interviews to the dutch magazine hp / de tijd .
one article , however , was not enough to contain this princess ' litany of accusations .
the magazine ran a special four-part series titled " orange bitters , " chronicling margarita 's misadventures in the house of orange .
" i was loyal to my family my entire life , but the moment i expected support there was none , " she said . the articles were followed by a television interview , adding fuel to the fire and reminding many of princess diana 's historic appearance on the bbc at the height of her marital troubles with prince charles .
" they abuse power and that 's not right , " margarita said in the television interview . among princess margarita 's accusations are claims that the queen 's late father , prince bernhard , had a 20-year affair with his secretary and that her own father had an illegitimate child with a nanny .
but these nuggets of scandal were just bonus disclosures made by a chatty royal driven to talk by her own perceived suffering at the hands of a woman she paints as the queen of mean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess margarita and husband edwin de roy van zuydewijn margarita -lrb- photo -rrb- says beatrix ordered the dutch secret service to tap her home and private conversations with her husband , edwin de roy van zuydewijn , a commoner whom she married last year .
according to the princess , the queen was unhappy with her choice of husband and hoped to use the information to ruin his name and business , thereby prompting a split .
this information , she says , was shared with members of her family , including her father and brother . what 's more , princess margarita , daughter of the queen 's sister , princess irene -lrb- who gave up her claim to the throne to marry a spanish aristocrat -rrb- , says she was deliberately excluded from family events .
indeed , since the princess is fourth in line to the throne , her absences from the wedding of crown prince willem-alexander and the funeral of queen beatrix 's husband , prince klaus , last year were notable . the princess suspected that negative press reports were based on information illegally obtained by her own family and appealed to the country 's then prime minister , wim kok , for help before going to the press herself . seeking an explanation early on , the netherlands ' current prime minister , jan-peter balkenende , tried to put a damper on the story .
he appealed to the parties involved to work things out and put this episode behind them .
" it ca n't go on like this : the public offensive must stop , " balkenende said .
" it 's painful to watch , and it 's bad for the country 's image . " but margarita and her husband have not been so easily appeased and are willing to see this through .
" the queen must apologize to us publicly , " zuydewijn told the german magazine stern .
" we will not be satisfied with less . "
that and € 33.7 million -lrb- $ 36.3 million -rrb- in damages from the queen for ruining his reputation and business interests . on tuesday , they filed a lawsuit against kok , accusing him of fraud , forgery and the divulging of professional secrets . and though balkenende initially played down the allegations , he has since acknowledged that the information service looked into zuydewijn 's background at the queen 's request .
he claimed this is standard procedure for someone marrying into the royal family .
still , he conceded it was a mistake that the ministers in charge of the two departments involved - the justice and interior ministries - were not informed of the investigation .
he has since withdrawn the queen 's power to request an inquiry without his personal consent . nonetheless , dutch parliamentarians were not satisfied by balkenende 's explanation of the queen 's actions and called a special hearing on tuesday to discuss the matter . thom de graaf , a parliamentarian from the centrist d66 party , told the dutch newspaper het financieele dagblad that balkenende 's explanation was not enough .
the secret service could only investigate zuydewijn if he were a potential threat to the democratic rule of law , for which there was no evidence . others found it difficult to understand how certain details were leaked to the princess ' father and brother , yet the heads of the justice and interior ministries were not informed of these activities .
the algemeen dagblad , a dutch daily , said the current crisis could have " constitutional undertones " for the country . a first for the dutch for now at least , dutch royal watchers who may have found their own home-grown royals a bit of a snooze in the scandal department no longer have to look across the channel for fodder .
" it struck like a bombshell , " fred lammers , a biographer of beatrix and prince bernhard told the associated press .

royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen . no , it 's not the scandal prone british royals ' latest round of indiscretions .
nor is it another feud in monaco .
the gossip keeping the tongues of royal watchers wagging these days - allegations of secret bugging , a smear campaign , an illegitimate child - have centered on the usually teflon-coated dutch royal family , namely its matriarch queen beatrix . more than just fueling newspaper sales , the scandal has now drawn the attention of the dutch parliament , which convened a special hearing on tuesday to debate whether the queen was guilty of abusing her power .
the alleged victim of the queen 's wrongdoing , her niece , has demanded a public apology and filed a lawsuit against former prime minister wim kok . a drama played out in the headlines the saga began last month when princess margarita de bourbon de parme gave a series of interviews to the dutch magazine hp / de tijd .
one article , however , was not enough to contain this princess ' litany of accusations .
the magazine ran a special four-part series titled " orange bitters , " chronicling margarita 's misadventures in the house of orange .
" i was loyal to my family my entire life , but the moment i expected support there was none , " she said . the articles were followed by a television interview , adding fuel to the fire and reminding many of princess diana 's historic appearance on the bbc at the height of her marital troubles with prince charles .
" they abuse power and that 's not right , " margarita said in the television interview . among princess margarita 's accusations are claims that the queen 's late father , prince bernhard , had a 20-year affair with his secretary and that her own father had an illegitimate child with a nanny .
but these nuggets of scandal were just bonus disclosures made by a chatty royal driven to talk by her own perceived suffering at the hands of a woman she paints as the queen of mean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess margarita and husband edwin de roy van zuydewijn margarita -lrb- photo -rrb- says beatrix ordered the dutch secret service to tap her home and private conversations with her husband , edwin de roy van zuydewijn , a commoner whom she married last year .
according to the princess , the queen was unhappy with her choice of husband and hoped to use the information to ruin his name and business , thereby prompting a split .
this information , she says , was shared with members of her family , including her father and brother . what 's more , princess margarita , daughter of the queen 's sister , princess irene -lrb- who gave up her claim to the throne to marry a spanish aristocrat -rrb- , says she was deliberately excluded from family events .
indeed , since the princess is fourth in line to the throne , her absences from the wedding of crown prince willem-alexander and the funeral of queen beatrix 's husband , prince klaus , last year were notable . the princess suspected that negative press reports were based on information illegally obtained by her own family and appealed to the country 's then prime minister , wim kok , for help before going to the press herself . seeking an explanation early on , the netherlands ' current prime minister , jan-peter balkenende , tried to put a damper on the story .
he appealed to the parties involved to work things out and put this episode behind them .
" it ca n't go on like this : the public offensive must stop , " balkenende said .
" it 's painful to watch , and it 's bad for the country 's image . " but margarita and her husband have not been so easily appeased and are willing to see this through .
" the queen must apologize to us publicly , " zuydewijn told the german magazine stern .
" we will not be satisfied with less . "
that and € 33.7 million -lrb- $ 36.3 million -rrb- in damages from the queen for ruining his reputation and business interests . on tuesday , they filed a lawsuit against kok , accusing him of fraud , forgery and the divulging of professional secrets . and though balkenende initially played down the allegations , he has since acknowledged that the information service looked into zuydewijn 's background at the queen 's request .
he claimed this is standard procedure for someone marrying into the royal family .
still , he conceded it was a mistake that the ministers in charge of the two departments involved - the justice and interior ministries - were not informed of the investigation .
he has since withdrawn the queen 's power to request an inquiry without his personal consent . nonetheless , dutch parliamentarians were not satisfied by balkenende 's explanation of the queen 's actions and called a special hearing on tuesday to discuss the matter . thom de graaf , a parliamentarian from the centrist d66 party , told the dutch newspaper het financieele dagblad that balkenende 's explanation was not enough .

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .
" immigration and integration are two sides of the same coin , " he said .
" that 's why they both have to be regulated .

royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen . no , it 's not the scandal prone british royals ' latest round of indiscretions .
nor is it another feud in monaco .
the gossip keeping the tongues of royal watchers wagging these days - allegations of secret bugging , a smear campaign , an illegitimate child - have centered on the usually teflon-coated dutch royal family , namely its matriarch queen beatrix . more than just fueling newspaper sales , the scandal has now drawn the attention of the dutch parliament , which convened a special hearing on tuesday to debate whether the queen was guilty of abusing her power .
the alleged victim of the queen 's wrongdoing , her niece , has demanded a public apology and filed a lawsuit against former prime minister wim kok . a drama played out in the headlines the saga began last month when princess margarita de bourbon de parme gave a series of interviews to the dutch magazine hp / de tijd .
one article , however , was not enough to contain this princess ' litany of accusations .
the magazine ran a special four-part series titled " orange bitters , " chronicling margarita 's misadventures in the house of orange .
" i was loyal to my family my entire life , but the moment i expected support there was none , " she said . the articles were followed by a television interview , adding fuel to the fire and reminding many of princess diana 's historic appearance on the bbc at the height of her marital troubles with prince charles .
" they abuse power and that 's not right , " margarita said in the television interview . among princess margarita 's accusations are claims that the queen 's late father , prince bernhard , had a 20-year affair with his secretary and that her own father had an illegitimate child with a nanny .
but these nuggets of scandal were just bonus disclosures made by a chatty royal driven to talk by her own perceived suffering at the hands of a woman she paints as the queen of mean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess margarita and husband edwin de roy van zuydewijn margarita -lrb- photo -rrb- says beatrix ordered the dutch secret service to tap her home and private conversations with her husband , edwin de roy van zuydewijn , a commoner whom she married last year .
according to the princess , the queen was unhappy with her choice of husband and hoped to use the information to ruin his name and business , thereby prompting a split .
this information , she says , was shared with members of her family , including her father and brother . what 's more , princess margarita , daughter of the queen 's sister , princess irene -lrb- who gave up her claim to the throne to marry a spanish aristocrat -rrb- , says she was deliberately excluded from family events .
indeed , since the princess is fourth in line to the throne , her absences from the wedding of crown prince willem-alexander and the funeral of queen beatrix 's husband , prince klaus , last year were notable . the princess suspected that negative press reports were based on information illegally obtained by her own family and appealed to the country 's then prime minister , wim kok , for help before going to the press herself . seeking an explanation early on , the netherlands ' current prime minister , jan-peter balkenende , tried to put a damper on the story .
he appealed to the parties involved to work things out and put this episode behind them .
" it ca n't go on like this : the public offensive must stop , " balkenende said .
" it 's painful to watch , and it 's bad for the country 's image . " but margarita and her husband have not been so easily appeased and are willing to see this through .
" the queen must apologize to us publicly , " zuydewijn told the german magazine stern .
" we will not be satisfied with less . "
that and € 33.7 million -lrb- $ 36.3 million -rrb- in damages from the queen for ruining his reputation and business interests . on tuesday , they filed a lawsuit against kok , accusing him of fraud , forgery and the divulging of professional secrets . and though balkenende initially played down the allegations , he has since acknowledged that the information service looked into zuydewijn 's background at the queen 's request .
he claimed this is standard procedure for someone marrying into the royal family .
still , he conceded it was a mistake that the ministers in charge of the two departments involved - the justice and interior ministries - were not informed of the investigation .
he has since withdrawn the queen 's power to request an inquiry without his personal consent . nonetheless , dutch parliamentarians were not satisfied by balkenende 's explanation of the queen 's actions and called a special hearing on tuesday to discuss the matter . thom de graaf , a parliamentarian from the centrist d66 party , told the dutch newspaper het financieele dagblad that balkenende 's explanation was not enough .
the secret service could only investigate zuydewijn if he were a potential threat to the democratic rule of law , for which there was no evidence . others found it difficult to understand how certain details were leaked to the princess ' father and brother , yet the heads of the justice and interior ministries were not informed of these activities .
the algemeen dagblad , a dutch daily , said the current crisis could have " constitutional undertones " for the country . a first for the dutch for now at least , dutch royal watchers who may have found their own home-grown royals a bit of a snooze in the scandal department no longer have to look across the channel for fodder .
" it struck like a bombshell , " fred lammers , a biographer of beatrix and prince bernhard told the associated press .
" in britain , when servants leave the court the first thing they do is write a book .
here , nobody leaks anything . " this sign-of-the-times has likely not pleased queen beatrix .
the royal family has denied the allegations , making just one statement thus far - released shortly after the initial magazine interviews - stating that it was surprised by the accusations and did n't care to comment further because of " love for the princess . "

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .
as a result , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel after schröder had finished his roughly 90-minute talk and the members of his coalition had completed their standing ovation , the leader of the country 's biggest opposition party responded to the speech .
" that is surely not a major master plan for the federal republic of germany , " said angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the christian democratic union .
merkel said she doubted that schröder recognized the depths of germany 's problems and seemed to be focusing on " administering the moment . "
speech produces criticism disappointment about the speech spread through the unions and business community as well .
" we are bitterly disappointed , " said michael sommer , leader of the german trade union federation .
sommer said the disappointment applied particularly to the cuts in jobless benefits for older workers .
" that is a point that we can not and will not accept , " he said .
horst siebert , who heads the kiel institute for world economics , also expressed doubts about the labor reforms .
" there will be only a marginal improvement on the job market , " siebert said .
" furthermore , the chance of implementation is low . "
the chancellor had one other critic who had nothing to do with the political debate : the president of the german association of speech writers .
" the speech was dry and delivered with little emotion , " thilo von trotha said .
" that was nothing . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's jobless rate jumps again the number of germans thrown out of work in february climbed to 4.7 million .

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .
" immigration and integration are two sides of the same coin , " he said .
" that 's why they both have to be regulated .

royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen . no , it 's not the scandal prone british royals ' latest round of indiscretions .
nor is it another feud in monaco .
the gossip keeping the tongues of royal watchers wagging these days - allegations of secret bugging , a smear campaign , an illegitimate child - have centered on the usually teflon-coated dutch royal family , namely its matriarch queen beatrix . more than just fueling newspaper sales , the scandal has now drawn the attention of the dutch parliament , which convened a special hearing on tuesday to debate whether the queen was guilty of abusing her power .
the alleged victim of the queen 's wrongdoing , her niece , has demanded a public apology and filed a lawsuit against former prime minister wim kok . a drama played out in the headlines the saga began last month when princess margarita de bourbon de parme gave a series of interviews to the dutch magazine hp / de tijd .
one article , however , was not enough to contain this princess ' litany of accusations .
the magazine ran a special four-part series titled " orange bitters , " chronicling margarita 's misadventures in the house of orange .

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .
as a result , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel after schröder had finished his roughly 90-minute talk and the members of his coalition had completed their standing ovation , the leader of the country 's biggest opposition party responded to the speech .
" that is surely not a major master plan for the federal republic of germany , " said angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the christian democratic union .
merkel said she doubted that schröder recognized the depths of germany 's problems and seemed to be focusing on " administering the moment . "
speech produces criticism disappointment about the speech spread through the unions and business community as well .
" we are bitterly disappointed , " said michael sommer , leader of the german trade union federation .
sommer said the disappointment applied particularly to the cuts in jobless benefits for older workers .
" that is a point that we can not and will not accept , " he said .
horst siebert , who heads the kiel institute for world economics , also expressed doubts about the labor reforms .
" there will be only a marginal improvement on the job market , " siebert said .
" furthermore , the chance of implementation is low . "
the chancellor had one other critic who had nothing to do with the political debate : the president of the german association of speech writers .
" the speech was dry and delivered with little emotion , " thilo von trotha said .
" that was nothing . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's jobless rate jumps again the number of germans thrown out of work in february climbed to 4.7 million .

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .
" immigration and integration are two sides of the same coin , " he said .
" that 's why they both have to be regulated .

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .
as a result , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel after schröder had finished his roughly 90-minute talk and the members of his coalition had completed their standing ovation , the leader of the country 's biggest opposition party responded to the speech .

merkel said she doubted that schröder recognized the depths of germany 's problems and seemed to be focusing on " administering the moment . "
speech produces criticism disappointment about the speech spread through the unions and business community as well .
" we are bitterly disappointed , " said michael sommer , leader of the german trade union federation .
sommer said the disappointment applied particularly to the cuts in jobless benefits for older workers .
" that is a point that we can not and will not accept , " he said .
horst siebert , who heads the kiel institute for world economics , also expressed doubts about the labor reforms .
" there will be only a marginal improvement on the job market , " siebert said .
" furthermore , the chance of implementation is low . "

royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen . no , it 's not the scandal prone british royals ' latest round of indiscretions .
nor is it another feud in monaco .
the gossip keeping the tongues of royal watchers wagging these days - allegations of secret bugging , a smear campaign , an illegitimate child - have centered on the usually teflon-coated dutch royal family , namely its matriarch queen beatrix . more than just fueling newspaper sales , the scandal has now drawn the attention of the dutch parliament , which convened a special hearing on tuesday to debate whether the queen was guilty of abusing her power .
the alleged victim of the queen 's wrongdoing , her niece , has demanded a public apology and filed a lawsuit against former prime minister wim kok . a drama played out in the headlines the saga began last month when princess margarita de bourbon de parme gave a series of interviews to the dutch magazine hp / de tijd .
one article , however , was not enough to contain this princess ' litany of accusations .
the magazine ran a special four-part series titled " orange bitters , " chronicling margarita 's misadventures in the house of orange .
" i was loyal to my family my entire life , but the moment i expected support there was none , " she said . the articles were followed by a television interview , adding fuel to the fire and reminding many of princess diana 's historic appearance on the bbc at the height of her marital troubles with prince charles .
" they abuse power and that 's not right , " margarita said in the television interview . among princess margarita 's accusations are claims that the queen 's late father , prince bernhard , had a 20-year affair with his secretary and that her own father had an illegitimate child with a nanny .
but these nuggets of scandal were just bonus disclosures made by a chatty royal driven to talk by her own perceived suffering at the hands of a woman she paints as the queen of mean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess margarita and husband edwin de roy van zuydewijn margarita -lrb- photo -rrb- says beatrix ordered the dutch secret service to tap her home and private conversations with her husband , edwin de roy van zuydewijn , a commoner whom she married last year .
according to the princess , the queen was unhappy with her choice of husband and hoped to use the information to ruin his name and business , thereby prompting a split .
this information , she says , was shared with members of her family , including her father and brother . what 's more , princess margarita , daughter of the queen 's sister , princess irene -lrb- who gave up her claim to the throne to marry a spanish aristocrat -rrb- , says she was deliberately excluded from family events .
indeed , since the princess is fourth in line to the throne , her absences from the wedding of crown prince willem-alexander and the funeral of queen beatrix 's husband , prince klaus , last year were notable . the princess suspected that negative press reports were based on information illegally obtained by her own family and appealed to the country 's then prime minister , wim kok , for help before going to the press herself . seeking an explanation early on , the netherlands ' current prime minister , jan-peter balkenende , tried to put a damper on the story .
he appealed to the parties involved to work things out and put this episode behind them .
" it ca n't go on like this : the public offensive must stop , " balkenende said .
" it 's painful to watch , and it 's bad for the country 's image . " but margarita and her husband have not been so easily appeased and are willing to see this through .
" the queen must apologize to us publicly , " zuydewijn told the german magazine stern .
" we will not be satisfied with less . "
that and € 33.7 million -lrb- $ 36.3 million -rrb- in damages from the queen for ruining his reputation and business interests . on tuesday , they filed a lawsuit against kok , accusing him of fraud , forgery and the divulging of professional secrets . and though balkenende initially played down the allegations , he has since acknowledged that the information service looked into zuydewijn 's background at the queen 's request .
he claimed this is standard procedure for someone marrying into the royal family .
still , he conceded it was a mistake that the ministers in charge of the two departments involved - the justice and interior ministries - were not informed of the investigation .
he has since withdrawn the queen 's power to request an inquiry without his personal consent . nonetheless , dutch parliamentarians were not satisfied by balkenende 's explanation of the queen 's actions and called a special hearing on tuesday to discuss the matter . thom de graaf , a parliamentarian from the centrist d66 party , told the dutch newspaper het financieele dagblad that balkenende 's explanation was not enough .
the secret service could only investigate zuydewijn if he were a potential threat to the democratic rule of law , for which there was no evidence . others found it difficult to understand how certain details were leaked to the princess ' father and brother , yet the heads of the justice and interior ministries were not informed of these activities .
the algemeen dagblad , a dutch daily , said the current crisis could have " constitutional undertones " for the country . a first for the dutch for now at least , dutch royal watchers who may have found their own home-grown royals a bit of a snooze in the scandal department no longer have to look across the channel for fodder .
" it struck like a bombshell , " fred lammers , a biographer of beatrix and prince bernhard told the associated press .
" in britain , when servants leave the court the first thing they do is write a book .
here , nobody leaks anything . " this sign-of-the-times has likely not pleased queen beatrix .
the royal family has denied the allegations , making just one statement thus far - released shortly after the initial magazine interviews - stating that it was surprised by the accusations and did n't care to comment further because of " love for the princess . "
but many parliamentarians - and the princess - are hoping the queen will soon have more to say - by way of a reasonable explanation or public apology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live im focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .
as a result , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel after schröder had finished his roughly 90-minute talk and the members of his coalition had completed their standing ovation , the leader of the country 's biggest opposition party responded to the speech .

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .

" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .
as a result , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel after schröder had finished his roughly 90-minute talk and the members of his coalition had completed their standing ovation , the leader of the country 's biggest opposition party responded to the speech .

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .
as a result , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel after schröder had finished his roughly 90-minute talk and the members of his coalition had completed their standing ovation , the leader of the country 's biggest opposition party responded to the speech .
" that is surely not a major master plan for the federal republic of germany , " said angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the christian democratic union .
merkel said she doubted that schröder recognized the depths of germany 's problems and seemed to be focusing on " administering the moment . "
speech produces criticism disappointment about the speech spread through the unions and business community as well .
" we are bitterly disappointed , " said michael sommer , leader of the german trade union federation .
sommer said the disappointment applied particularly to the cuts in jobless benefits for older workers .
" that is a point that we can not and will not accept , " he said .
horst siebert , who heads the kiel institute for world economics , also expressed doubts about the labor reforms .
" there will be only a marginal improvement on the job market , " siebert said .
" furthermore , the chance of implementation is low . "
the chancellor had one other critic who had nothing to do with the political debate : the president of the german association of speech writers .
" the speech was dry and delivered with little emotion , " thilo von trotha said .
" that was nothing . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's jobless rate jumps again the number of germans thrown out of work in february climbed to 4.7 million .

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .

royal scandal , new to the netherlands , has become a matter for the dutch parliament , which is looking into allegations against the queen . no , it 's not the scandal prone british royals ' latest round of indiscretions .
nor is it another feud in monaco .
the gossip keeping the tongues of royal watchers wagging these days - allegations of secret bugging , a smear campaign , an illegitimate child - have centered on the usually teflon-coated dutch royal family , namely its matriarch queen beatrix . more than just fueling newspaper sales , the scandal has now drawn the attention of the dutch parliament , which convened a special hearing on tuesday to debate whether the queen was guilty of abusing her power .
the alleged victim of the queen 's wrongdoing , her niece , has demanded a public apology and filed a lawsuit against former prime minister wim kok . a drama played out in the headlines the saga began last month when princess margarita de bourbon de parme gave a series of interviews to the dutch magazine hp / de tijd .
one article , however , was not enough to contain this princess ' litany of accusations .
the magazine ran a special four-part series titled " orange bitters , " chronicling margarita 's misadventures in the house of orange .
" i was loyal to my family my entire life , but the moment i expected support there was none , " she said . the articles were followed by a television interview , adding fuel to the fire and reminding many of princess diana 's historic appearance on the bbc at the height of her marital troubles with prince charles .
" they abuse power and that 's not right , " margarita said in the television interview . among princess margarita 's accusations are claims that the queen 's late father , prince bernhard , had a 20-year affair with his secretary and that her own father had an illegitimate child with a nanny .
but these nuggets of scandal were just bonus disclosures made by a chatty royal driven to talk by her own perceived suffering at the hands of a woman she paints as the queen of mean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess margarita and husband edwin de roy van zuydewijn margarita -lrb- photo -rrb- says beatrix ordered the dutch secret service to tap her home and private conversations with her husband , edwin de roy van zuydewijn , a commoner whom she married last year .
according to the princess , the queen was unhappy with her choice of husband and hoped to use the information to ruin his name and business , thereby prompting a split .
this information , she says , was shared with members of her family , including her father and brother . what 's more , princess margarita , daughter of the queen 's sister , princess irene -lrb- who gave up her claim to the throne to marry a spanish aristocrat -rrb- , says she was deliberately excluded from family events .
indeed , since the princess is fourth in line to the throne , her absences from the wedding of crown prince willem-alexander and the funeral of queen beatrix 's husband , prince klaus , last year were notable . the princess suspected that negative press reports were based on information illegally obtained by her own family and appealed to the country 's then prime minister , wim kok , for help before going to the press herself . seeking an explanation early on , the netherlands ' current prime minister , jan-peter balkenende , tried to put a damper on the story .
he appealed to the parties involved to work things out and put this episode behind them .
" it ca n't go on like this : the public offensive must stop , " balkenende said .
" it 's painful to watch , and it 's bad for the country 's image . " but margarita and her husband have not been so easily appeased and are willing to see this through .
" the queen must apologize to us publicly , " zuydewijn told the german magazine stern .
" we will not be satisfied with less . "
that and € 33.7 million -lrb- $ 36.3 million -rrb- in damages from the queen for ruining his reputation and business interests . on tuesday , they filed a lawsuit against kok , accusing him of fraud , forgery and the divulging of professional secrets . and though balkenende initially played down the allegations , he has since acknowledged that the information service looked into zuydewijn 's background at the queen 's request .
he claimed this is standard procedure for someone marrying into the royal family .
still , he conceded it was a mistake that the ministers in charge of the two departments involved - the justice and interior ministries - were not informed of the investigation .
he has since withdrawn the queen 's power to request an inquiry without his personal consent . nonetheless , dutch parliamentarians were not satisfied by balkenende 's explanation of the queen 's actions and called a special hearing on tuesday to discuss the matter . thom de graaf , a parliamentarian from the centrist d66 party , told the dutch newspaper het financieele dagblad that balkenende 's explanation was not enough .
the secret service could only investigate zuydewijn if he were a potential threat to the democratic rule of law , for which there was no evidence . others found it difficult to understand how certain details were leaked to the princess ' father and brother , yet the heads of the justice and interior ministries were not informed of these activities .
the algemeen dagblad , a dutch daily , said the current crisis could have " constitutional undertones " for the country . a first for the dutch for now at least , dutch royal watchers who may have found their own home-grown royals a bit of a snooze in the scandal department no longer have to look across the channel for fodder .
" it struck like a bombshell , " fred lammers , a biographer of beatrix and prince bernhard told the associated press .
" in britain , when servants leave the court the first thing they do is write a book .
here , nobody leaks anything . " this sign-of-the-times has likely not pleased queen beatrix .
the royal family has denied the allegations , making just one statement thus far - released shortly after the initial magazine interviews - stating that it was surprised by the accusations and did n't care to comment further because of " love for the princess . "
but many parliamentarians - and the princess - are hoping the queen will soon have more to say - by way of a reasonable explanation or public apology . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

" i was loyal to my family my entire life , but the moment i expected support there was none , " she said . the articles were followed by a television interview , adding fuel to the fire and reminding many of princess diana 's historic appearance on the bbc at the height of her marital troubles with prince charles .
" they abuse power and that 's not right , " margarita said in the television interview . among princess margarita 's accusations are claims that the queen 's late father , prince bernhard , had a 20-year affair with his secretary and that her own father had an illegitimate child with a nanny .
but these nuggets of scandal were just bonus disclosures made by a chatty royal driven to talk by her own perceived suffering at the hands of a woman she paints as the queen of mean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess margarita and husband edwin de roy van zuydewijn margarita -lrb- photo -rrb- says beatrix ordered the dutch secret service to tap her home and private conversations with her husband , edwin de roy van zuydewijn , a commoner whom she married last year .
according to the princess , the queen was unhappy with her choice of husband and hoped to use the information to ruin his name and business , thereby prompting a split .
this information , she says , was shared with members of her family , including her father and brother . what 's more , princess margarita , daughter of the queen 's sister , princess irene -lrb- who gave up her claim to the throne to marry a spanish aristocrat -rrb- , says she was deliberately excluded from family events .
indeed , since the princess is fourth in line to the throne , her absences from the wedding of crown prince willem-alexander and the funeral of queen beatrix 's husband , prince klaus , last year were notable . the princess suspected that negative press reports were based on information illegally obtained by her own family and appealed to the country 's then prime minister , wim kok , for help before going to the press herself . seeking an explanation early on , the netherlands ' current prime minister , jan-peter balkenende , tried to put a damper on the story .
he appealed to the parties involved to work things out and put this episode behind them .
" it ca n't go on like this : the public offensive must stop , " balkenende said .
" it 's painful to watch , and it 's bad for the country 's image . " but margarita and her husband have not been so easily appeased and are willing to see this through .
" the queen must apologize to us publicly , " zuydewijn told the german magazine stern .
" we will not be satisfied with less . "
that and € 33.7 million -lrb- $ 36.3 million -rrb- in damages from the queen for ruining his reputation and business interests . on tuesday , they filed a lawsuit against kok , accusing him of fraud , forgery and the divulging of professional secrets . and though balkenende initially played down the allegations , he has since acknowledged that the information service looked into zuydewijn 's background at the queen 's request .
he claimed this is standard procedure for someone marrying into the royal family .
still , he conceded it was a mistake that the ministers in charge of the two departments involved - the justice and interior ministries - were not informed of the investigation .
he has since withdrawn the queen 's power to request an inquiry without his personal consent . nonetheless , dutch parliamentarians were not satisfied by balkenende 's explanation of the queen 's actions and called a special hearing on tuesday to discuss the matter . thom de graaf , a parliamentarian from the centrist d66 party , told the dutch newspaper het financieele dagblad that balkenende 's explanation was not enough .
the secret service could only investigate zuydewijn if he were a potential threat to the democratic rule of law , for which there was no evidence . others found it difficult to understand how certain details were leaked to the princess ' father and brother , yet the heads of the justice and interior ministries were not informed of these activities .
the algemeen dagblad , a dutch daily , said the current crisis could have " constitutional undertones " for the country . a first for the dutch for now at least , dutch royal watchers who may have found their own home-grown royals a bit of a snooze in the scandal department no longer have to look across the channel for fodder .
" it struck like a bombshell , " fred lammers , a biographer of beatrix and prince bernhard told the associated press .
" in britain , when servants leave the court the first thing they do is write a book .
here , nobody leaks anything . " this sign-of-the-times has likely not pleased queen beatrix .
the royal family has denied the allegations , making just one statement thus far - released shortly after the initial magazine interviews - stating that it was surprised by the accusations and did n't care to comment further because of " love for the princess . "

the alleged victim of the queen 's wrongdoing , her niece , has demanded a public apology and filed a lawsuit against former prime minister wim kok . a drama played out in the headlines the saga began last month when princess margarita de bourbon de parme gave a series of interviews to the dutch magazine hp / de tijd .
one article , however , was not enough to contain this princess ' litany of accusations .
the magazine ran a special four-part series titled " orange bitters , " chronicling margarita 's misadventures in the house of orange .
" i was loyal to my family my entire life , but the moment i expected support there was none , " she said . the articles were followed by a television interview , adding fuel to the fire and reminding many of princess diana 's historic appearance on the bbc at the height of her marital troubles with prince charles .
" they abuse power and that 's not right , " margarita said in the television interview . among princess margarita 's accusations are claims that the queen 's late father , prince bernhard , had a 20-year affair with his secretary and that her own father had an illegitimate child with a nanny .
but these nuggets of scandal were just bonus disclosures made by a chatty royal driven to talk by her own perceived suffering at the hands of a woman she paints as the queen of mean . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess margarita and husband edwin de roy van zuydewijn margarita -lrb- photo -rrb- says beatrix ordered the dutch secret service to tap her home and private conversations with her husband , edwin de roy van zuydewijn , a commoner whom she married last year .
according to the princess , the queen was unhappy with her choice of husband and hoped to use the information to ruin his name and business , thereby prompting a split .
this information , she says , was shared with members of her family , including her father and brother . what 's more , princess margarita , daughter of the queen 's sister , princess irene -lrb- who gave up her claim to the throne to marry a spanish aristocrat -rrb- , says she was deliberately excluded from family events .
indeed , since the princess is fourth in line to the throne , her absences from the wedding of crown prince willem-alexander and the funeral of queen beatrix 's husband , prince klaus , last year were notable . the princess suspected that negative press reports were based on information illegally obtained by her own family and appealed to the country 's then prime minister , wim kok , for help before going to the press herself . seeking an explanation early on , the netherlands ' current prime minister , jan-peter balkenende , tried to put a damper on the story .
he appealed to the parties involved to work things out and put this episode behind them .
" it ca n't go on like this : the public offensive must stop , " balkenende said .
" it 's painful to watch , and it 's bad for the country 's image . " but margarita and her husband have not been so easily appeased and are willing to see this through .

he claimed this is standard procedure for someone marrying into the royal family .
still , he conceded it was a mistake that the ministers in charge of the two departments involved - the justice and interior ministries - were not informed of the investigation .

the secret service could only investigate zuydewijn if he were a potential threat to the democratic rule of law , for which there was no evidence . others found it difficult to understand how certain details were leaked to the princess ' father and brother , yet the heads of the justice and interior ministries were not informed of these activities .

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .
" immigration and integration are two sides of the same coin , " he said .
" that 's why they both have to be regulated .

the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .
" immigration and integration are two sides of the same coin , " he said .

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .
as a result , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel after schröder had finished his roughly 90-minute talk and the members of his coalition had completed their standing ovation , the leader of the country 's biggest opposition party responded to the speech .
" that is surely not a major master plan for the federal republic of germany , " said angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the christian democratic union .
merkel said she doubted that schröder recognized the depths of germany 's problems and seemed to be focusing on " administering the moment . "
speech produces criticism disappointment about the speech spread through the unions and business community as well .
" we are bitterly disappointed , " said michael sommer , leader of the german trade union federation .
sommer said the disappointment applied particularly to the cuts in jobless benefits for older workers .
" that is a point that we can not and will not accept , " he said .
horst siebert , who heads the kiel institute for world economics , also expressed doubts about the labor reforms .
" there will be only a marginal improvement on the job market , " siebert said .
" furthermore , the chance of implementation is low . "
the chancellor had one other critic who had nothing to do with the political debate : the president of the german association of speech writers .

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .

but the opposition to them is unchanged , too . three months after germany 's constitutional court overturned the country 's first-ever immigration law , chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition government has launched a second attempt to push it through unchanged .
however , interior minister otto schily says he is not confident the conservative opposition will allow the bill to pass this time . " you are not willing to compromise at all , " he told them on thursday . the christian democratic party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , wants a fundamental rewrite of the bill before it is prepared to drop its objections . vote on draft law ruled " unconstitutional " germany 's first-ever law to regulate immigration was due to take effect on jan 1 , 2003 .
but a month before , the country 's constitutional court in karlsruhe overturned it on a point of procedure . after being passed by the german parliament , the bundestag , the bill had to go onto the second legislative chamber , the bundesrat , for ratification .
the bundesrat , which represents the country 's state governments on national issues , is dominated by the opposition . when the vote was taken , brandenburg - which is run by a coalition of christian and social democrats - cast a split vote , with labor minister alwin ziel -lrb- spd -rrb- voting in favor of the bill and cdu interior minister jörg schönbohm voting against . one state , one vote under the german constitution , states must cast a unanimous vote .
berlin 's spd mayor , klaus wowereit , therefore turned to brandenburg 's premier , manfred stolpe , for a decision .
stolpe voted for the draft law , so wowereit ruled that brandenburg had supported the proposal .
but the conservatives refused to accept the ruling and walked out of the session . a month later , german president , johannes rau signed the bill into law .
however , he made it clear he expected the constitutional court to rule on its legality .
in july , the opposition states in the bundesrat petitioned the court to do that .
although schily argued that brandenburg 's delegation was headed by its state premier and that he was the person who should cast the vote , the court disagreed and ruled against the decision at the end of last year .
a month later , the cabinet decided to submit the draft law again , without alteration . a demographic imperative for years , demographers have been warning that germany 's rapidly aging population and falling birth rates could at some time in the future trigger a major crisis in the country 's overstretched pension and welfare systems .
in fact , some experts argue that germany , which already has about 7 million foreigners living there , will need to accept over a quarter of a million more each year for the next 20 years just to maintain its present population and the stability of its social system .
the bill was introduced in an attempt to create a framework to regulate those levels of immigration .
it would simplify residency permit regulations , cutting the current five down to two .
in addition , it would introduce a range of measures - including compulsory language and citizenship courses - to help foreigners integrate into german society . the bill also addresses the concerns of industry and business leaders , who warn that the german economy is in desperate need of highly qualified and skilled workers .
it would make it easier for foreign students educated at german universities to stay on , and easier for self-employed foreigners to work .
the bill also includes provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad . the draft law implicitly accepts that immigration is a practical necessity .
however , at a time when unemployment is climbing toward the 5 million mark , many germans inevitably fear being swamped by foreign labor .
the opposition has repeatedly voiced and even exploited this fear , saying that the law should limit and channel immigration . no more compromises however , schily stressed on thursday that he had already watered down his proposals on a number of points to get the opposition 's agreement .
" the whole draft law as it stands now is a compromise , " he said . he also rejected a cdu / csu proposal to limit the scope of any immigration law to measures solely designed to promote the integration of foreigners .
" immigration and integration are two sides of the same coin , " he said .
" that 's why they both have to be regulated .

the address was met with disappointment . the speaker stepped before his berlin audience bearing a speech filled with hellfire and brimstone .
" what is wrong with our country ? "
german president roman herzog asked the audience in 1997 .
" in clear terms : a loss of economic dynamism .
the ossification of our society .
an unbelievable mental depression . "
nearly six years later , it was german chancellor gerhard schröder 's turn to point the way out of the crisis that only seems to have gotten worse since herzog delivered his sermon : today , the country 's economy is on the brink of a recession , unemployment is rapidly approaching the record levels of 4.8 million set in 1998 , and costs in the country 's health care system continue to climb unchecked .
" we have to summon up the courage to launch the changes that are necessary to return our country to the top of europe in economic and social performance , " schröder told the country 's parliament in a speech that was called one of the most important in his political career .
time for sacrifice , chancellor says in place of hellfire and brimstone , the social democrat preached sacrifice .
" all segments of society will have to make a contribution : employers and employees , freelancers and retirees , " he said .
one area of sacrifice will focus on the unemployed , schröder said .
all jobless people younger than 55 will be able to draw unemployment benefits for a maximum of 12 months instead of 32 months , he said .
those 55 and older will be eligible for 18 months .
" i reject the notion that people who want to work and can work have to draw welfare , while others who are not even looking for a job draw unemployment assistance , " he said .
in the nearly 90-minute speech , the chancellor also listed a string of other reforms he wants to introduce , from changes in rules governing layoffs to revisions in the health insurance system and to assistance for germany 's financially struggling cities .
revision to layoff rules proposed the issue of layoff rules is one of the most pressing ones for employers , who maintain that the current rules serve as a barrier to job creation .
as part of his program , the chancellor proposed the creation of new rules for companies to follow when they have to lay off employees .
currently , companies have to weigh such factors a worker 's age and seniority in drawing up a list of employees whom they must dismiss .
but the chancellor proposed on friday that company and worker representatives be allowed to create a system that allows the best employees to keep their jobs .
turning to the health insurance system , the chancellor said his goal was to cut premiums .
today , the average premium is 14.3 percent of gross pay , and is generally shared on a 50-50 basis between employers and employees .
the chancellor wants to reduce that premium to 13 percent .
one way he wants to lighten the load carried by the insurers is to require people to take out private insurance if they want to receive funds to help them with long-term injury and illness .
today , the public insurance companies begin paying this assistance at the start of the seventh week that a person has been out of work . the change is designed to save the insurers € 7 billion -lrb- $ 7.56 billion -rrb- . schröder promised that the health insurance changes would be balanced .
" we stand by one principle : everyone will receive the medical care he needs , regardless of age and income . "
the task as schröder acknowledged will be difficult .
the deficit of germany 's public health insurance companies climbed nearly 6 percent last year to $ 2.96 billion , and about one-third of the country 's public health funds increased their premiums this year .
cities to get assistance to germany 's cities , schröder promised help instead of sacrifice .
he said he would create a program of low interest loans to help them and the country 's troubled construction industry .
the city program would total € 7 billion and would be used for capital investment projects .
the builders ' program would total € 8 billion and would be used for apartment renovation .
germany 's cities are suffering in part because the total amount of revenues that flow from the their primary source of revenue - the trade tax that applies to businesses - has decreased by € 3.8 billion -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- since 2000 and the costs of such social services as welfare have been climbing .
as a result , the total deficit of german cities hit € 6.65 billion last year and may rise to a record € 9.9 billion this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel after schröder had finished his roughly 90-minute talk and the members of his coalition had completed their standing ovation , the leader of the country 's biggest opposition party responded to the speech .

the survey , in september 2002 , found litter levels were slightly above the previous year 's , and more than half as great again as in 1994 .
it found one piece of litter for every 60 centimetres -lrb- 24 inches -rrb- of beach inspected .
but it recorded the lowest levels of sewage-related debris ever found .
the survey was completed by 2,598 volunteers for the marine conservation society -lrb- mcs -rrb- .
they searched 229 beaches , stretching for 150 km -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- , on 21 and 22 september 2002 .
the volunteers found 241,285 separate pieces of litter , 2.1 % more than in 2001 .
but litter from sewage made up only 3.9 % of the total , compared with 6.7 % in 2001 .
ubiquitous bags the 10 commonest items found represented 61 % of all litter collected , and included categories such as plastic drinks bottles , cigarette stubs , crisp and sweet wrappers , and glass pieces .
mcs says plastics were again the material found most often , accounting for at least 57 % of the total .
finds included 36 plastic bags for every kilometre of coastline surveyed and mcs wants the government to introduce a plastic bag tax .
alison conway of mcs said : " the amount of litter collected in 2002 shows a 2.1 % increase on 2001 levels .
" although that 's only a slight increase , litter levels are over 50 % higher than those recorded in 1994 , indicating there is still a long way to go to ensure our beaches are clean and safe places for people and wildlife .
expensive habit " litter poses a threat to dolphins , whales , turtles and seabirds by entanglement in and ingestion of plastics .
" it also spoils fish catches , and affects local economies through clean-up costs and loss of tourism in affected areas . "
a dead minke whale found on a beach in normandy , in france , in april 2002 had 800 grammes -lrb- 1.7 pounds -rrb- of plastics in its stomach .
they included two english supermarket bags and a british plastic and foil potato crisp wrapper .
the survey found the highest proportion of litter was left by beach visitors -lrb- 39.1 % -rrb- , followed by fishing litter -lrb- 14.6 % -rrb- , sewage-related debris -lrb- 3.9 % -rrb- , and shipping -lrb- 2.2 % -rrb- .
long-lived hazards seb clover , the youngest person to make a solo atlantic crossing , said : " when i set off in december 2002 , the first few miles of my trip were fraught with danger - not from the usual hazards that one always expects at sea - but from fridges and all sorts of other floating rubbish which surrounded tenerife .
" even in mid-ocean you see lots of rubbish just floating about .
plastics float around for years without degrading and you see lumps of polystyrene regularly .
" much of it ends up on beaches the world over .
it is about time we stopped treating our world so badly - it 's the only one we 've got . "

alison conway of mcs said : " the amount of litter collected in 2002 shows a 2.1 % increase on 2001 levels .

plastic litter helped to kill a whale " it also spoils fish catches , and affects local economies through clean-up costs and loss of tourism in affected areas . "
a dead minke whale found on a beach in normandy , in france , in april 2002 had 800 grammes -lrb- 1.7 pounds -rrb- of plastics in its stomach .
they included two english supermarket bags and a british plastic and foil potato crisp wrapper .
the survey found the highest proportion of litter was left by beach visitors -lrb- 39.1 % -rrb- , followed by fishing litter -lrb- 14.6 % -rrb- , sewage-related debris -lrb- 3.9 % -rrb- , and shipping -lrb- 2.2 % -rrb- .

south hams is aiming to save £ 30,000 over the next two years by pulling out of cleaning 13 privately-owned beaches .
they include beauty spots such as bantham , thurlestone , challaborough and wembury .
tony eden , from south hams council , said the decision to end beach cleaning was about allocating the council 's responsibilities properly .
we shall be making provision with the owners to make sure that the quality of the beaches is maintained south hams council he said : " it is unfair for south hams council tax payers to pay for cleaning private beaches .
" the council will continue to clean beaches it has responsibility for . "
south hams has 12 blue flag beaches , awarded to those that meet high standards of quality and cleanliness , and the council says that the move will not affect standards .
a spokeswoman said : " we have one of the highest number of blue flags in the country and we shall be making provision with the owners to make sure that the quality of the beaches is maintained . "
the move came as south west beaches were condemned in a report as the dirtiest in england .
the marine conservation society -lrb- mcs -rrb- , which surveyed beaches around the uk last year , found a total of 51,416 items on 31 beaches in the south west .
wildlife threat an average of 3,955 items per kilometre were found , significantly higher than the national average of 1,609 items / km and 85 % higher than in 2001 .
the mcs said the rise in the density of litter found on south west beaches was " astonishing " .
alison conway , mcs litter projects co-ordinator , said : " this shows there is still a long way to go to ensure our beaches are clean and safe places for people and wildlife .
" litter poses a threat to dolphins , whales , turtles and seabirds by entanglement in and ingestion of plastics .
" it also spoils fish catches and affects local economies through clean-up costs and loss of tourism in affected areas . "

lemon balm , a shrub that resembles a small nettle , improved " secondary memory " in tested volunteers according to two academics at northumbria university .
in the laboratory it also had a biochemical effect known to be important to memory .
dr andrew scholey and dr david kennedy , based in newcastle , made capsules of dried lemon balm and gave them to a group of 20 volunteers .
their memory was then tested one , three , and six hours later .
the findings , presented on thursday at the british psychological society 's annual conference in bournemouth , showed no effect on working memory - the constant recall of continual events during the day .
' ability to learn ' dr scholey said : " it did affect secondary memory , which is where a memory is stored , lost from consciousness , and then retrieved again .
" the ability to learn , store and retrieve information was improved . "
lemon balm improved the mood of the volunteers by enhancing calmness .
in the laboratory , lemon balm increased the activity of acetylcholene , an important chemical messenger linked to memory that is reduced in people with alzheimer 's disease .
dr scholey said it was too early to say whether lemon balm might help alzheimer 's sufferers , but said : " it may help conditions where the memory is fragile . "
he said in the 16th century the herbalist john gerard gave lemon balm to students to " quicken the senses " .

officers have always said the case is still open , and carried out extensive searches of the river avon several times since 1996 .
in 1998 a news conference was convened , and a fresh appeal for information launched by miss hall 's family .
detectives have also looked at possible links with other cases , including that of estate agent suzy lamplugh and the " batman rapist " , a serial sex attacker in bath who has evaded capture for years .
two arrests miss hall 's parents are in their 50s and live in bradford-on-avon , eight miles from bath .
in a short statement to the media , they said on wednesday : " it is far too early to know whether this will finally lead to the truth about what happened to our daughter .

two men were arrested in connection with miss hall 's disappearance on wednesday .
