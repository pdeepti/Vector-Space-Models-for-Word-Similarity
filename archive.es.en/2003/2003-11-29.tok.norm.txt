germany , france and britain have agreed on a eu defense plan that will see the bloc create an autonomous military headquarters in brussels and strengthen its established strategic planning units . after the first day of tense discussions at the meeting of european union foreign ministers in naples on friday , germany , france and britain agreed on a plan which will reinforce the eu ’ s military capabilities and create an autonomous eu military headquarters in brussels while not undermining nato or infuriating the united states . the agreement , the laboriously-negotiated conclusion to talks on the sidelines of the eu draft constitution meeting , was eventually confirmed late in the evening in an announcement by french foreign minister , dominique de villepin after british officials had insisted on informing washington before going public . the united states has been highly critical of plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg to launch a separate eu military planning cell , which it believed would compromise the role of nato and cause unnecessary and confusing duplication of operations .
things were made worse last month when germany leaked details of discussions suggesting that british prime minister tony blair was seeking to mend fences in europe by conceding on the european defense proposals . planning cell set for mons while remaining firmly aligned with the thoughts of washington at the time of tensions over the eu plans , britain has now agreed with france and germany that the bloc will set up its planning cell at shape , nato ’ s military headquarters near mons in belgium .
from there , eu military planners would , with the alliance 's backing , draw on nato assets - notably transport planes , satellite intelligence and the alliance 's communications network - for peacekeeping missions . british officials , however , diluted this section of the agreement in a separately released statement shortly after the formal announcement had been made , insisting that the cortenberg option would only have a skeleton staff and be used only if national headquarters in britain , france and germany were unavailable . brussels hq to be strengthened the agreement also sees the strengthening of the eu ’ s operational strategic planning unit at cortenberg in brussels from where , in time , independent european military operations similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping operation in the congo this year could be coordinated . the “ big three ” have also agreed that " structured cooperation " in defence can go ahead .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .

the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .
lindbergh was an american national icon , named by time magazine as one of the 20 most inspiring figures of the 20th century , despite the fact he was widely known to have been an admirer of adolf hitler 's germany .
admiration for hitler 's germany in his biography , berg notes that as late as april 1939 - after germany overtook czechoslovakia - lindbergh was willing to " make excuses " for the nazi dictator .
" much as i disapprove of many things hitler had done , " lindbergh wrote in his diary of april 2 , 1939 , " i believe -lsb- germany -rsb- has pursued the only consistent policy in europe in recent years .
i can not support her broken promises , but she has only moved a little faster than other nations ... in breaking promises .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .
lindbergh was an american national icon , named by time magazine as one of the 20 most inspiring figures of the 20th century , despite the fact he was widely known to have been an admirer of adolf hitler 's germany .

germany , france and britain have agreed on a eu defense plan that will see the bloc create an autonomous military headquarters in brussels and strengthen its established strategic planning units . after the first day of tense discussions at the meeting of european union foreign ministers in naples on friday , germany , france and britain agreed on a plan which will reinforce the eu ’ s military capabilities and create an autonomous eu military headquarters in brussels while not undermining nato or infuriating the united states . the agreement , the laboriously-negotiated conclusion to talks on the sidelines of the eu draft constitution meeting , was eventually confirmed late in the evening in an announcement by french foreign minister , dominique de villepin after british officials had insisted on informing washington before going public . the united states has been highly critical of plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg to launch a separate eu military planning cell , which it believed would compromise the role of nato and cause unnecessary and confusing duplication of operations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.11.2003 tests prove claim of lindbergh ’ s second family großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lindbergh 's flying exploits won him many hearts and , it seems , one in particular in germany .
charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .
lindbergh was an american national icon , named by time magazine as one of the 20 most inspiring figures of the 20th century , despite the fact he was widely known to have been an admirer of adolf hitler 's germany .
admiration for hitler 's germany in his biography , berg notes that as late as april 1939 - after germany overtook czechoslovakia - lindbergh was willing to " make excuses " for the nazi dictator .
" much as i disapprove of many things hitler had done , " lindbergh wrote in his diary of april 2 , 1939 , " i believe -lsb- germany -rsb- has pursued the only consistent policy in europe in recent years .
i can not support her broken promises , but she has only moved a little faster than other nations ... in breaking promises .
the question of right and wrong is one thing by law and another thing by history .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .
lindbergh was an american national icon , named by time magazine as one of the 20 most inspiring figures of the 20th century , despite the fact he was widely known to have been an admirer of adolf hitler 's germany .
admiration for hitler 's germany in his biography , berg notes that as late as april 1939 - after germany overtook czechoslovakia - lindbergh was willing to " make excuses " for the nazi dictator .
" much as i disapprove of many things hitler had done , " lindbergh wrote in his diary of april 2 , 1939 , " i believe -lsb- germany -rsb- has pursued the only consistent policy in europe in recent years .
i can not support her broken promises , but she has only moved a little faster than other nations ... in breaking promises .

germany , france and britain have agreed on a eu defense plan that will see the bloc create an autonomous military headquarters in brussels and strengthen its established strategic planning units . after the first day of tense discussions at the meeting of european union foreign ministers in naples on friday , germany , france and britain agreed on a plan which will reinforce the eu ’ s military capabilities and create an autonomous eu military headquarters in brussels while not undermining nato or infuriating the united states . the agreement , the laboriously-negotiated conclusion to talks on the sidelines of the eu draft constitution meeting , was eventually confirmed late in the evening in an announcement by french foreign minister , dominique de villepin after british officials had insisted on informing washington before going public . the united states has been highly critical of plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg to launch a separate eu military planning cell , which it believed would compromise the role of nato and cause unnecessary and confusing duplication of operations .

germany , france and britain have agreed on a eu defense plan that will see the bloc create an autonomous military headquarters in brussels and strengthen its established strategic planning units . after the first day of tense discussions at the meeting of european union foreign ministers in naples on friday , germany , france and britain agreed on a plan which will reinforce the eu ’ s military capabilities and create an autonomous eu military headquarters in brussels while not undermining nato or infuriating the united states . the agreement , the laboriously-negotiated conclusion to talks on the sidelines of the eu draft constitution meeting , was eventually confirmed late in the evening in an announcement by french foreign minister , dominique de villepin after british officials had insisted on informing washington before going public . the united states has been highly critical of plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg to launch a separate eu military planning cell , which it believed would compromise the role of nato and cause unnecessary and confusing duplication of operations .
things were made worse last month when germany leaked details of discussions suggesting that british prime minister tony blair was seeking to mend fences in europe by conceding on the european defense proposals . planning cell set for mons while remaining firmly aligned with the thoughts of washington at the time of tensions over the eu plans , britain has now agreed with france and germany that the bloc will set up its planning cell at shape , nato ’ s military headquarters near mons in belgium .
from there , eu military planners would , with the alliance 's backing , draw on nato assets - notably transport planes , satellite intelligence and the alliance 's communications network - for peacekeeping missions . british officials , however , diluted this section of the agreement in a separately released statement shortly after the formal announcement had been made , insisting that the cortenberg option would only have a skeleton staff and be used only if national headquarters in britain , france and germany were unavailable . brussels hq to be strengthened the agreement also sees the strengthening of the eu ’ s operational strategic planning unit at cortenberg in brussels from where , in time , independent european military operations similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping operation in the congo this year could be coordinated . the “ big three ” have also agreed that " structured cooperation " in defence can go ahead .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .
lindbergh was an american national icon , named by time magazine as one of the 20 most inspiring figures of the 20th century , despite the fact he was widely known to have been an admirer of adolf hitler 's germany .
admiration for hitler 's germany in his biography , berg notes that as late as april 1939 - after germany overtook czechoslovakia - lindbergh was willing to " make excuses " for the nazi dictator .
" much as i disapprove of many things hitler had done , " lindbergh wrote in his diary of april 2 , 1939 , " i believe -lsb- germany -rsb- has pursued the only consistent policy in europe in recent years .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .

germany , france and britain have agreed on a eu defense plan that will see the bloc create an autonomous military headquarters in brussels and strengthen its established strategic planning units . after the first day of tense discussions at the meeting of european union foreign ministers in naples on friday , germany , france and britain agreed on a plan which will reinforce the eu ’ s military capabilities and create an autonomous eu military headquarters in brussels while not undermining nato or infuriating the united states . the agreement , the laboriously-negotiated conclusion to talks on the sidelines of the eu draft constitution meeting , was eventually confirmed late in the evening in an announcement by french foreign minister , dominique de villepin after british officials had insisted on informing washington before going public . the united states has been highly critical of plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg to launch a separate eu military planning cell , which it believed would compromise the role of nato and cause unnecessary and confusing duplication of operations .

from there , eu military planners would , with the alliance 's backing , draw on nato assets - notably transport planes , satellite intelligence and the alliance 's communications network - for peacekeeping missions . british officials , however , diluted this section of the agreement in a separately released statement shortly after the formal announcement had been made , insisting that the cortenberg option would only have a skeleton staff and be used only if national headquarters in britain , france and germany were unavailable . brussels hq to be strengthened the agreement also sees the strengthening of the eu ’ s operational strategic planning unit at cortenberg in brussels from where , in time , independent european military operations similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping operation in the congo this year could be coordinated . the “ big three ” have also agreed that " structured cooperation " in defence can go ahead .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .
lindbergh was an american national icon , named by time magazine as one of the 20 most inspiring figures of the 20th century , despite the fact he was widely known to have been an admirer of adolf hitler 's germany .
admiration for hitler 's germany in his biography , berg notes that as late as april 1939 - after germany overtook czechoslovakia - lindbergh was willing to " make excuses " for the nazi dictator .
" much as i disapprove of many things hitler had done , " lindbergh wrote in his diary of april 2 , 1939 , " i believe -lsb- germany -rsb- has pursued the only consistent policy in europe in recent years .
i can not support her broken promises , but she has only moved a little faster than other nations ... in breaking promises .
the question of right and wrong is one thing by law and another thing by history .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .

germany , france and britain have agreed on a eu defense plan that will see the bloc create an autonomous military headquarters in brussels and strengthen its established strategic planning units . after the first day of tense discussions at the meeting of european union foreign ministers in naples on friday , germany , france and britain agreed on a plan which will reinforce the eu ’ s military capabilities and create an autonomous eu military headquarters in brussels while not undermining nato or infuriating the united states . the agreement , the laboriously-negotiated conclusion to talks on the sidelines of the eu draft constitution meeting , was eventually confirmed late in the evening in an announcement by french foreign minister , dominique de villepin after british officials had insisted on informing washington before going public . the united states has been highly critical of plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg to launch a separate eu military planning cell , which it believed would compromise the role of nato and cause unnecessary and confusing duplication of operations .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .

they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .

germany , france and britain have agreed on a eu defense plan that will see the bloc create an autonomous military headquarters in brussels and strengthen its established strategic planning units . after the first day of tense discussions at the meeting of european union foreign ministers in naples on friday , germany , france and britain agreed on a plan which will reinforce the eu ’ s military capabilities and create an autonomous eu military headquarters in brussels while not undermining nato or infuriating the united states . the agreement , the laboriously-negotiated conclusion to talks on the sidelines of the eu draft constitution meeting , was eventually confirmed late in the evening in an announcement by french foreign minister , dominique de villepin after british officials had insisted on informing washington before going public . the united states has been highly critical of plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg to launch a separate eu military planning cell , which it believed would compromise the role of nato and cause unnecessary and confusing duplication of operations .
things were made worse last month when germany leaked details of discussions suggesting that british prime minister tony blair was seeking to mend fences in europe by conceding on the european defense proposals . planning cell set for mons while remaining firmly aligned with the thoughts of washington at the time of tensions over the eu plans , britain has now agreed with france and germany that the bloc will set up its planning cell at shape , nato ’ s military headquarters near mons in belgium .
from there , eu military planners would , with the alliance 's backing , draw on nato assets - notably transport planes , satellite intelligence and the alliance 's communications network - for peacekeeping missions . british officials , however , diluted this section of the agreement in a separately released statement shortly after the formal announcement had been made , insisting that the cortenberg option would only have a skeleton staff and be used only if national headquarters in britain , france and germany were unavailable . brussels hq to be strengthened the agreement also sees the strengthening of the eu ’ s operational strategic planning unit at cortenberg in brussels from where , in time , independent european military operations similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping operation in the congo this year could be coordinated . the “ big three ” have also agreed that " structured cooperation " in defence can go ahead .
this will allow certain countries , which meet certain military criteria , within the eu to be included in military planning and operations . constitution woes continue the eu foreign ministers will continue discussing the fine tuning of the draft european union constitution over the weekend with italian officials , representing the current eu presidency , hoping to have a document agreed on by sunday .

from there , eu military planners would , with the alliance 's backing , draw on nato assets - notably transport planes , satellite intelligence and the alliance 's communications network - for peacekeeping missions . british officials , however , diluted this section of the agreement in a separately released statement shortly after the formal announcement had been made , insisting that the cortenberg option would only have a skeleton staff and be used only if national headquarters in britain , france and germany were unavailable . brussels hq to be strengthened the agreement also sees the strengthening of the eu ’ s operational strategic planning unit at cortenberg in brussels from where , in time , independent european military operations similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping operation in the congo this year could be coordinated . the “ big three ” have also agreed that " structured cooperation " in defence can go ahead .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .
lindbergh was an american national icon , named by time magazine as one of the 20 most inspiring figures of the 20th century , despite the fact he was widely known to have been an admirer of adolf hitler 's germany .
admiration for hitler 's germany in his biography , berg notes that as late as april 1939 - after germany overtook czechoslovakia - lindbergh was willing to " make excuses " for the nazi dictator .
" much as i disapprove of many things hitler had done , " lindbergh wrote in his diary of april 2 , 1939 , " i believe -lsb- germany -rsb- has pursued the only consistent policy in europe in recent years .
i can not support her broken promises , but she has only moved a little faster than other nations ... in breaking promises .
the question of right and wrong is one thing by law and another thing by history .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .
lindbergh was an american national icon , named by time magazine as one of the 20 most inspiring figures of the 20th century , despite the fact he was widely known to have been an admirer of adolf hitler 's germany .
admiration for hitler 's germany in his biography , berg notes that as late as april 1939 - after germany overtook czechoslovakia - lindbergh was willing to " make excuses " for the nazi dictator .
" much as i disapprove of many things hitler had done , " lindbergh wrote in his diary of april 2 , 1939 , " i believe -lsb- germany -rsb- has pursued the only consistent policy in europe in recent years .

germany , france and britain have agreed on a eu defense plan that will see the bloc create an autonomous military headquarters in brussels and strengthen its established strategic planning units . after the first day of tense discussions at the meeting of european union foreign ministers in naples on friday , germany , france and britain agreed on a plan which will reinforce the eu ’ s military capabilities and create an autonomous eu military headquarters in brussels while not undermining nato or infuriating the united states . the agreement , the laboriously-negotiated conclusion to talks on the sidelines of the eu draft constitution meeting , was eventually confirmed late in the evening in an announcement by french foreign minister , dominique de villepin after british officials had insisted on informing washington before going public . the united states has been highly critical of plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg to launch a separate eu military planning cell , which it believed would compromise the role of nato and cause unnecessary and confusing duplication of operations .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .
lindbergh was an american national icon , named by time magazine as one of the 20 most inspiring figures of the 20th century , despite the fact he was widely known to have been an admirer of adolf hitler 's germany .
admiration for hitler 's germany in his biography , berg notes that as late as april 1939 - after germany overtook czechoslovakia - lindbergh was willing to " make excuses " for the nazi dictator .

germany , france and britain have agreed on a eu defense plan that will see the bloc create an autonomous military headquarters in brussels and strengthen its established strategic planning units . after the first day of tense discussions at the meeting of european union foreign ministers in naples on friday , germany , france and britain agreed on a plan which will reinforce the eu ’ s military capabilities and create an autonomous eu military headquarters in brussels while not undermining nato or infuriating the united states . the agreement , the laboriously-negotiated conclusion to talks on the sidelines of the eu draft constitution meeting , was eventually confirmed late in the evening in an announcement by french foreign minister , dominique de villepin after british officials had insisted on informing washington before going public . the united states has been highly critical of plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg to launch a separate eu military planning cell , which it believed would compromise the role of nato and cause unnecessary and confusing duplication of operations .
things were made worse last month when germany leaked details of discussions suggesting that british prime minister tony blair was seeking to mend fences in europe by conceding on the european defense proposals . planning cell set for mons while remaining firmly aligned with the thoughts of washington at the time of tensions over the eu plans , britain has now agreed with france and germany that the bloc will set up its planning cell at shape , nato ’ s military headquarters near mons in belgium .
from there , eu military planners would , with the alliance 's backing , draw on nato assets - notably transport planes , satellite intelligence and the alliance 's communications network - for peacekeeping missions . british officials , however , diluted this section of the agreement in a separately released statement shortly after the formal announcement had been made , insisting that the cortenberg option would only have a skeleton staff and be used only if national headquarters in britain , france and germany were unavailable . brussels hq to be strengthened the agreement also sees the strengthening of the eu ’ s operational strategic planning unit at cortenberg in brussels from where , in time , independent european military operations similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping operation in the congo this year could be coordinated . the “ big three ” have also agreed that " structured cooperation " in defence can go ahead .

the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .
lindbergh was an american national icon , named by time magazine as one of the 20 most inspiring figures of the 20th century , despite the fact he was widely known to have been an admirer of adolf hitler 's germany .
admiration for hitler 's germany in his biography , berg notes that as late as april 1939 - after germany overtook czechoslovakia - lindbergh was willing to " make excuses " for the nazi dictator .
" much as i disapprove of many things hitler had done , " lindbergh wrote in his diary of april 2 , 1939 , " i believe -lsb- germany -rsb- has pursued the only consistent policy in europe in recent years .

germany , france and britain have agreed on a eu defense plan that will see the bloc create an autonomous military headquarters in brussels and strengthen its established strategic planning units . after the first day of tense discussions at the meeting of european union foreign ministers in naples on friday , germany , france and britain agreed on a plan which will reinforce the eu ’ s military capabilities and create an autonomous eu military headquarters in brussels while not undermining nato or infuriating the united states . the agreement , the laboriously-negotiated conclusion to talks on the sidelines of the eu draft constitution meeting , was eventually confirmed late in the evening in an announcement by french foreign minister , dominique de villepin after british officials had insisted on informing washington before going public . the united states has been highly critical of plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg to launch a separate eu military planning cell , which it believed would compromise the role of nato and cause unnecessary and confusing duplication of operations .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .

germany , france and britain have agreed on a eu defense plan that will see the bloc create an autonomous military headquarters in brussels and strengthen its established strategic planning units . after the first day of tense discussions at the meeting of european union foreign ministers in naples on friday , germany , france and britain agreed on a plan which will reinforce the eu ’ s military capabilities and create an autonomous eu military headquarters in brussels while not undermining nato or infuriating the united states . the agreement , the laboriously-negotiated conclusion to talks on the sidelines of the eu draft constitution meeting , was eventually confirmed late in the evening in an announcement by french foreign minister , dominique de villepin after british officials had insisted on informing washington before going public . the united states has been highly critical of plans put forward by germany , france , belgium and luxembourg to launch a separate eu military planning cell , which it believed would compromise the role of nato and cause unnecessary and confusing duplication of operations .

things were made worse last month when germany leaked details of discussions suggesting that british prime minister tony blair was seeking to mend fences in europe by conceding on the european defense proposals . planning cell set for mons while remaining firmly aligned with the thoughts of washington at the time of tensions over the eu plans , britain has now agreed with france and germany that the bloc will set up its planning cell at shape , nato ’ s military headquarters near mons in belgium .
from there , eu military planners would , with the alliance 's backing , draw on nato assets - notably transport planes , satellite intelligence and the alliance 's communications network - for peacekeeping missions . british officials , however , diluted this section of the agreement in a separately released statement shortly after the formal announcement had been made , insisting that the cortenberg option would only have a skeleton staff and be used only if national headquarters in britain , france and germany were unavailable . brussels hq to be strengthened the agreement also sees the strengthening of the eu ’ s operational strategic planning unit at cortenberg in brussels from where , in time , independent european military operations similar to the french-led eu peacekeeping operation in the congo this year could be coordinated . the “ big three ” have also agreed that " structured cooperation " in defence can go ahead .
this will allow certain countries , which meet certain military criteria , within the eu to be included in military planning and operations . constitution woes continue the eu foreign ministers will continue discussing the fine tuning of the draft european union constitution over the weekend with italian officials , representing the current eu presidency , hoping to have a document agreed on by sunday .

charles lindbergh , the first man to fly non-stop from new york to paris , has been confirmed by dna testing as the father of three german siblings who claimed the flying ace had a 17-year affair with their mother . dna tests have proved that charles lindbergh , the american aviation hero who won the hearts of millions around the world for his non-stop solo flight from new york to paris in 1927 , fathered three children in germany unbeknown to his wife back in the united states .
the tests were carried out after astrid bouteuil discovered more than 100 letters in the attic of her mother 's house in ammersee , upper bavaria which hinted at the identity of the father she and her two brothers , dyrk and david hesshaimer , had only known by the pseudonym careu kent and through the frequent visits he made to germany in the 1960s while they were growing up .
letters hinted at identity bouteuil told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in august that the letters , mostly handwritten , were signed with " c " and referred to " our children . "
the three hesshaimer children were born between 1958 and 1967 and each have " father unknown " on their birth certificates .
the german paper said it contracted an independent analysis , lindbergh 's biographer , a. scott berg , who indicated that the letters came from lindbergh . berg told the new york times in august that he believed the letters could be genuine because of the dates , contents and lindbergh 's prolific correspondence .
" i could easily see that these are charles lindbergh 's letters , " berg said at the time but insisted that the letters did not prove lindbergh had an affair .
" is it chronologically and geographically possible ?
yes , " he said in the interview .
" does it sound true to his character ?
no . "
u.s. relatives informed now it seems that the tests from the munich-based lmu institute have confirmed that lindbergh was the father of a secret german family .
lawyer anton schwenk , representing the hesshaimer family , released a statement saying that lindbergh ’ s family in the united states had been informed of the test results .
lindbergh married anne morrow lindbergh in 1929 , and they had six children .
although the german siblings intend to publish a book on their mother brigitte hesshaimer 's 17-year relationship with one of the 20th-century 's best-known figures and a television documentary on the siblings ' revelation will be aired in germany next year , they have no plans to stake claim as legal heirs , according to a report issued by the associated press .
involved until death the hesshaimer children claim that the man who was to become their father met their mother in munich in 1957 when he was 55 and she was 31 .
they claim the relationship lasted until his death in 1974 .
lindbergh was an american national icon , named by time magazine as one of the 20 most inspiring figures of the 20th century , despite the fact he was widely known to have been an admirer of adolf hitler 's germany .
admiration for hitler 's germany in his biography , berg notes that as late as april 1939 - after germany overtook czechoslovakia - lindbergh was willing to " make excuses " for the nazi dictator .
" much as i disapprove of many things hitler had done , " lindbergh wrote in his diary of april 2 , 1939 , " i believe -lsb- germany -rsb- has pursued the only consistent policy in europe in recent years .
i can not support her broken promises , but she has only moved a little faster than other nations ... in breaking promises .

officials at the japanese space programme said the rocket had to be destroyed after take-off because of an unspecified technical failure .
it was impossible to save the satellites , the officials added .
an investigation is underway .
the original launch had been scheduled for september , but was postponed three times because of technical problems .
" shortly after the launch , we sent a destroy order to the rocket as we concluded that the mission can not fulfil the purpose , " said spokesperson shoko yamamoto .
" we can not tell further details , but at least we can say this mission ended in failure . "
japan already has two satellites monitoring north korea , which is suspected of developing nuclear weapons .
wake-up call the bbc 's jonathan head in tokyo says the incident is an embarrassing setback for japan , just weeks after china - a technologically less advanced country - put a man into space .
our correspondent says the japanese are bound to try again to launch spy satellites .
north korea has denounced the deployment of the first two satellites as a " hostile act " that could trigger a renewed arms race .
the satellite project was intended predominantly as a response to north korea 's firing of a ballistic missile over japan into the pacific in august 1998 .
until then japan bought commercial satellite photos from the us and france .
the launch came at a sensitive time for japan and north korea as the two countries prepared to sit down at six-way talks to resolve the crisis over pyongyang 's nuclear ambitions .
some 400 police were around the launch site on the southern island of tanegashima .
coast guard ships were patrolling waters to thwart possible terrorist attacks or a possible attempt by north korea to disrupt the launch .

mr chen was giving his first public reaction to a controversial referendum law which was passed on thursday .
mr chen said it made such polls acceptable to the taiwanese people , including those opposed to reform .
correspondents say the suggestion is sure to infuriate china , which regards taiwan as a renegade province .
taiwan 's parliament approved the legislation on thursday , but in a form that was substantially weaker than the government 's original draft .
an opposition coalition pushed through a clause that blocks referendums on the most sensitive subjects , including changing taiwan 's name or flag .
but mr chen said the passing of the legislation meant that the concept of the referendum had been made acceptable to the taiwanese people , including " anti-democracy , anti-reform forces " .
he said he was not satisfied with the opposition amendments , without specifying whether he would attempt to revise or repeal the bill .
chinese concern president chen has made referendums a key issue in his campaign for re-election next march .
he said the new law would make it possible to hold a referendum at the same time as the presidential election on march 20 , to safeguard taiwan 's sovereignty and security .
china has responded to taiwan 's passing of the referendum bill , saying it raises " grave concerns " .
in the past , referendum was a taboo , now it 's a bill stage is set for presidential race however , the statement from china 's taiwan affairs office suggested relief that the bill was passed in a watered-down version .
china has threatened to act if taiwan makes any moves towards independence .
the bbc 's louisa lim , reporting from beijing , says china 's worst-case scenario has not been realised .
beijing had feared that if a mechanism for referendums was established , it could be used to force a vote on independence .
' irresponsible ' the china daily newspaper praised " rational " forces in taiwan for weakening the bill , but the paper also cautioned that the vote " handed a time bomb to some separatist forces " .
the opposition placed heavy restrictions on the new law the move was " extremely irresponsible " , the paper quoted wang kebin , secretary-general of the china council for the promotion of peaceful national reunification , as saying .
mps in taipei had considered several different versions of the referendum bill .
the version that was passed , written by the opposition which has a parliamentary majority , gives the legislature the power to screen potential referendum issues that might involve changes to the constitution .
the opposition was also successful in passing an article that said only the public and parliament could initiate a referendum .
president chen had wanted the government to have the same power to call such a vote .
opinion polls suggest that the majority of taiwanese people prefer the ambiguous status quo of their island .
the bbc 's chris hogg says the referendum issue used to be a taboo subject in taiwanese politics .
fears that it would provoke china to use force stifled serious debate .
but , he says , politicians on all sides seem to have decided they can now use it to drum up support ahead of presidential elections next march .

but , even though a seasoned hack with a knack of getting what he wants out of politicians , he found it surprisingly difficult to pin down the man at the centre of the media circus .
strangely enough , on a day dedicated to talking , the most difficult thing of all was to get the prime minister to do just that .
it was billed as the launch of the " big conversation " initiative - mr blair 's big idea to re-engage with the public and to give them a chance to have their say in formulating policy ahead of the next general election .
it just so happened that the big talk-in was kicking off in newport .
an ideal opportunity for the welsh media , myself included , to talk to the prime minister - or so you 'd think !
organising " jaw-jaw " with mr blair , however , ai n't that simple .
he was talking to just about everyone except us .
there was just one window of opportunity in a frenetic day and that was at ringland labour club in newport .
we were ordered to set up our cameras and his chair in front of the those who had been assembled to talk to him and the home secretary about anti-social behaviour .
there was not much room for negotiation , so we did what we were told .
the prime ministerial human caravan , trailed by london 's finest snappers , swept in for the pre-arranged photo opportunity .
it was late - so late , in fact , that we were told there was no time to talk to us after all .
we protested .
we talked and we talked and we talked .
those accompanying the prime minister seemed to be listening , but were they hearing only what they wanted to hear ?
could we engage with them in a way they were encouraging the public to engage with the party ?
if the prime minister was in wales to start a national conversation , would n't it appear rather odd not to converse with the local media , we asked .
seasoned advisers recognise blackmail when they hear it , but they tolerated us and pointed us to another " window " later in the day .
just when we 'd settled on another interview area at another location everyone began talking to us at the same time .
was this what they meant by " the big conversation " ?
no .
this was to be a very limited conversation .
we were told the prime minister refused to sit down .
there was no time for that .
he would stand , thank you very much !
health assurances you begin to wonder whether the prime minister ever sits down .
he is perpetual motion .
no wonder there is so much concern about his health which prompted my first question - whilst standing : " how are you prime minister ? "
difficult question that , but he brushed it aside with assurances that he was fit and well .
next question : " given that you 're in listening mode , are you listening to your doctor ? "
the reply was a fixed grin .
time to move on and ask easier questions -about top-up fees and the richard commission on welsh assembly powers .
was mr blair prepared to be flexible in his response if the messages he received were hostile ?
on university tuition fees , mr blair said he was listening to those opposing his plans , but also to those who were saying the institutions needed more money , and that money could not just be found from general taxation .
on the richard commission , mr blair said he would wait and see whether it recommended more powers .
of course he would listen , but there were no guarantees what the response would be .
and that was it .
another interview - standing - and he was off at a pace which had those following him struggling to keep up .
this was a prime minister with no reverse gear , determined to advance in a fast-changing , dangerous world .
health scares had not diminished his resolve .
mr blair , though , knows that the trick is to take the people with him .
that is what this consultation exercise is all about .
and it seems that , if you persevere , you do - eventually - get to talk to him .

generations of kids have had variations on the basic premise of play-acting conflict .
these have ranged from cowboys and indians , to cops and robbers , allies and nazis , and - for the star wars generation - rebels and imperial forces .
today , however , the world seems obsessed with terrorism .
president bush wages his so-called war on terror , while nations who disagree with the " american way " fight with their own desperate means .
given this prevailing climate , it makes me wonder whether today 's children play terrorists and counter-terrorists ?
striking out it is certainly a theme that has established itself in video gaming . "
living in a world where terrorism is regularly front page news , using it as a theme for a cultural product - a book , a film , a game - is the acceptable norm , despite any doubts " counter-strike , the 2000 mod of pc classic half-life , became the most successful online multiplayer game ever .
although the transition of a pc game to a console inevitably involves some " dumbing down " , the arrival of counter-strike on the xbox is very welcome .
arguably , it provides better live multiplayer gaming opportunities than rainbow six 3 , a game similarly concerned with terrorism .
no story-based solo mode has been bolted on to the basic formula for the xbox release .
this is very much a game that has to be played live or with system link .
teams can play either as terrorists , planting bombs or holding hostages , or counter-terrorists , attempting to defuse the bomb or rescue the hostages .
terror as culture ?
i am writing this as newspaper front pages report the latest tragedy , the deaths of 27 people in istanbul .
furthermore , as part of the promotion of the game , i spent an excellent day doing special forces training with an ex-sas chap .
vague questions of morality flit through my head , but they are amorphous .
living in a world where terrorism is regularly front page news , using it as a theme for a cultural product - a book , a film , a game - is the acceptable norm , despite any doubts .
the bottom line with counter-strike is that it is a game and a good one at that .
rather than inculcating violence , playing it on xbox live actually encourages socialisation , which can not be bad for starters .

it is more acceptable to fight terror in games generations of kids have had variations on the basic premise of play-acting conflict .
these have ranged from cowboys and indians , to cops and robbers , allies and nazis , and - for the star wars generation - rebels and imperial forces .
today , however , the world seems obsessed with terrorism .
president bush wages his so-called war on terror , while nations who disagree with the " american way " fight with their own desperate means .
given this prevailing climate , it makes me wonder whether today 's children play terrorists and counter-terrorists ?

although the transition of a pc game to a console inevitably involves some " dumbing down " , the arrival of counter-strike on the xbox is very welcome .

vague questions of morality flit through my head , but they are amorphous .
living in a world where terrorism is regularly front page news , using it as a theme for a cultural product - a book , a film , a game - is the acceptable norm , despite any doubts .
the bottom line with counter-strike is that it is a game and a good one at that .

it is more acceptable to fight terror in games generations of kids have had variations on the basic premise of play-acting conflict .
these have ranged from cowboys and indians , to cops and robbers , allies and nazis , and - for the star wars generation - rebels and imperial forces .
today , however , the world seems obsessed with terrorism .
president bush wages his so-called war on terror , while nations who disagree with the " american way " fight with their own desperate means .
given this prevailing climate , it makes me wonder whether today 's children play terrorists and counter-terrorists ?
striking out it is certainly a theme that has established itself in video gaming .
living in a world where terrorism is regularly front page news , using it as a theme for a cultural product - a book , a film , a game - is the acceptable norm , despite any doubts discuss this story on bbci collective counter-strike , the 2000 mod of pc classic half-life , became the most successful online multiplayer game ever .
although the transition of a pc game to a console inevitably involves some " dumbing down " , the arrival of counter-strike on the xbox is very welcome .
arguably , it provides better live multiplayer gaming opportunities than rainbow six 3 , a game similarly concerned with terrorism .
no story-based solo mode has been bolted on to the basic formula for the xbox release .
this is very much a game that has to be played live or with system link .
teams can play either as terrorists , planting bombs or holding hostages , or counter-terrorists , attempting to defuse the bomb or rescue the hostages .
terror as culture ?
i am writing this as newspaper front pages report the latest tragedy , the deaths of 27 people in istanbul .
furthermore , as part of the promotion of the game , i spent an excellent day doing special forces training with an ex-sas chap .
vague questions of morality flit through my head , but they are amorphous .

international power is now offering creditors of the plant 95p in the pound , revising a previous offer of 71p as drax works to restructure its £ 1.3bn debt .
the generating company won the battle to take a stake in the power station in august this year , having seen off bids from investment organisations and a mining company .
the improved bid has been made on the hopes of larger profits as a result of increasing electricity prices .
drax has been trying to restructure its finances since last year , when it was pitched into financial crisis by the collapse of txu europe , its biggest customer .
aes , the american utility that owned drax , effectively abandoned the plant at the beginning of august after banks refused to accept its financial restructuring offer .

press reports on saturday said american billionaire malcolm glazer had bought 4.5 % of united 's shares for £ 30m to increase his holding to 15 % .
investment bank commerzbank confirmed it had brokered a deal , but did not say who bought the shares - or how many .
takeover rumours have surrounded united for months .
news of the share deal pushed united 's share price up on friday , and they closed 14 pence ahead at 262 pence .
the guardian newspaper reported that manchester united 's chief executive david gill had held secret talks with mr glazer , who owns tampa bay buccaneers american football team , to establish his intentions towards the club .
mr glazer is said to have told him only that he saw the stake he already owned as a good investment .
a look at who could be preparing to take over man united at-a-glance under city rules , the buyer of the new stake has until tuesday to reveal their identity to the club and the market .
a report in the guardian said the london head of germany 's commerzbank , mehmet dalman , was brokering the deal .
however , it said it was not clear whether mr dalman was buying the shares for himself , on behalf of the german bank , or whether he was acting for existing investors in the club .
a number of wealthy businessmen , who already own stakes in the club , have been linked with a possible takeover offer .
the irish racehorse magnates , jp mcmanus and john magnier , raised their stake to 23 % in october , when they bought bskyb 's 10 % share of the club .
however , the two have said they do not intend to launch a takeover bid for the club .
american football magnate mr glazer has steadily increased his stake in united .
dutch television entrepreneur john de mol , another shareholder in the club , has also been mentioned as a possible suitor .
but talpa capital - mr de mol 's investment vehicle which owns 4.3 % of united - said it was not behind friday 's share deal .

stephen gough , 44 , from eastleigh , hampshire , was given a three month prison sentence on friday , but was released because of the time he had already spent in custody .
gough restarted his walk on saturday morning from cromarty bridge in ross-shire , where he had been arrested at the beginning of october .
he braved lashing rain , wind and low temperatures to get back on the road but was picked up by the police after he had walked about three miles .
police received a 999 call from a resident who had spotted gough walking on drummond road in evanton , easter ross .
he is expected to appear in court on monday .
breach of the peace gough set off in june from land 's end for the 847-mile walk to john o 'groats in the far north of scotland .
he was arrested on numerous occasions but was allowed to continue on his way until he reached the scottish highlands .
gough , who had been kept in custody since 6 october , was sentenced to three months in prison at inverness sheriff court on friday after being found guilty of a charge of breach of the peace .
however , he was released because of the length of time he had been held .
during the hearing gough 's solicitor , craig wood , said his client was determined to continue his quest .
this is how they treat a human being .
shame , shame .
stephen gough " he has engaged in this type of behaviour in order to raise public awareness of the human state and celebrate himself as a human being , " he told the court .
" he has no perception of any wrongdoing . "
sheriff alexander pollock said he could see no alternative to a custodial sentence .
the sentence was backdated to 6 october , when he was taken into custody after trying to cross the cromarty bridge naked , shortly after being released from court at dingwall .
gough was released shortly after the ruling because of the time he has been held in custody .
as mr gough was led away from court , he shouted angrily at reporters : " this is how they treat a human being .

although they do not yet have to act under the international climate treaty , she says , they are wasting no time .
she says the treaty itself , the kyoto protocol , which has not yet become part of international law , is " a peanut - but a vital one in the long run " .
and she believes its signatories are committed to making it work whether or not the treaty is eventually ratified .
the official is ms joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the un climate change convention .
the countries which have signed the convention are meeting in the italian city of milan from 1 to 12 december " to assess progress in addressing climate change " .
staying away the protocol will enter into force only when 55 signatories have ratified it : they must include industrialised countries responsible for 55 % of the developed world 's carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions in 1990 .
some critics say president bush 's decision that the us , which emits more greenhouse gases than any other country , will not ratify the protocol condemns it to irrelevance .
we shall have to find ways of making the principle of equity a reality , or it will be very hard to get the poorer countries involved joke waller-hunter but enough other signatories have done so for it to enter into force if and when russia , another big polluter , ratifies .
so far president putin has not said it will ratify .
ms waller-hunter told bbc news online at the convention 's offices in the german city of bonn : " there are 119 countries which have ratified the protocol , and i get the impression they are committed to implementing it regardless of it entering into force .
" in the developing countries , known in the protocol as non-annex one countries , we 're seeing a keen interest in kyoto .
" countries like india , china and cuba are all waiting for the protocol 's clean development mechanism to start working - that will let richer countries invest in projects to cut greenhouse gases in the developing world .
" the rapidly industrialising countries see their environmental and economic interests coinciding .
china is really decoupling energy use from gdp . "
only a start the protocol aims to reduce emissions of six gases scientists say are helping to change the climate .
if it is implemented , industrialised countries ' emissions will by some time between 2008 and 2012 be cut to 5.2 % below their 1990 levels .
but many scientists say cuts of around 60-70 % will be needed by mid-century to avoid runaway climate change .
ms waller-hunter said : " it 's wrong to think the protocol will do so little that it 's insignificant .
" it 's a very important first step that can lead to much more far-reaching measures .
yes , it 's a peanut - but a vital one in the long run . "
at the moment only the industrialised -lrb- annex one -rrb- countries have to cut their emissions , but within a few years these cuts will be obligatory for every country .
backsliding begun ms waller-hunter said : " we have to look at a future of increasing carbon constraints .
and we shall have to find ways of making the principle of equity a reality , or it will be very hard to get the poorer countries involved .
" the overall aim of stabilising emissions has been met , but mainly because of cuts by countries in transition , -lsb- the former members of the soviet union -rsb- .
the uk and germany have performed well , but not all their european partners - spain 's emissions have risen by 46 % " .
the milan meeting , much of which is highly technical , will also receive a report on emission trends and projections .
whatever voluntary efforts the poorer countries are making , this shows the combined emissions of europe , japan , the us and other highly industrialised countries could grow by 8 % between 2000 and 2010 .
this would take them to 17 % above their 1990 levels , in stark contrast with the rich countries ' kyoto commitment to achieve significant cuts .
