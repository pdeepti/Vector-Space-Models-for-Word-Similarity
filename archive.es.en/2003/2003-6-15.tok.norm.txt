amid speculation the u.s. might drastically reduce its troops and their families based in germany , the mayors of 13 german cities that host american bases traveled to washington to plead the personnel be allowed to stay . the u.s. state department is currently reviewing the future of its many u.s. military bases around the world .
in the next few months , it is expected to announce major changes , which could include major cuts to the 70,000 u.s. troops and their families based in germany .
according to a report in the wall street journal , the pentagon wants to pull out 75 percent of u.s. troops from germany over the next few years .
many are to be deployed to countries like poland , hungary or romania , without their families , for six month rotational posts .
the pentagon argues the move will save much money and also allow the forces to be much closer to where they ’ re needed .
german mayors : troop withdrawal will be disastrous but the decision is proving to be a nightmare for the mayors of 13 german cities and towns , which host large american bases .
they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .
that ’ s worth sixty jobs over 20 years .
these kind of things really add up , and will be a major upheaval if the troops pack up and leave , " he told deutsche welle .
u.s. troops well-integrated into german society to make their point , the 13 traveled to washington this week to personally explain to the pentagon , the u.s. state department and even congress that germany is a safe and pleasant home for u.s. troops .
helmut wächter , the mayor of grafenwöhr in bavaria , told deutsche welle he returned feeling somewhat better than when he left .
" our message came across in all of our discussions .
some of those who spoke on our behalf are also based in germany , and through their own experiences , know about , and understand , the special relationships that are formed .
and of course , they will try to convey this message so that washington can take these issues into consideration . "
mayor wächter ’ s sentiments were confirmed by u.s. brigadier-general erwin lessel based in kaiserlautern which is home to 40,000 u.s. troops and their families .
brigadier-general lessel said the troops liked it there and added many of them have become close friends with their german neighbours .
reduction of forces still unclear mayor deubig of kaiserslautern said he expects u.s. forces will be asked to leave germany , but doubts that the figure of 75 percent is accurate .
" that figure has not been confirmed .
but it ’ s been made clear that the discussion is focussed on a reduction of large numbers of u.s. troops . "
the cuts could be interpreted as a rebuke to germany ’ s anti-war stance .
but experts note that the pentagon can ’ t shrink size of its forces in europe too much without risking its status within nato – the north atlantic treaty organization .
the final numbers are expected to be announced in a few months – troop withdrawal could follow as soon as one year later . wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the green party , german chancellor schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , has given solid support to the chancellor ’ s controversial package of social and economic reforms at a special party conference . chancellor schröder ’ s bold attempts to overhaul germany ’ s overburdened social security system and rigid labor market found further acceptance on sunday with green party voting overwhelmingly in favor of his reform course .
at the end of a two-day special party conference in cottbus , more than 90 percent of the 700 delegates threw their weight behind the controversial reform package known as " agenda 2010 " unveiled by the chancellor in march this year .
the move follows a similar show of support by the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- earlier this month .
the reform package , which has drawn ire from both left-wingers and traditionalists in the spd and greens in recent months , includes capping the amount and duration of unemployment benefits , melding unemployment benefits and welfare benefits into one monthly check , streamlining the health care system and making it easier for german employers to hire and fire people .
" a new perspective for red-green " the green party leadership urged party delegates during the conference to back the much-needed reforms , which are needed to shake germany out of its economic slump and tackle unemployment , and warned that a failure to do so could threaten the coexistence of the spd-green government .
party head reinhard bütikofer said it was a core concern of the greens not to leave a heavily indebted nation to the next generation and that reforming the generous social system was a matter of survival for the coalition .
" " if red-green manage to get a grip on the reforms , then we can even change the mood in the country , " bütikofer said in a reference to the general pessimistic outlook in germany on account of a near-stagnant economy .
the green party ’ s most prominent member and germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer characterized the reform vote as an acid test for green beliefs and principles .
" it ’ s a question of whether we manage to carry through the reforms on our own , instead of leaving it to the right of center parties , " he said .
fischer emphasized the implementation of reforms wasn ’ t just meant for the country , but also to give " a new perspective to red-green . "
critics say reform package socially unfair but despite broad support for the reformist agenda within the greens , several critics within the party have once again voiced fears the reform plans are socially unfair and aren ’ t suitable for solving pressing problems plaguing the country .
green economics expert werner schulz lambasted the chancellor ’ s plans , saying it didn ’ t solve the structural problems , but " rather burdened the weak in a one-sided way with reform costs . "
several left-wingers also criticized " agenda 2010 " as socially unbalanced and a betrayal of basic party principles .
in particular the chancellor ’ s health care reforms which include charging more to patients for prescription drugs in an effort to control spiraling costs have come in for much flak .
in addition , a left-wing base is also renewing its demand for the implementation of the wealth tax , which foresees levying a one percent tax on more prosperous companies and individuals , and managed to push it through with a majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor 's party gives hearty support to reform course chancellor gerhard schröder received stronger-than-awaited backing from his party for a radical reform package that experts say is needed to shake germany out of its economic slump .

martin kippenberger and candida höfer are germany 's representatives at the venice biennale , one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions which opens on sunday in the lagoon city . german curator julian heynen calls the exhibit in the german pavilion at this year 's venice biennale " topography . "
many an art critic has been inclined to scratch his head in confusion over the selection of two vastly different artists for this year 's german showing at the biennale - martin kippenberger who died in 1997 and was a controversial figure in the art world during his lifetime and the cool and severe candida höfer . like the biennale which opens for the 50th time on sunday , martin kippenberger would have been 50 this year too .
he always wanted to be invited to the venice biennale .
again and again the conceptual artist stressed that the only things that would make him go to the city of lagoons were the biennale and his own honeymoon . in the end the controversial artist made it for both occasions , but only the honeymoon took place during his lifetime , just a year before his death in 1997 .
it was an off year , when the exhibition was n't taking place .
kippenberger had himself photographed in front of the empty german pavilion for his " biennale venezia 1996 " poster . now visitors to the biennale can look forward to kippenberger 's phantasmal global underground metro-net project , conceived a few years before his death , to offer 20 seconds of relief from sizzling venetian summer temperatures above 40 c -lrb- 104 f -rrb- .
a subway grate has been installed in the floor of the german pavilion and every five minutes the sound of a train passing and a burst of cool air emanates from it .
kippenberger 's plan was to link the whole world with subway entrances , exits and ventilation grates that led nowhere .
he installed his first entrance in syros , greece in 1993 and planted additional evidence in dawson city , canada and münster , germany . empty rooms in sharp contrast to kippenberger 's virtual subway network , photographer candida höfer focuses on bleak pictures of public rooms devoid of any human presence . " the idea to combine our works appealed to me and i like what came of it , " photographer höfer , told the news agency dpa . born in eberswalde in 1944 , höfer is one of the most important representatives of the bernd and hilla becher school , a german couple , who have had a vast influence on documentary photography and passed on their unique style to scores of students at the düsseldorf art academy . for the biennale , heynen and höfer selected around two dozen photographs of rooms devoid of people , concert halls , libraries , cafés , sport halls and waiting rooms . " i think that because the people are n't visible they are much more recognizable .
you see that the rooms are made for people .
even when you do n't see them , they are there , " höfer told the kölner stadt-anzeiger , her local newspaper at home in cologne . but kippenberger and höfer are not the only german artists in venice .
theater director and perhaps germany 's most famous provocateur christoph schlingensief has positioned seven people " without jobs , homes or religions " as motionless pillars at the entrance to the giardini , where the country pavilions are .
their t-shirts say " church of fear . "
there they are meant to demonstrate their fears , the berlin director has said . art critics doubt though that this year 's german contribution will receive the attention that it did last time around , in 2001 .
then gregor schneider had rooms from his childhood house in rheydt , germany - from the bathroom sink to the electrical wires - moved to venice and installed in the pavilion , which was built in 1938 .

with the permission of the museum , they filmed the more than 3,000-year-old bust mounted on the body in late may to show later at the exhibition in venice . museum director dietrich wildung was subsequently accused of desecrating nefertiti by egyptian officials , who have demanded the sculpture be returned to cairo .
" nefertiti is not in safe hands in berlin , " sahi hawas , the head of the egyptian antiquities department , told the press on june 8 .
hawas and egyptian culture minister faruk husni also took offense to the sculpture 's near nakedness . wildung dismissed the calls for nefertiti 's return .

amid speculation the u.s. might drastically reduce its troops and their families based in germany , the mayors of 13 german cities that host american bases traveled to washington to plead the personnel be allowed to stay . the u.s. state department is currently reviewing the future of its many u.s. military bases around the world .
in the next few months , it is expected to announce major changes , which could include major cuts to the 70,000 u.s. troops and their families based in germany .
according to a report in the wall street journal , the pentagon wants to pull out 75 percent of u.s. troops from germany over the next few years .
many are to be deployed to countries like poland , hungary or romania , without their families , for six month rotational posts .
the pentagon argues the move will save much money and also allow the forces to be much closer to where they ’ re needed .
german mayors : troop withdrawal will be disastrous but the decision is proving to be a nightmare for the mayors of 13 german cities and towns , which host large american bases .
they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .
that ’ s worth sixty jobs over 20 years .
these kind of things really add up , and will be a major upheaval if the troops pack up and leave , " he told deutsche welle .
u.s. troops well-integrated into german society to make their point , the 13 traveled to washington this week to personally explain to the pentagon , the u.s. state department and even congress that germany is a safe and pleasant home for u.s. troops .
helmut wächter , the mayor of grafenwöhr in bavaria , told deutsche welle he returned feeling somewhat better than when he left .
" our message came across in all of our discussions .
some of those who spoke on our behalf are also based in germany , and through their own experiences , know about , and understand , the special relationships that are formed .
and of course , they will try to convey this message so that washington can take these issues into consideration . "
mayor wächter ’ s sentiments were confirmed by u.s. brigadier-general erwin lessel based in kaiserlautern which is home to 40,000 u.s. troops and their families .
brigadier-general lessel said the troops liked it there and added many of them have become close friends with their german neighbours .
reduction of forces still unclear mayor deubig of kaiserslautern said he expects u.s. forces will be asked to leave germany , but doubts that the figure of 75 percent is accurate .
" that figure has not been confirmed .
but it ’ s been made clear that the discussion is focussed on a reduction of large numbers of u.s. troops . "
the cuts could be interpreted as a rebuke to germany ’ s anti-war stance .
but experts note that the pentagon can ’ t shrink size of its forces in europe too much without risking its status within nato – the north atlantic treaty organization .
the final numbers are expected to be announced in a few months – troop withdrawal could follow as soon as one year later . wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

martin kippenberger and candida höfer are germany 's representatives at the venice biennale , one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions which opens on sunday in the lagoon city . german curator julian heynen calls the exhibit in the german pavilion at this year 's venice biennale " topography . "
many an art critic has been inclined to scratch his head in confusion over the selection of two vastly different artists for this year 's german showing at the biennale - martin kippenberger who died in 1997 and was a controversial figure in the art world during his lifetime and the cool and severe candida höfer . like the biennale which opens for the 50th time on sunday , martin kippenberger would have been 50 this year too .
he always wanted to be invited to the venice biennale .
again and again the conceptual artist stressed that the only things that would make him go to the city of lagoons were the biennale and his own honeymoon . in the end the controversial artist made it for both occasions , but only the honeymoon took place during his lifetime , just a year before his death in 1997 .
it was an off year , when the exhibition was n't taking place .
kippenberger had himself photographed in front of the empty german pavilion for his " biennale venezia 1996 " poster . now visitors to the biennale can look forward to kippenberger 's phantasmal global underground metro-net project , conceived a few years before his death , to offer 20 seconds of relief from sizzling venetian summer temperatures above 40 c -lrb- 104 f -rrb- .
a subway grate has been installed in the floor of the german pavilion and every five minutes the sound of a train passing and a burst of cool air emanates from it .
kippenberger 's plan was to link the whole world with subway entrances , exits and ventilation grates that led nowhere .
he installed his first entrance in syros , greece in 1993 and planted additional evidence in dawson city , canada and münster , germany . empty rooms in sharp contrast to kippenberger 's virtual subway network , photographer candida höfer focuses on bleak pictures of public rooms devoid of any human presence . " the idea to combine our works appealed to me and i like what came of it , " photographer höfer , told the news agency dpa . born in eberswalde in 1944 , höfer is one of the most important representatives of the bernd and hilla becher school , a german couple , who have had a vast influence on documentary photography and passed on their unique style to scores of students at the düsseldorf art academy . for the biennale , heynen and höfer selected around two dozen photographs of rooms devoid of people , concert halls , libraries , cafés , sport halls and waiting rooms . " i think that because the people are n't visible they are much more recognizable .
you see that the rooms are made for people .
even when you do n't see them , they are there , " höfer told the kölner stadt-anzeiger , her local newspaper at home in cologne . but kippenberger and höfer are not the only german artists in venice .
theater director and perhaps germany 's most famous provocateur christoph schlingensief has positioned seven people " without jobs , homes or religions " as motionless pillars at the entrance to the giardini , where the country pavilions are .
their t-shirts say " church of fear . "
there they are meant to demonstrate their fears , the berlin director has said . art critics doubt though that this year 's german contribution will receive the attention that it did last time around , in 2001 .
then gregor schneider had rooms from his childhood house in rheydt , germany - from the bathroom sink to the electrical wires - moved to venice and installed in the pavilion , which was built in 1938 .
his work won the golden lion as the best of the 65 country contributions . controversy over nefertiti bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen nefertiti 's bronze body .
berlin got a taste of what the biennale might bring last week .
the hungarian art duo " little warsaw , " who will be part of the main exhibition in venice , " dreams and conflicts ; the dictatorship of the viewer , " cast a scantily clad female body in bronze , designed to fit the famous bust of queen nefertiti at berlin 's egyptian museum .
with the permission of the museum , they filmed the more than 3,000-year-old bust mounted on the body in late may to show later at the exhibition in venice . museum director dietrich wildung was subsequently accused of desecrating nefertiti by egyptian officials , who have demanded the sculpture be returned to cairo .
" nefertiti is not in safe hands in berlin , " sahi hawas , the head of the egyptian antiquities department , told the press on june 8 .
hawas and egyptian culture minister faruk husni also took offense to the sculpture 's near nakedness . wildung dismissed the calls for nefertiti 's return .

the green party , german chancellor schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , has given solid support to the chancellor ’ s controversial package of social and economic reforms at a special party conference . chancellor schröder ’ s bold attempts to overhaul germany ’ s overburdened social security system and rigid labor market found further acceptance on sunday with green party voting overwhelmingly in favor of his reform course .
at the end of a two-day special party conference in cottbus , more than 90 percent of the 700 delegates threw their weight behind the controversial reform package known as " agenda 2010 " unveiled by the chancellor in march this year .
the move follows a similar show of support by the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- earlier this month .
the reform package , which has drawn ire from both left-wingers and traditionalists in the spd and greens in recent months , includes capping the amount and duration of unemployment benefits , melding unemployment benefits and welfare benefits into one monthly check , streamlining the health care system and making it easier for german employers to hire and fire people .
" a new perspective for red-green " the green party leadership urged party delegates during the conference to back the much-needed reforms , which are needed to shake germany out of its economic slump and tackle unemployment , and warned that a failure to do so could threaten the coexistence of the spd-green government .
party head reinhard bütikofer said it was a core concern of the greens not to leave a heavily indebted nation to the next generation and that reforming the generous social system was a matter of survival for the coalition .
" " if red-green manage to get a grip on the reforms , then we can even change the mood in the country , " bütikofer said in a reference to the general pessimistic outlook in germany on account of a near-stagnant economy .
the green party ’ s most prominent member and germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer characterized the reform vote as an acid test for green beliefs and principles .
" it ’ s a question of whether we manage to carry through the reforms on our own , instead of leaving it to the right of center parties , " he said .
fischer emphasized the implementation of reforms wasn ’ t just meant for the country , but also to give " a new perspective to red-green . "
critics say reform package socially unfair but despite broad support for the reformist agenda within the greens , several critics within the party have once again voiced fears the reform plans are socially unfair and aren ’ t suitable for solving pressing problems plaguing the country .
green economics expert werner schulz lambasted the chancellor ’ s plans , saying it didn ’ t solve the structural problems , but " rather burdened the weak in a one-sided way with reform costs . "
several left-wingers also criticized " agenda 2010 " as socially unbalanced and a betrayal of basic party principles .
in particular the chancellor ’ s health care reforms which include charging more to patients for prescription drugs in an effort to control spiraling costs have come in for much flak .
in addition , a left-wing base is also renewing its demand for the implementation of the wealth tax , which foresees levying a one percent tax on more prosperous companies and individuals , and managed to push it through with a majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor 's party gives hearty support to reform course chancellor gerhard schröder received stronger-than-awaited backing from his party for a radical reform package that experts say is needed to shake germany out of its economic slump .

amid speculation the u.s. might drastically reduce its troops and their families based in germany , the mayors of 13 german cities that host american bases traveled to washington to plead the personnel be allowed to stay . the u.s. state department is currently reviewing the future of its many u.s. military bases around the world .
in the next few months , it is expected to announce major changes , which could include major cuts to the 70,000 u.s. troops and their families based in germany .
according to a report in the wall street journal , the pentagon wants to pull out 75 percent of u.s. troops from germany over the next few years .
many are to be deployed to countries like poland , hungary or romania , without their families , for six month rotational posts .
the pentagon argues the move will save much money and also allow the forces to be much closer to where they ’ re needed .
german mayors : troop withdrawal will be disastrous but the decision is proving to be a nightmare for the mayors of 13 german cities and towns , which host large american bases .
they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .
that ’ s worth sixty jobs over 20 years .
these kind of things really add up , and will be a major upheaval if the troops pack up and leave , " he told deutsche welle .
u.s. troops well-integrated into german society to make their point , the 13 traveled to washington this week to personally explain to the pentagon , the u.s. state department and even congress that germany is a safe and pleasant home for u.s. troops .
helmut wächter , the mayor of grafenwöhr in bavaria , told deutsche welle he returned feeling somewhat better than when he left .
" our message came across in all of our discussions .
some of those who spoke on our behalf are also based in germany , and through their own experiences , know about , and understand , the special relationships that are formed .
and of course , they will try to convey this message so that washington can take these issues into consideration . "
mayor wächter ’ s sentiments were confirmed by u.s. brigadier-general erwin lessel based in kaiserlautern which is home to 40,000 u.s. troops and their families .
brigadier-general lessel said the troops liked it there and added many of them have become close friends with their german neighbours .
reduction of forces still unclear mayor deubig of kaiserslautern said he expects u.s. forces will be asked to leave germany , but doubts that the figure of 75 percent is accurate .
" that figure has not been confirmed .
but it ’ s been made clear that the discussion is focussed on a reduction of large numbers of u.s. troops . "
the cuts could be interpreted as a rebuke to germany ’ s anti-war stance .
but experts note that the pentagon can ’ t shrink size of its forces in europe too much without risking its status within nato – the north atlantic treaty organization .
the final numbers are expected to be announced in a few months – troop withdrawal could follow as soon as one year later . wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the green party , german chancellor schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , has given solid support to the chancellor ’ s controversial package of social and economic reforms at a special party conference . chancellor schröder ’ s bold attempts to overhaul germany ’ s overburdened social security system and rigid labor market found further acceptance on sunday with green party voting overwhelmingly in favor of his reform course .
at the end of a two-day special party conference in cottbus , more than 90 percent of the 700 delegates threw their weight behind the controversial reform package known as " agenda 2010 " unveiled by the chancellor in march this year .
the move follows a similar show of support by the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- earlier this month .
the reform package , which has drawn ire from both left-wingers and traditionalists in the spd and greens in recent months , includes capping the amount and duration of unemployment benefits , melding unemployment benefits and welfare benefits into one monthly check , streamlining the health care system and making it easier for german employers to hire and fire people .
" a new perspective for red-green " the green party leadership urged party delegates during the conference to back the much-needed reforms , which are needed to shake germany out of its economic slump and tackle unemployment , and warned that a failure to do so could threaten the coexistence of the spd-green government .
party head reinhard bütikofer said it was a core concern of the greens not to leave a heavily indebted nation to the next generation and that reforming the generous social system was a matter of survival for the coalition .
" " if red-green manage to get a grip on the reforms , then we can even change the mood in the country , " bütikofer said in a reference to the general pessimistic outlook in germany on account of a near-stagnant economy .
the green party ’ s most prominent member and germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer characterized the reform vote as an acid test for green beliefs and principles .
" it ’ s a question of whether we manage to carry through the reforms on our own , instead of leaving it to the right of center parties , " he said .
fischer emphasized the implementation of reforms wasn ’ t just meant for the country , but also to give " a new perspective to red-green . "
critics say reform package socially unfair but despite broad support for the reformist agenda within the greens , several critics within the party have once again voiced fears the reform plans are socially unfair and aren ’ t suitable for solving pressing problems plaguing the country .
green economics expert werner schulz lambasted the chancellor ’ s plans , saying it didn ’ t solve the structural problems , but " rather burdened the weak in a one-sided way with reform costs . "
several left-wingers also criticized " agenda 2010 " as socially unbalanced and a betrayal of basic party principles .
in particular the chancellor ’ s health care reforms which include charging more to patients for prescription drugs in an effort to control spiraling costs have come in for much flak .
in addition , a left-wing base is also renewing its demand for the implementation of the wealth tax , which foresees levying a one percent tax on more prosperous companies and individuals , and managed to push it through with a majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor 's party gives hearty support to reform course chancellor gerhard schröder received stronger-than-awaited backing from his party for a radical reform package that experts say is needed to shake germany out of its economic slump .

in the next few months , it is expected to announce major changes , which could include major cuts to the 70,000 u.s. troops and their families based in germany .
according to a report in the wall street journal , the pentagon wants to pull out 75 percent of u.s. troops from germany over the next few years .
many are to be deployed to countries like poland , hungary or romania , without their families , for six month rotational posts .
the pentagon argues the move will save much money and also allow the forces to be much closer to where they ’ re needed .
german mayors : troop withdrawal will be disastrous but the decision is proving to be a nightmare for the mayors of 13 german cities and towns , which host large american bases .
they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .

some of those who spoke on our behalf are also based in germany , and through their own experiences , know about , and understand , the special relationships that are formed .
and of course , they will try to convey this message so that washington can take these issues into consideration . "
mayor wächter ’ s sentiments were confirmed by u.s. brigadier-general erwin lessel based in kaiserlautern which is home to 40,000 u.s. troops and their families .
brigadier-general lessel said the troops liked it there and added many of them have become close friends with their german neighbours .
reduction of forces still unclear mayor deubig of kaiserslautern said he expects u.s. forces will be asked to leave germany , but doubts that the figure of 75 percent is accurate .
" that figure has not been confirmed .

the green party , german chancellor schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , has given solid support to the chancellor ’ s controversial package of social and economic reforms at a special party conference . chancellor schröder ’ s bold attempts to overhaul germany ’ s overburdened social security system and rigid labor market found further acceptance on sunday with green party voting overwhelmingly in favor of his reform course .
at the end of a two-day special party conference in cottbus , more than 90 percent of the 700 delegates threw their weight behind the controversial reform package known as " agenda 2010 " unveiled by the chancellor in march this year .
the move follows a similar show of support by the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- earlier this month .
the reform package , which has drawn ire from both left-wingers and traditionalists in the spd and greens in recent months , includes capping the amount and duration of unemployment benefits , melding unemployment benefits and welfare benefits into one monthly check , streamlining the health care system and making it easier for german employers to hire and fire people .
" a new perspective for red-green " the green party leadership urged party delegates during the conference to back the much-needed reforms , which are needed to shake germany out of its economic slump and tackle unemployment , and warned that a failure to do so could threaten the coexistence of the spd-green government .
party head reinhard bütikofer said it was a core concern of the greens not to leave a heavily indebted nation to the next generation and that reforming the generous social system was a matter of survival for the coalition .
" " if red-green manage to get a grip on the reforms , then we can even change the mood in the country , " bütikofer said in a reference to the general pessimistic outlook in germany on account of a near-stagnant economy .
the green party ’ s most prominent member and germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer characterized the reform vote as an acid test for green beliefs and principles .
" it ’ s a question of whether we manage to carry through the reforms on our own , instead of leaving it to the right of center parties , " he said .
fischer emphasized the implementation of reforms wasn ’ t just meant for the country , but also to give " a new perspective to red-green . "
critics say reform package socially unfair but despite broad support for the reformist agenda within the greens , several critics within the party have once again voiced fears the reform plans are socially unfair and aren ’ t suitable for solving pressing problems plaguing the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.06.2003 venice biennale opens with enigmatic german works großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " globus 2003 " - an installation by brazilian artist rivane neuenschwander at the venice biennale .
martin kippenberger and candida höfer are germany 's representatives at the venice biennale , one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions which opens on sunday in the lagoon city . german curator julian heynen calls the exhibit in the german pavilion at this year 's venice biennale " topography . "
many an art critic has been inclined to scratch his head in confusion over the selection of two vastly different artists for this year 's german showing at the biennale - martin kippenberger who died in 1997 and was a controversial figure in the art world during his lifetime and the cool and severe candida höfer . like the biennale which opens for the 50th time on sunday , martin kippenberger would have been 50 this year too .
he always wanted to be invited to the venice biennale .
again and again the conceptual artist stressed that the only things that would make him go to the city of lagoons were the biennale and his own honeymoon . in the end the controversial artist made it for both occasions , but only the honeymoon took place during his lifetime , just a year before his death in 1997 .
it was an off year , when the exhibition was n't taking place .
kippenberger had himself photographed in front of the empty german pavilion for his " biennale venezia 1996 " poster . now visitors to the biennale can look forward to kippenberger 's phantasmal global underground metro-net project , conceived a few years before his death , to offer 20 seconds of relief from sizzling venetian summer temperatures above 40 c -lrb- 104 f -rrb- .
a subway grate has been installed in the floor of the german pavilion and every five minutes the sound of a train passing and a burst of cool air emanates from it .
kippenberger 's plan was to link the whole world with subway entrances , exits and ventilation grates that led nowhere .
he installed his first entrance in syros , greece in 1993 and planted additional evidence in dawson city , canada and münster , germany . empty rooms in sharp contrast to kippenberger 's virtual subway network , photographer candida höfer focuses on bleak pictures of public rooms devoid of any human presence . " the idea to combine our works appealed to me and i like what came of it , " photographer höfer , told the news agency dpa . born in eberswalde in 1944 , höfer is one of the most important representatives of the bernd and hilla becher school , a german couple , who have had a vast influence on documentary photography and passed on their unique style to scores of students at the düsseldorf art academy . for the biennale , heynen and höfer selected around two dozen photographs of rooms devoid of people , concert halls , libraries , cafés , sport halls and waiting rooms . " i think that because the people are n't visible they are much more recognizable .
you see that the rooms are made for people .
even when you do n't see them , they are there , " höfer told the kölner stadt-anzeiger , her local newspaper at home in cologne . but kippenberger and höfer are not the only german artists in venice .
theater director and perhaps germany 's most famous provocateur christoph schlingensief has positioned seven people " without jobs , homes or religions " as motionless pillars at the entrance to the giardini , where the country pavilions are .
their t-shirts say " church of fear . "
there they are meant to demonstrate their fears , the berlin director has said . art critics doubt though that this year 's german contribution will receive the attention that it did last time around , in 2001 .
then gregor schneider had rooms from his childhood house in rheydt , germany - from the bathroom sink to the electrical wires - moved to venice and installed in the pavilion , which was built in 1938 .
his work won the golden lion as the best of the 65 country contributions . controversy over nefertiti bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen nefertiti 's bronze body .
berlin got a taste of what the biennale might bring last week .
the hungarian art duo " little warsaw , " who will be part of the main exhibition in venice , " dreams and conflicts ; the dictatorship of the viewer , " cast a scantily clad female body in bronze , designed to fit the famous bust of queen nefertiti at berlin 's egyptian museum .
with the permission of the museum , they filmed the more than 3,000-year-old bust mounted on the body in late may to show later at the exhibition in venice . museum director dietrich wildung was subsequently accused of desecrating nefertiti by egyptian officials , who have demanded the sculpture be returned to cairo .
" nefertiti is not in safe hands in berlin , " sahi hawas , the head of the egyptian antiquities department , told the press on june 8 .
hawas and egyptian culture minister faruk husni also took offense to the sculpture 's near nakedness . wildung dismissed the calls for nefertiti 's return .
" that happens every year , " he said .
german archeologists unearthed the bust in 1912 and legally claimed it for germany . the venice biennale will be open until november 2 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the venice biennale web site 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the move follows a similar show of support by the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- earlier this month .
the reform package , which has drawn ire from both left-wingers and traditionalists in the spd and greens in recent months , includes capping the amount and duration of unemployment benefits , melding unemployment benefits and welfare benefits into one monthly check , streamlining the health care system and making it easier for german employers to hire and fire people .
" a new perspective for red-green " the green party leadership urged party delegates during the conference to back the much-needed reforms , which are needed to shake germany out of its economic slump and tackle unemployment , and warned that a failure to do so could threaten the coexistence of the spd-green government .
party head reinhard bütikofer said it was a core concern of the greens not to leave a heavily indebted nation to the next generation and that reforming the generous social system was a matter of survival for the coalition .
" " if red-green manage to get a grip on the reforms , then we can even change the mood in the country , " bütikofer said in a reference to the general pessimistic outlook in germany on account of a near-stagnant economy .
the green party ’ s most prominent member and germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer characterized the reform vote as an acid test for green beliefs and principles .
" it ’ s a question of whether we manage to carry through the reforms on our own , instead of leaving it to the right of center parties , " he said .
fischer emphasized the implementation of reforms wasn ’ t just meant for the country , but also to give " a new perspective to red-green . "
critics say reform package socially unfair but despite broad support for the reformist agenda within the greens , several critics within the party have once again voiced fears the reform plans are socially unfair and aren ’ t suitable for solving pressing problems plaguing the country .
green economics expert werner schulz lambasted the chancellor ’ s plans , saying it didn ’ t solve the structural problems , but " rather burdened the weak in a one-sided way with reform costs . "
several left-wingers also criticized " agenda 2010 " as socially unbalanced and a betrayal of basic party principles .
in particular the chancellor ’ s health care reforms which include charging more to patients for prescription drugs in an effort to control spiraling costs have come in for much flak .
in addition , a left-wing base is also renewing its demand for the implementation of the wealth tax , which foresees levying a one percent tax on more prosperous companies and individuals , and managed to push it through with a majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor 's party gives hearty support to reform course chancellor gerhard schröder received stronger-than-awaited backing from his party for a radical reform package that experts say is needed to shake germany out of its economic slump .

martin kippenberger and candida höfer are germany 's representatives at the venice biennale , one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions which opens on sunday in the lagoon city . german curator julian heynen calls the exhibit in the german pavilion at this year 's venice biennale " topography . "
many an art critic has been inclined to scratch his head in confusion over the selection of two vastly different artists for this year 's german showing at the biennale - martin kippenberger who died in 1997 and was a controversial figure in the art world during his lifetime and the cool and severe candida höfer . like the biennale which opens for the 50th time on sunday , martin kippenberger would have been 50 this year too .
he always wanted to be invited to the venice biennale .
again and again the conceptual artist stressed that the only things that would make him go to the city of lagoons were the biennale and his own honeymoon . in the end the controversial artist made it for both occasions , but only the honeymoon took place during his lifetime , just a year before his death in 1997 .
it was an off year , when the exhibition was n't taking place .
kippenberger had himself photographed in front of the empty german pavilion for his " biennale venezia 1996 " poster . now visitors to the biennale can look forward to kippenberger 's phantasmal global underground metro-net project , conceived a few years before his death , to offer 20 seconds of relief from sizzling venetian summer temperatures above 40 c -lrb- 104 f -rrb- .
a subway grate has been installed in the floor of the german pavilion and every five minutes the sound of a train passing and a burst of cool air emanates from it .
kippenberger 's plan was to link the whole world with subway entrances , exits and ventilation grates that led nowhere .
he installed his first entrance in syros , greece in 1993 and planted additional evidence in dawson city , canada and münster , germany . empty rooms in sharp contrast to kippenberger 's virtual subway network , photographer candida höfer focuses on bleak pictures of public rooms devoid of any human presence . " the idea to combine our works appealed to me and i like what came of it , " photographer höfer , told the news agency dpa . born in eberswalde in 1944 , höfer is one of the most important representatives of the bernd and hilla becher school , a german couple , who have had a vast influence on documentary photography and passed on their unique style to scores of students at the düsseldorf art academy . for the biennale , heynen and höfer selected around two dozen photographs of rooms devoid of people , concert halls , libraries , cafés , sport halls and waiting rooms . " i think that because the people are n't visible they are much more recognizable .
you see that the rooms are made for people .
even when you do n't see them , they are there , " höfer told the kölner stadt-anzeiger , her local newspaper at home in cologne . but kippenberger and höfer are not the only german artists in venice .
theater director and perhaps germany 's most famous provocateur christoph schlingensief has positioned seven people " without jobs , homes or religions " as motionless pillars at the entrance to the giardini , where the country pavilions are .
their t-shirts say " church of fear . "
there they are meant to demonstrate their fears , the berlin director has said . art critics doubt though that this year 's german contribution will receive the attention that it did last time around , in 2001 .
then gregor schneider had rooms from his childhood house in rheydt , germany - from the bathroom sink to the electrical wires - moved to venice and installed in the pavilion , which was built in 1938 .

with the permission of the museum , they filmed the more than 3,000-year-old bust mounted on the body in late may to show later at the exhibition in venice . museum director dietrich wildung was subsequently accused of desecrating nefertiti by egyptian officials , who have demanded the sculpture be returned to cairo .

the green party , german chancellor schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , has given solid support to the chancellor ’ s controversial package of social and economic reforms at a special party conference . chancellor schröder ’ s bold attempts to overhaul germany ’ s overburdened social security system and rigid labor market found further acceptance on sunday with green party voting overwhelmingly in favor of his reform course .
at the end of a two-day special party conference in cottbus , more than 90 percent of the 700 delegates threw their weight behind the controversial reform package known as " agenda 2010 " unveiled by the chancellor in march this year .
the move follows a similar show of support by the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- earlier this month .
the reform package , which has drawn ire from both left-wingers and traditionalists in the spd and greens in recent months , includes capping the amount and duration of unemployment benefits , melding unemployment benefits and welfare benefits into one monthly check , streamlining the health care system and making it easier for german employers to hire and fire people .
" a new perspective for red-green " the green party leadership urged party delegates during the conference to back the much-needed reforms , which are needed to shake germany out of its economic slump and tackle unemployment , and warned that a failure to do so could threaten the coexistence of the spd-green government .
party head reinhard bütikofer said it was a core concern of the greens not to leave a heavily indebted nation to the next generation and that reforming the generous social system was a matter of survival for the coalition .
" " if red-green manage to get a grip on the reforms , then we can even change the mood in the country , " bütikofer said in a reference to the general pessimistic outlook in germany on account of a near-stagnant economy .
the green party ’ s most prominent member and germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer characterized the reform vote as an acid test for green beliefs and principles .
" it ’ s a question of whether we manage to carry through the reforms on our own , instead of leaving it to the right of center parties , " he said .
fischer emphasized the implementation of reforms wasn ’ t just meant for the country , but also to give " a new perspective to red-green . "
critics say reform package socially unfair but despite broad support for the reformist agenda within the greens , several critics within the party have once again voiced fears the reform plans are socially unfair and aren ’ t suitable for solving pressing problems plaguing the country .
green economics expert werner schulz lambasted the chancellor ’ s plans , saying it didn ’ t solve the structural problems , but " rather burdened the weak in a one-sided way with reform costs . "
several left-wingers also criticized " agenda 2010 " as socially unbalanced and a betrayal of basic party principles .
in particular the chancellor ’ s health care reforms which include charging more to patients for prescription drugs in an effort to control spiraling costs have come in for much flak .
in addition , a left-wing base is also renewing its demand for the implementation of the wealth tax , which foresees levying a one percent tax on more prosperous companies and individuals , and managed to push it through with a majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor 's party gives hearty support to reform course chancellor gerhard schröder received stronger-than-awaited backing from his party for a radical reform package that experts say is needed to shake germany out of its economic slump .

martin kippenberger and candida höfer are germany 's representatives at the venice biennale , one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions which opens on sunday in the lagoon city . german curator julian heynen calls the exhibit in the german pavilion at this year 's venice biennale " topography . "
many an art critic has been inclined to scratch his head in confusion over the selection of two vastly different artists for this year 's german showing at the biennale - martin kippenberger who died in 1997 and was a controversial figure in the art world during his lifetime and the cool and severe candida höfer . like the biennale which opens for the 50th time on sunday , martin kippenberger would have been 50 this year too .
he always wanted to be invited to the venice biennale .
again and again the conceptual artist stressed that the only things that would make him go to the city of lagoons were the biennale and his own honeymoon . in the end the controversial artist made it for both occasions , but only the honeymoon took place during his lifetime , just a year before his death in 1997 .
it was an off year , when the exhibition was n't taking place .
kippenberger had himself photographed in front of the empty german pavilion for his " biennale venezia 1996 " poster . now visitors to the biennale can look forward to kippenberger 's phantasmal global underground metro-net project , conceived a few years before his death , to offer 20 seconds of relief from sizzling venetian summer temperatures above 40 c -lrb- 104 f -rrb- .
a subway grate has been installed in the floor of the german pavilion and every five minutes the sound of a train passing and a burst of cool air emanates from it .
kippenberger 's plan was to link the whole world with subway entrances , exits and ventilation grates that led nowhere .
he installed his first entrance in syros , greece in 1993 and planted additional evidence in dawson city , canada and münster , germany . empty rooms in sharp contrast to kippenberger 's virtual subway network , photographer candida höfer focuses on bleak pictures of public rooms devoid of any human presence . " the idea to combine our works appealed to me and i like what came of it , " photographer höfer , told the news agency dpa . born in eberswalde in 1944 , höfer is one of the most important representatives of the bernd and hilla becher school , a german couple , who have had a vast influence on documentary photography and passed on their unique style to scores of students at the düsseldorf art academy . for the biennale , heynen and höfer selected around two dozen photographs of rooms devoid of people , concert halls , libraries , cafés , sport halls and waiting rooms . " i think that because the people are n't visible they are much more recognizable .
you see that the rooms are made for people .
even when you do n't see them , they are there , " höfer told the kölner stadt-anzeiger , her local newspaper at home in cologne . but kippenberger and höfer are not the only german artists in venice .
theater director and perhaps germany 's most famous provocateur christoph schlingensief has positioned seven people " without jobs , homes or religions " as motionless pillars at the entrance to the giardini , where the country pavilions are .
their t-shirts say " church of fear . "
there they are meant to demonstrate their fears , the berlin director has said . art critics doubt though that this year 's german contribution will receive the attention that it did last time around , in 2001 .
then gregor schneider had rooms from his childhood house in rheydt , germany - from the bathroom sink to the electrical wires - moved to venice and installed in the pavilion , which was built in 1938 .
his work won the golden lion as the best of the 65 country contributions . controversy over nefertiti bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen nefertiti 's bronze body .
berlin got a taste of what the biennale might bring last week .
the hungarian art duo " little warsaw , " who will be part of the main exhibition in venice , " dreams and conflicts ; the dictatorship of the viewer , " cast a scantily clad female body in bronze , designed to fit the famous bust of queen nefertiti at berlin 's egyptian museum .
with the permission of the museum , they filmed the more than 3,000-year-old bust mounted on the body in late may to show later at the exhibition in venice . museum director dietrich wildung was subsequently accused of desecrating nefertiti by egyptian officials , who have demanded the sculpture be returned to cairo .
" nefertiti is not in safe hands in berlin , " sahi hawas , the head of the egyptian antiquities department , told the press on june 8 .
hawas and egyptian culture minister faruk husni also took offense to the sculpture 's near nakedness . wildung dismissed the calls for nefertiti 's return .

amid speculation the u.s. might drastically reduce its troops and their families based in germany , the mayors of 13 german cities that host american bases traveled to washington to plead the personnel be allowed to stay . the u.s. state department is currently reviewing the future of its many u.s. military bases around the world .
in the next few months , it is expected to announce major changes , which could include major cuts to the 70,000 u.s. troops and their families based in germany .
according to a report in the wall street journal , the pentagon wants to pull out 75 percent of u.s. troops from germany over the next few years .
many are to be deployed to countries like poland , hungary or romania , without their families , for six month rotational posts .
the pentagon argues the move will save much money and also allow the forces to be much closer to where they ’ re needed .
german mayors : troop withdrawal will be disastrous but the decision is proving to be a nightmare for the mayors of 13 german cities and towns , which host large american bases .
they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .
that ’ s worth sixty jobs over 20 years .
these kind of things really add up , and will be a major upheaval if the troops pack up and leave , " he told deutsche welle .
u.s. troops well-integrated into german society to make their point , the 13 traveled to washington this week to personally explain to the pentagon , the u.s. state department and even congress that germany is a safe and pleasant home for u.s. troops .
helmut wächter , the mayor of grafenwöhr in bavaria , told deutsche welle he returned feeling somewhat better than when he left .
" our message came across in all of our discussions .
some of those who spoke on our behalf are also based in germany , and through their own experiences , know about , and understand , the special relationships that are formed .
and of course , they will try to convey this message so that washington can take these issues into consideration . "
mayor wächter ’ s sentiments were confirmed by u.s. brigadier-general erwin lessel based in kaiserlautern which is home to 40,000 u.s. troops and their families .
brigadier-general lessel said the troops liked it there and added many of them have become close friends with their german neighbours .
reduction of forces still unclear mayor deubig of kaiserslautern said he expects u.s. forces will be asked to leave germany , but doubts that the figure of 75 percent is accurate .
" that figure has not been confirmed .
but it ’ s been made clear that the discussion is focussed on a reduction of large numbers of u.s. troops . "
the cuts could be interpreted as a rebuke to germany ’ s anti-war stance .
but experts note that the pentagon can ’ t shrink size of its forces in europe too much without risking its status within nato – the north atlantic treaty organization .
the final numbers are expected to be announced in a few months – troop withdrawal could follow as soon as one year later . wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

amid speculation the u.s. might drastically reduce its troops and their families based in germany , the mayors of 13 german cities that host american bases traveled to washington to plead the personnel be allowed to stay . the u.s. state department is currently reviewing the future of its many u.s. military bases around the world .
in the next few months , it is expected to announce major changes , which could include major cuts to the 70,000 u.s. troops and their families based in germany .
according to a report in the wall street journal , the pentagon wants to pull out 75 percent of u.s. troops from germany over the next few years .
many are to be deployed to countries like poland , hungary or romania , without their families , for six month rotational posts .
the pentagon argues the move will save much money and also allow the forces to be much closer to where they ’ re needed .
german mayors : troop withdrawal will be disastrous but the decision is proving to be a nightmare for the mayors of 13 german cities and towns , which host large american bases .
they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .
that ’ s worth sixty jobs over 20 years .
these kind of things really add up , and will be a major upheaval if the troops pack up and leave , " he told deutsche welle .
u.s. troops well-integrated into german society to make their point , the 13 traveled to washington this week to personally explain to the pentagon , the u.s. state department and even congress that germany is a safe and pleasant home for u.s. troops .
helmut wächter , the mayor of grafenwöhr in bavaria , told deutsche welle he returned feeling somewhat better than when he left .

martin kippenberger and candida höfer are germany 's representatives at the venice biennale , one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions which opens on sunday in the lagoon city . german curator julian heynen calls the exhibit in the german pavilion at this year 's venice biennale " topography . "
many an art critic has been inclined to scratch his head in confusion over the selection of two vastly different artists for this year 's german showing at the biennale - martin kippenberger who died in 1997 and was a controversial figure in the art world during his lifetime and the cool and severe candida höfer . like the biennale which opens for the 50th time on sunday , martin kippenberger would have been 50 this year too .
he always wanted to be invited to the venice biennale .
again and again the conceptual artist stressed that the only things that would make him go to the city of lagoons were the biennale and his own honeymoon . in the end the controversial artist made it for both occasions , but only the honeymoon took place during his lifetime , just a year before his death in 1997 .
it was an off year , when the exhibition was n't taking place .
kippenberger had himself photographed in front of the empty german pavilion for his " biennale venezia 1996 " poster . now visitors to the biennale can look forward to kippenberger 's phantasmal global underground metro-net project , conceived a few years before his death , to offer 20 seconds of relief from sizzling venetian summer temperatures above 40 c -lrb- 104 f -rrb- .
a subway grate has been installed in the floor of the german pavilion and every five minutes the sound of a train passing and a burst of cool air emanates from it .
kippenberger 's plan was to link the whole world with subway entrances , exits and ventilation grates that led nowhere .
he installed his first entrance in syros , greece in 1993 and planted additional evidence in dawson city , canada and münster , germany . empty rooms in sharp contrast to kippenberger 's virtual subway network , photographer candida höfer focuses on bleak pictures of public rooms devoid of any human presence . " the idea to combine our works appealed to me and i like what came of it , " photographer höfer , told the news agency dpa . born in eberswalde in 1944 , höfer is one of the most important representatives of the bernd and hilla becher school , a german couple , who have had a vast influence on documentary photography and passed on their unique style to scores of students at the düsseldorf art academy . for the biennale , heynen and höfer selected around two dozen photographs of rooms devoid of people , concert halls , libraries , cafés , sport halls and waiting rooms . " i think that because the people are n't visible they are much more recognizable .
you see that the rooms are made for people .
even when you do n't see them , they are there , " höfer told the kölner stadt-anzeiger , her local newspaper at home in cologne . but kippenberger and höfer are not the only german artists in venice .
theater director and perhaps germany 's most famous provocateur christoph schlingensief has positioned seven people " without jobs , homes or religions " as motionless pillars at the entrance to the giardini , where the country pavilions are .
their t-shirts say " church of fear . "
there they are meant to demonstrate their fears , the berlin director has said . art critics doubt though that this year 's german contribution will receive the attention that it did last time around , in 2001 .
then gregor schneider had rooms from his childhood house in rheydt , germany - from the bathroom sink to the electrical wires - moved to venice and installed in the pavilion , which was built in 1938 .
his work won the golden lion as the best of the 65 country contributions . controversy over nefertiti bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen nefertiti 's bronze body .
berlin got a taste of what the biennale might bring last week .
the hungarian art duo " little warsaw , " who will be part of the main exhibition in venice , " dreams and conflicts ; the dictatorship of the viewer , " cast a scantily clad female body in bronze , designed to fit the famous bust of queen nefertiti at berlin 's egyptian museum .
with the permission of the museum , they filmed the more than 3,000-year-old bust mounted on the body in late may to show later at the exhibition in venice . museum director dietrich wildung was subsequently accused of desecrating nefertiti by egyptian officials , who have demanded the sculpture be returned to cairo .
" nefertiti is not in safe hands in berlin , " sahi hawas , the head of the egyptian antiquities department , told the press on june 8 .
hawas and egyptian culture minister faruk husni also took offense to the sculpture 's near nakedness . wildung dismissed the calls for nefertiti 's return .

martin kippenberger and candida höfer are germany 's representatives at the venice biennale , one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions which opens on sunday in the lagoon city . german curator julian heynen calls the exhibit in the german pavilion at this year 's venice biennale " topography . "
many an art critic has been inclined to scratch his head in confusion over the selection of two vastly different artists for this year 's german showing at the biennale - martin kippenberger who died in 1997 and was a controversial figure in the art world during his lifetime and the cool and severe candida höfer . like the biennale which opens for the 50th time on sunday , martin kippenberger would have been 50 this year too .
he always wanted to be invited to the venice biennale .
again and again the conceptual artist stressed that the only things that would make him go to the city of lagoons were the biennale and his own honeymoon . in the end the controversial artist made it for both occasions , but only the honeymoon took place during his lifetime , just a year before his death in 1997 .
it was an off year , when the exhibition was n't taking place .
kippenberger had himself photographed in front of the empty german pavilion for his " biennale venezia 1996 " poster . now visitors to the biennale can look forward to kippenberger 's phantasmal global underground metro-net project , conceived a few years before his death , to offer 20 seconds of relief from sizzling venetian summer temperatures above 40 c -lrb- 104 f -rrb- .
a subway grate has been installed in the floor of the german pavilion and every five minutes the sound of a train passing and a burst of cool air emanates from it .
kippenberger 's plan was to link the whole world with subway entrances , exits and ventilation grates that led nowhere .
he installed his first entrance in syros , greece in 1993 and planted additional evidence in dawson city , canada and münster , germany . empty rooms in sharp contrast to kippenberger 's virtual subway network , photographer candida höfer focuses on bleak pictures of public rooms devoid of any human presence . " the idea to combine our works appealed to me and i like what came of it , " photographer höfer , told the news agency dpa . born in eberswalde in 1944 , höfer is one of the most important representatives of the bernd and hilla becher school , a german couple , who have had a vast influence on documentary photography and passed on their unique style to scores of students at the düsseldorf art academy . for the biennale , heynen and höfer selected around two dozen photographs of rooms devoid of people , concert halls , libraries , cafés , sport halls and waiting rooms . " i think that because the people are n't visible they are much more recognizable .
you see that the rooms are made for people .
even when you do n't see them , they are there , " höfer told the kölner stadt-anzeiger , her local newspaper at home in cologne . but kippenberger and höfer are not the only german artists in venice .

the green party , german chancellor schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , has given solid support to the chancellor ’ s controversial package of social and economic reforms at a special party conference . chancellor schröder ’ s bold attempts to overhaul germany ’ s overburdened social security system and rigid labor market found further acceptance on sunday with green party voting overwhelmingly in favor of his reform course .
at the end of a two-day special party conference in cottbus , more than 90 percent of the 700 delegates threw their weight behind the controversial reform package known as " agenda 2010 " unveiled by the chancellor in march this year .
the move follows a similar show of support by the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- earlier this month .
the reform package , which has drawn ire from both left-wingers and traditionalists in the spd and greens in recent months , includes capping the amount and duration of unemployment benefits , melding unemployment benefits and welfare benefits into one monthly check , streamlining the health care system and making it easier for german employers to hire and fire people .
" a new perspective for red-green " the green party leadership urged party delegates during the conference to back the much-needed reforms , which are needed to shake germany out of its economic slump and tackle unemployment , and warned that a failure to do so could threaten the coexistence of the spd-green government .
party head reinhard bütikofer said it was a core concern of the greens not to leave a heavily indebted nation to the next generation and that reforming the generous social system was a matter of survival for the coalition .
" " if red-green manage to get a grip on the reforms , then we can even change the mood in the country , " bütikofer said in a reference to the general pessimistic outlook in germany on account of a near-stagnant economy .
the green party ’ s most prominent member and germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer characterized the reform vote as an acid test for green beliefs and principles .
" it ’ s a question of whether we manage to carry through the reforms on our own , instead of leaving it to the right of center parties , " he said .
fischer emphasized the implementation of reforms wasn ’ t just meant for the country , but also to give " a new perspective to red-green . "
critics say reform package socially unfair but despite broad support for the reformist agenda within the greens , several critics within the party have once again voiced fears the reform plans are socially unfair and aren ’ t suitable for solving pressing problems plaguing the country .
green economics expert werner schulz lambasted the chancellor ’ s plans , saying it didn ’ t solve the structural problems , but " rather burdened the weak in a one-sided way with reform costs . "
several left-wingers also criticized " agenda 2010 " as socially unbalanced and a betrayal of basic party principles .
in particular the chancellor ’ s health care reforms which include charging more to patients for prescription drugs in an effort to control spiraling costs have come in for much flak .
in addition , a left-wing base is also renewing its demand for the implementation of the wealth tax , which foresees levying a one percent tax on more prosperous companies and individuals , and managed to push it through with a majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor 's party gives hearty support to reform course chancellor gerhard schröder received stronger-than-awaited backing from his party for a radical reform package that experts say is needed to shake germany out of its economic slump .

the green party , german chancellor schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , has given solid support to the chancellor ’ s controversial package of social and economic reforms at a special party conference . chancellor schröder ’ s bold attempts to overhaul germany ’ s overburdened social security system and rigid labor market found further acceptance on sunday with green party voting overwhelmingly in favor of his reform course .
at the end of a two-day special party conference in cottbus , more than 90 percent of the 700 delegates threw their weight behind the controversial reform package known as " agenda 2010 " unveiled by the chancellor in march this year .
the move follows a similar show of support by the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- earlier this month .
the reform package , which has drawn ire from both left-wingers and traditionalists in the spd and greens in recent months , includes capping the amount and duration of unemployment benefits , melding unemployment benefits and welfare benefits into one monthly check , streamlining the health care system and making it easier for german employers to hire and fire people .
" a new perspective for red-green " the green party leadership urged party delegates during the conference to back the much-needed reforms , which are needed to shake germany out of its economic slump and tackle unemployment , and warned that a failure to do so could threaten the coexistence of the spd-green government .
party head reinhard bütikofer said it was a core concern of the greens not to leave a heavily indebted nation to the next generation and that reforming the generous social system was a matter of survival for the coalition .
" " if red-green manage to get a grip on the reforms , then we can even change the mood in the country , " bütikofer said in a reference to the general pessimistic outlook in germany on account of a near-stagnant economy .
the green party ’ s most prominent member and germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer characterized the reform vote as an acid test for green beliefs and principles .

amid speculation the u.s. might drastically reduce its troops and their families based in germany , the mayors of 13 german cities that host american bases traveled to washington to plead the personnel be allowed to stay . the u.s. state department is currently reviewing the future of its many u.s. military bases around the world .
in the next few months , it is expected to announce major changes , which could include major cuts to the 70,000 u.s. troops and their families based in germany .
according to a report in the wall street journal , the pentagon wants to pull out 75 percent of u.s. troops from germany over the next few years .
many are to be deployed to countries like poland , hungary or romania , without their families , for six month rotational posts .
the pentagon argues the move will save much money and also allow the forces to be much closer to where they ’ re needed .
german mayors : troop withdrawal will be disastrous but the decision is proving to be a nightmare for the mayors of 13 german cities and towns , which host large american bases .
they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .
that ’ s worth sixty jobs over 20 years .
these kind of things really add up , and will be a major upheaval if the troops pack up and leave , " he told deutsche welle .
u.s. troops well-integrated into german society to make their point , the 13 traveled to washington this week to personally explain to the pentagon , the u.s. state department and even congress that germany is a safe and pleasant home for u.s. troops .
helmut wächter , the mayor of grafenwöhr in bavaria , told deutsche welle he returned feeling somewhat better than when he left .
" our message came across in all of our discussions .
some of those who spoke on our behalf are also based in germany , and through their own experiences , know about , and understand , the special relationships that are formed .
and of course , they will try to convey this message so that washington can take these issues into consideration . "
mayor wächter ’ s sentiments were confirmed by u.s. brigadier-general erwin lessel based in kaiserlautern which is home to 40,000 u.s. troops and their families .
brigadier-general lessel said the troops liked it there and added many of them have become close friends with their german neighbours .
reduction of forces still unclear mayor deubig of kaiserslautern said he expects u.s. forces will be asked to leave germany , but doubts that the figure of 75 percent is accurate .
" that figure has not been confirmed .
but it ’ s been made clear that the discussion is focussed on a reduction of large numbers of u.s. troops . "
the cuts could be interpreted as a rebuke to germany ’ s anti-war stance .
but experts note that the pentagon can ’ t shrink size of its forces in europe too much without risking its status within nato – the north atlantic treaty organization .
the final numbers are expected to be announced in a few months – troop withdrawal could follow as soon as one year later . wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

amid speculation the u.s. might drastically reduce its troops and their families based in germany , the mayors of 13 german cities that host american bases traveled to washington to plead the personnel be allowed to stay . the u.s. state department is currently reviewing the future of its many u.s. military bases around the world .
in the next few months , it is expected to announce major changes , which could include major cuts to the 70,000 u.s. troops and their families based in germany .
according to a report in the wall street journal , the pentagon wants to pull out 75 percent of u.s. troops from germany over the next few years .
many are to be deployed to countries like poland , hungary or romania , without their families , for six month rotational posts .
the pentagon argues the move will save much money and also allow the forces to be much closer to where they ’ re needed .
german mayors : troop withdrawal will be disastrous but the decision is proving to be a nightmare for the mayors of 13 german cities and towns , which host large american bases .
they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .

martin kippenberger and candida höfer are germany 's representatives at the venice biennale , one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions which opens on sunday in the lagoon city . german curator julian heynen calls the exhibit in the german pavilion at this year 's venice biennale " topography . "
many an art critic has been inclined to scratch his head in confusion over the selection of two vastly different artists for this year 's german showing at the biennale - martin kippenberger who died in 1997 and was a controversial figure in the art world during his lifetime and the cool and severe candida höfer . like the biennale which opens for the 50th time on sunday , martin kippenberger would have been 50 this year too .
he always wanted to be invited to the venice biennale .
again and again the conceptual artist stressed that the only things that would make him go to the city of lagoons were the biennale and his own honeymoon . in the end the controversial artist made it for both occasions , but only the honeymoon took place during his lifetime , just a year before his death in 1997 .
it was an off year , when the exhibition was n't taking place .
kippenberger had himself photographed in front of the empty german pavilion for his " biennale venezia 1996 " poster . now visitors to the biennale can look forward to kippenberger 's phantasmal global underground metro-net project , conceived a few years before his death , to offer 20 seconds of relief from sizzling venetian summer temperatures above 40 c -lrb- 104 f -rrb- .
a subway grate has been installed in the floor of the german pavilion and every five minutes the sound of a train passing and a burst of cool air emanates from it .
kippenberger 's plan was to link the whole world with subway entrances , exits and ventilation grates that led nowhere .
he installed his first entrance in syros , greece in 1993 and planted additional evidence in dawson city , canada and münster , germany . empty rooms in sharp contrast to kippenberger 's virtual subway network , photographer candida höfer focuses on bleak pictures of public rooms devoid of any human presence . " the idea to combine our works appealed to me and i like what came of it , " photographer höfer , told the news agency dpa . born in eberswalde in 1944 , höfer is one of the most important representatives of the bernd and hilla becher school , a german couple , who have had a vast influence on documentary photography and passed on their unique style to scores of students at the düsseldorf art academy . for the biennale , heynen and höfer selected around two dozen photographs of rooms devoid of people , concert halls , libraries , cafés , sport halls and waiting rooms . " i think that because the people are n't visible they are much more recognizable .
you see that the rooms are made for people .
even when you do n't see them , they are there , " höfer told the kölner stadt-anzeiger , her local newspaper at home in cologne . but kippenberger and höfer are not the only german artists in venice .
theater director and perhaps germany 's most famous provocateur christoph schlingensief has positioned seven people " without jobs , homes or religions " as motionless pillars at the entrance to the giardini , where the country pavilions are .
their t-shirts say " church of fear . "
there they are meant to demonstrate their fears , the berlin director has said . art critics doubt though that this year 's german contribution will receive the attention that it did last time around , in 2001 .
then gregor schneider had rooms from his childhood house in rheydt , germany - from the bathroom sink to the electrical wires - moved to venice and installed in the pavilion , which was built in 1938 .
his work won the golden lion as the best of the 65 country contributions . controversy over nefertiti bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen nefertiti 's bronze body .
berlin got a taste of what the biennale might bring last week .
the hungarian art duo " little warsaw , " who will be part of the main exhibition in venice , " dreams and conflicts ; the dictatorship of the viewer , " cast a scantily clad female body in bronze , designed to fit the famous bust of queen nefertiti at berlin 's egyptian museum .
with the permission of the museum , they filmed the more than 3,000-year-old bust mounted on the body in late may to show later at the exhibition in venice . museum director dietrich wildung was subsequently accused of desecrating nefertiti by egyptian officials , who have demanded the sculpture be returned to cairo .
" nefertiti is not in safe hands in berlin , " sahi hawas , the head of the egyptian antiquities department , told the press on june 8 .
hawas and egyptian culture minister faruk husni also took offense to the sculpture 's near nakedness . wildung dismissed the calls for nefertiti 's return .

amid speculation the u.s. might drastically reduce its troops and their families based in germany , the mayors of 13 german cities that host american bases traveled to washington to plead the personnel be allowed to stay . the u.s. state department is currently reviewing the future of its many u.s. military bases around the world .
in the next few months , it is expected to announce major changes , which could include major cuts to the 70,000 u.s. troops and their families based in germany .
according to a report in the wall street journal , the pentagon wants to pull out 75 percent of u.s. troops from germany over the next few years .
many are to be deployed to countries like poland , hungary or romania , without their families , for six month rotational posts .
the pentagon argues the move will save much money and also allow the forces to be much closer to where they ’ re needed .
german mayors : troop withdrawal will be disastrous but the decision is proving to be a nightmare for the mayors of 13 german cities and towns , which host large american bases .
they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .
that ’ s worth sixty jobs over 20 years .
these kind of things really add up , and will be a major upheaval if the troops pack up and leave , " he told deutsche welle .
u.s. troops well-integrated into german society to make their point , the 13 traveled to washington this week to personally explain to the pentagon , the u.s. state department and even congress that germany is a safe and pleasant home for u.s. troops .
helmut wächter , the mayor of grafenwöhr in bavaria , told deutsche welle he returned feeling somewhat better than when he left .
" our message came across in all of our discussions .
some of those who spoke on our behalf are also based in germany , and through their own experiences , know about , and understand , the special relationships that are formed .
and of course , they will try to convey this message so that washington can take these issues into consideration . "
mayor wächter ’ s sentiments were confirmed by u.s. brigadier-general erwin lessel based in kaiserlautern which is home to 40,000 u.s. troops and their families .
brigadier-general lessel said the troops liked it there and added many of them have become close friends with their german neighbours .
reduction of forces still unclear mayor deubig of kaiserslautern said he expects u.s. forces will be asked to leave germany , but doubts that the figure of 75 percent is accurate .
" that figure has not been confirmed .
but it ’ s been made clear that the discussion is focussed on a reduction of large numbers of u.s. troops . "
the cuts could be interpreted as a rebuke to germany ’ s anti-war stance .
but experts note that the pentagon can ’ t shrink size of its forces in europe too much without risking its status within nato – the north atlantic treaty organization .
the final numbers are expected to be announced in a few months – troop withdrawal could follow as soon as one year later . wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the green party , german chancellor schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , has given solid support to the chancellor ’ s controversial package of social and economic reforms at a special party conference . chancellor schröder ’ s bold attempts to overhaul germany ’ s overburdened social security system and rigid labor market found further acceptance on sunday with green party voting overwhelmingly in favor of his reform course .
at the end of a two-day special party conference in cottbus , more than 90 percent of the 700 delegates threw their weight behind the controversial reform package known as " agenda 2010 " unveiled by the chancellor in march this year .
the move follows a similar show of support by the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- earlier this month .
the reform package , which has drawn ire from both left-wingers and traditionalists in the spd and greens in recent months , includes capping the amount and duration of unemployment benefits , melding unemployment benefits and welfare benefits into one monthly check , streamlining the health care system and making it easier for german employers to hire and fire people .
" a new perspective for red-green " the green party leadership urged party delegates during the conference to back the much-needed reforms , which are needed to shake germany out of its economic slump and tackle unemployment , and warned that a failure to do so could threaten the coexistence of the spd-green government .
party head reinhard bütikofer said it was a core concern of the greens not to leave a heavily indebted nation to the next generation and that reforming the generous social system was a matter of survival for the coalition .
" " if red-green manage to get a grip on the reforms , then we can even change the mood in the country , " bütikofer said in a reference to the general pessimistic outlook in germany on account of a near-stagnant economy .
the green party ’ s most prominent member and germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer characterized the reform vote as an acid test for green beliefs and principles .
" it ’ s a question of whether we manage to carry through the reforms on our own , instead of leaving it to the right of center parties , " he said .
fischer emphasized the implementation of reforms wasn ’ t just meant for the country , but also to give " a new perspective to red-green . "
critics say reform package socially unfair but despite broad support for the reformist agenda within the greens , several critics within the party have once again voiced fears the reform plans are socially unfair and aren ’ t suitable for solving pressing problems plaguing the country .
green economics expert werner schulz lambasted the chancellor ’ s plans , saying it didn ’ t solve the structural problems , but " rather burdened the weak in a one-sided way with reform costs . "
several left-wingers also criticized " agenda 2010 " as socially unbalanced and a betrayal of basic party principles .
in particular the chancellor ’ s health care reforms which include charging more to patients for prescription drugs in an effort to control spiraling costs have come in for much flak .
in addition , a left-wing base is also renewing its demand for the implementation of the wealth tax , which foresees levying a one percent tax on more prosperous companies and individuals , and managed to push it through with a majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor 's party gives hearty support to reform course chancellor gerhard schröder received stronger-than-awaited backing from his party for a radical reform package that experts say is needed to shake germany out of its economic slump .

martin kippenberger and candida höfer are germany 's representatives at the venice biennale , one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions which opens on sunday in the lagoon city . german curator julian heynen calls the exhibit in the german pavilion at this year 's venice biennale " topography . "
many an art critic has been inclined to scratch his head in confusion over the selection of two vastly different artists for this year 's german showing at the biennale - martin kippenberger who died in 1997 and was a controversial figure in the art world during his lifetime and the cool and severe candida höfer . like the biennale which opens for the 50th time on sunday , martin kippenberger would have been 50 this year too .
he always wanted to be invited to the venice biennale .
again and again the conceptual artist stressed that the only things that would make him go to the city of lagoons were the biennale and his own honeymoon . in the end the controversial artist made it for both occasions , but only the honeymoon took place during his lifetime , just a year before his death in 1997 .
it was an off year , when the exhibition was n't taking place .
kippenberger had himself photographed in front of the empty german pavilion for his " biennale venezia 1996 " poster . now visitors to the biennale can look forward to kippenberger 's phantasmal global underground metro-net project , conceived a few years before his death , to offer 20 seconds of relief from sizzling venetian summer temperatures above 40 c -lrb- 104 f -rrb- .
a subway grate has been installed in the floor of the german pavilion and every five minutes the sound of a train passing and a burst of cool air emanates from it .
kippenberger 's plan was to link the whole world with subway entrances , exits and ventilation grates that led nowhere .
he installed his first entrance in syros , greece in 1993 and planted additional evidence in dawson city , canada and münster , germany . empty rooms in sharp contrast to kippenberger 's virtual subway network , photographer candida höfer focuses on bleak pictures of public rooms devoid of any human presence . " the idea to combine our works appealed to me and i like what came of it , " photographer höfer , told the news agency dpa . born in eberswalde in 1944 , höfer is one of the most important representatives of the bernd and hilla becher school , a german couple , who have had a vast influence on documentary photography and passed on their unique style to scores of students at the düsseldorf art academy . for the biennale , heynen and höfer selected around two dozen photographs of rooms devoid of people , concert halls , libraries , cafés , sport halls and waiting rooms . " i think that because the people are n't visible they are much more recognizable .
you see that the rooms are made for people .
even when you do n't see them , they are there , " höfer told the kölner stadt-anzeiger , her local newspaper at home in cologne . but kippenberger and höfer are not the only german artists in venice .
theater director and perhaps germany 's most famous provocateur christoph schlingensief has positioned seven people " without jobs , homes or religions " as motionless pillars at the entrance to the giardini , where the country pavilions are .
their t-shirts say " church of fear . "
there they are meant to demonstrate their fears , the berlin director has said . art critics doubt though that this year 's german contribution will receive the attention that it did last time around , in 2001 .
then gregor schneider had rooms from his childhood house in rheydt , germany - from the bathroom sink to the electrical wires - moved to venice and installed in the pavilion , which was built in 1938 .
his work won the golden lion as the best of the 65 country contributions . controversy over nefertiti bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen nefertiti 's bronze body .
berlin got a taste of what the biennale might bring last week .
the hungarian art duo " little warsaw , " who will be part of the main exhibition in venice , " dreams and conflicts ; the dictatorship of the viewer , " cast a scantily clad female body in bronze , designed to fit the famous bust of queen nefertiti at berlin 's egyptian museum .
with the permission of the museum , they filmed the more than 3,000-year-old bust mounted on the body in late may to show later at the exhibition in venice . museum director dietrich wildung was subsequently accused of desecrating nefertiti by egyptian officials , who have demanded the sculpture be returned to cairo .
" nefertiti is not in safe hands in berlin , " sahi hawas , the head of the egyptian antiquities department , told the press on june 8 .
hawas and egyptian culture minister faruk husni also took offense to the sculpture 's near nakedness . wildung dismissed the calls for nefertiti 's return .
" that happens every year , " he said .
german archeologists unearthed the bust in 1912 and legally claimed it for germany . the venice biennale will be open until november 2 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the venice biennale web site 9797 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the green party , german chancellor schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , has given solid support to the chancellor ’ s controversial package of social and economic reforms at a special party conference . chancellor schröder ’ s bold attempts to overhaul germany ’ s overburdened social security system and rigid labor market found further acceptance on sunday with green party voting overwhelmingly in favor of his reform course .
at the end of a two-day special party conference in cottbus , more than 90 percent of the 700 delegates threw their weight behind the controversial reform package known as " agenda 2010 " unveiled by the chancellor in march this year .
the move follows a similar show of support by the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- earlier this month .
the reform package , which has drawn ire from both left-wingers and traditionalists in the spd and greens in recent months , includes capping the amount and duration of unemployment benefits , melding unemployment benefits and welfare benefits into one monthly check , streamlining the health care system and making it easier for german employers to hire and fire people .
" a new perspective for red-green " the green party leadership urged party delegates during the conference to back the much-needed reforms , which are needed to shake germany out of its economic slump and tackle unemployment , and warned that a failure to do so could threaten the coexistence of the spd-green government .
party head reinhard bütikofer said it was a core concern of the greens not to leave a heavily indebted nation to the next generation and that reforming the generous social system was a matter of survival for the coalition .
" " if red-green manage to get a grip on the reforms , then we can even change the mood in the country , " bütikofer said in a reference to the general pessimistic outlook in germany on account of a near-stagnant economy .
the green party ’ s most prominent member and germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer characterized the reform vote as an acid test for green beliefs and principles .
" it ’ s a question of whether we manage to carry through the reforms on our own , instead of leaving it to the right of center parties , " he said .
fischer emphasized the implementation of reforms wasn ’ t just meant for the country , but also to give " a new perspective to red-green . "
critics say reform package socially unfair but despite broad support for the reformist agenda within the greens , several critics within the party have once again voiced fears the reform plans are socially unfair and aren ’ t suitable for solving pressing problems plaguing the country .
green economics expert werner schulz lambasted the chancellor ’ s plans , saying it didn ’ t solve the structural problems , but " rather burdened the weak in a one-sided way with reform costs . "
several left-wingers also criticized " agenda 2010 " as socially unbalanced and a betrayal of basic party principles .
in particular the chancellor ’ s health care reforms which include charging more to patients for prescription drugs in an effort to control spiraling costs have come in for much flak .
in addition , a left-wing base is also renewing its demand for the implementation of the wealth tax , which foresees levying a one percent tax on more prosperous companies and individuals , and managed to push it through with a majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor 's party gives hearty support to reform course chancellor gerhard schröder received stronger-than-awaited backing from his party for a radical reform package that experts say is needed to shake germany out of its economic slump .

amid speculation the u.s. might drastically reduce its troops and their families based in germany , the mayors of 13 german cities that host american bases traveled to washington to plead the personnel be allowed to stay . the u.s. state department is currently reviewing the future of its many u.s. military bases around the world .
in the next few months , it is expected to announce major changes , which could include major cuts to the 70,000 u.s. troops and their families based in germany .
according to a report in the wall street journal , the pentagon wants to pull out 75 percent of u.s. troops from germany over the next few years .
many are to be deployed to countries like poland , hungary or romania , without their families , for six month rotational posts .
the pentagon argues the move will save much money and also allow the forces to be much closer to where they ’ re needed .
german mayors : troop withdrawal will be disastrous but the decision is proving to be a nightmare for the mayors of 13 german cities and towns , which host large american bases .
they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .
that ’ s worth sixty jobs over 20 years .
these kind of things really add up , and will be a major upheaval if the troops pack up and leave , " he told deutsche welle .
u.s. troops well-integrated into german society to make their point , the 13 traveled to washington this week to personally explain to the pentagon , the u.s. state department and even congress that germany is a safe and pleasant home for u.s. troops .
helmut wächter , the mayor of grafenwöhr in bavaria , told deutsche welle he returned feeling somewhat better than when he left .
" our message came across in all of our discussions .
some of those who spoke on our behalf are also based in germany , and through their own experiences , know about , and understand , the special relationships that are formed .
and of course , they will try to convey this message so that washington can take these issues into consideration . "
mayor wächter ’ s sentiments were confirmed by u.s. brigadier-general erwin lessel based in kaiserlautern which is home to 40,000 u.s. troops and their families .
brigadier-general lessel said the troops liked it there and added many of them have become close friends with their german neighbours .
reduction of forces still unclear mayor deubig of kaiserslautern said he expects u.s. forces will be asked to leave germany , but doubts that the figure of 75 percent is accurate .
" that figure has not been confirmed .
but it ’ s been made clear that the discussion is focussed on a reduction of large numbers of u.s. troops . "
the cuts could be interpreted as a rebuke to germany ’ s anti-war stance .
but experts note that the pentagon can ’ t shrink size of its forces in europe too much without risking its status within nato – the north atlantic treaty organization .
the final numbers are expected to be announced in a few months – troop withdrawal could follow as soon as one year later . wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .
that ’ s worth sixty jobs over 20 years .
these kind of things really add up , and will be a major upheaval if the troops pack up and leave , " he told deutsche welle .
u.s. troops well-integrated into german society to make their point , the 13 traveled to washington this week to personally explain to the pentagon , the u.s. state department and even congress that germany is a safe and pleasant home for u.s. troops .
helmut wächter , the mayor of grafenwöhr in bavaria , told deutsche welle he returned feeling somewhat better than when he left .
" our message came across in all of our discussions .
some of those who spoke on our behalf are also based in germany , and through their own experiences , know about , and understand , the special relationships that are formed .
and of course , they will try to convey this message so that washington can take these issues into consideration . "
mayor wächter ’ s sentiments were confirmed by u.s. brigadier-general erwin lessel based in kaiserlautern which is home to 40,000 u.s. troops and their families .
brigadier-general lessel said the troops liked it there and added many of them have become close friends with their german neighbours .
reduction of forces still unclear mayor deubig of kaiserslautern said he expects u.s. forces will be asked to leave germany , but doubts that the figure of 75 percent is accurate .
" that figure has not been confirmed .
but it ’ s been made clear that the discussion is focussed on a reduction of large numbers of u.s. troops . "
the cuts could be interpreted as a rebuke to germany ’ s anti-war stance .
but experts note that the pentagon can ’ t shrink size of its forces in europe too much without risking its status within nato – the north atlantic treaty organization .
the final numbers are expected to be announced in a few months – troop withdrawal could follow as soon as one year later . wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

martin kippenberger and candida höfer are germany 's representatives at the venice biennale , one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions which opens on sunday in the lagoon city . german curator julian heynen calls the exhibit in the german pavilion at this year 's venice biennale " topography . "
many an art critic has been inclined to scratch his head in confusion over the selection of two vastly different artists for this year 's german showing at the biennale - martin kippenberger who died in 1997 and was a controversial figure in the art world during his lifetime and the cool and severe candida höfer . like the biennale which opens for the 50th time on sunday , martin kippenberger would have been 50 this year too .
he always wanted to be invited to the venice biennale .
again and again the conceptual artist stressed that the only things that would make him go to the city of lagoons were the biennale and his own honeymoon . in the end the controversial artist made it for both occasions , but only the honeymoon took place during his lifetime , just a year before his death in 1997 .
it was an off year , when the exhibition was n't taking place .
kippenberger had himself photographed in front of the empty german pavilion for his " biennale venezia 1996 " poster . now visitors to the biennale can look forward to kippenberger 's phantasmal global underground metro-net project , conceived a few years before his death , to offer 20 seconds of relief from sizzling venetian summer temperatures above 40 c -lrb- 104 f -rrb- .
a subway grate has been installed in the floor of the german pavilion and every five minutes the sound of a train passing and a burst of cool air emanates from it .
kippenberger 's plan was to link the whole world with subway entrances , exits and ventilation grates that led nowhere .
he installed his first entrance in syros , greece in 1993 and planted additional evidence in dawson city , canada and münster , germany . empty rooms in sharp contrast to kippenberger 's virtual subway network , photographer candida höfer focuses on bleak pictures of public rooms devoid of any human presence . " the idea to combine our works appealed to me and i like what came of it , " photographer höfer , told the news agency dpa . born in eberswalde in 1944 , höfer is one of the most important representatives of the bernd and hilla becher school , a german couple , who have had a vast influence on documentary photography and passed on their unique style to scores of students at the düsseldorf art academy . for the biennale , heynen and höfer selected around two dozen photographs of rooms devoid of people , concert halls , libraries , cafés , sport halls and waiting rooms . " i think that because the people are n't visible they are much more recognizable .
you see that the rooms are made for people .
even when you do n't see them , they are there , " höfer told the kölner stadt-anzeiger , her local newspaper at home in cologne . but kippenberger and höfer are not the only german artists in venice .
theater director and perhaps germany 's most famous provocateur christoph schlingensief has positioned seven people " without jobs , homes or religions " as motionless pillars at the entrance to the giardini , where the country pavilions are .
their t-shirts say " church of fear . "
there they are meant to demonstrate their fears , the berlin director has said . art critics doubt though that this year 's german contribution will receive the attention that it did last time around , in 2001 .
then gregor schneider had rooms from his childhood house in rheydt , germany - from the bathroom sink to the electrical wires - moved to venice and installed in the pavilion , which was built in 1938 .

with the permission of the museum , they filmed the more than 3,000-year-old bust mounted on the body in late may to show later at the exhibition in venice . museum director dietrich wildung was subsequently accused of desecrating nefertiti by egyptian officials , who have demanded the sculpture be returned to cairo .
" nefertiti is not in safe hands in berlin , " sahi hawas , the head of the egyptian antiquities department , told the press on june 8 .

martin kippenberger and candida höfer are germany 's representatives at the venice biennale , one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions which opens on sunday in the lagoon city . german curator julian heynen calls the exhibit in the german pavilion at this year 's venice biennale " topography . "
many an art critic has been inclined to scratch his head in confusion over the selection of two vastly different artists for this year 's german showing at the biennale - martin kippenberger who died in 1997 and was a controversial figure in the art world during his lifetime and the cool and severe candida höfer . like the biennale which opens for the 50th time on sunday , martin kippenberger would have been 50 this year too .
he always wanted to be invited to the venice biennale .
again and again the conceptual artist stressed that the only things that would make him go to the city of lagoons were the biennale and his own honeymoon . in the end the controversial artist made it for both occasions , but only the honeymoon took place during his lifetime , just a year before his death in 1997 .
it was an off year , when the exhibition was n't taking place .
kippenberger had himself photographed in front of the empty german pavilion for his " biennale venezia 1996 " poster . now visitors to the biennale can look forward to kippenberger 's phantasmal global underground metro-net project , conceived a few years before his death , to offer 20 seconds of relief from sizzling venetian summer temperatures above 40 c -lrb- 104 f -rrb- .
a subway grate has been installed in the floor of the german pavilion and every five minutes the sound of a train passing and a burst of cool air emanates from it .
kippenberger 's plan was to link the whole world with subway entrances , exits and ventilation grates that led nowhere .
he installed his first entrance in syros , greece in 1993 and planted additional evidence in dawson city , canada and münster , germany . empty rooms in sharp contrast to kippenberger 's virtual subway network , photographer candida höfer focuses on bleak pictures of public rooms devoid of any human presence . " the idea to combine our works appealed to me and i like what came of it , " photographer höfer , told the news agency dpa . born in eberswalde in 1944 , höfer is one of the most important representatives of the bernd and hilla becher school , a german couple , who have had a vast influence on documentary photography and passed on their unique style to scores of students at the düsseldorf art academy . for the biennale , heynen and höfer selected around two dozen photographs of rooms devoid of people , concert halls , libraries , cafés , sport halls and waiting rooms . " i think that because the people are n't visible they are much more recognizable .
you see that the rooms are made for people .
even when you do n't see them , they are there , " höfer told the kölner stadt-anzeiger , her local newspaper at home in cologne . but kippenberger and höfer are not the only german artists in venice .
theater director and perhaps germany 's most famous provocateur christoph schlingensief has positioned seven people " without jobs , homes or religions " as motionless pillars at the entrance to the giardini , where the country pavilions are .
their t-shirts say " church of fear . "
there they are meant to demonstrate their fears , the berlin director has said . art critics doubt though that this year 's german contribution will receive the attention that it did last time around , in 2001 .
then gregor schneider had rooms from his childhood house in rheydt , germany - from the bathroom sink to the electrical wires - moved to venice and installed in the pavilion , which was built in 1938 .
his work won the golden lion as the best of the 65 country contributions . controversy over nefertiti bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen nefertiti 's bronze body .
berlin got a taste of what the biennale might bring last week .
the hungarian art duo " little warsaw , " who will be part of the main exhibition in venice , " dreams and conflicts ; the dictatorship of the viewer , " cast a scantily clad female body in bronze , designed to fit the famous bust of queen nefertiti at berlin 's egyptian museum .
with the permission of the museum , they filmed the more than 3,000-year-old bust mounted on the body in late may to show later at the exhibition in venice . museum director dietrich wildung was subsequently accused of desecrating nefertiti by egyptian officials , who have demanded the sculpture be returned to cairo .
" nefertiti is not in safe hands in berlin , " sahi hawas , the head of the egyptian antiquities department , told the press on june 8 .
hawas and egyptian culture minister faruk husni also took offense to the sculpture 's near nakedness . wildung dismissed the calls for nefertiti 's return .

amid speculation the u.s. might drastically reduce its troops and their families based in germany , the mayors of 13 german cities that host american bases traveled to washington to plead the personnel be allowed to stay . the u.s. state department is currently reviewing the future of its many u.s. military bases around the world .
in the next few months , it is expected to announce major changes , which could include major cuts to the 70,000 u.s. troops and their families based in germany .
according to a report in the wall street journal , the pentagon wants to pull out 75 percent of u.s. troops from germany over the next few years .
many are to be deployed to countries like poland , hungary or romania , without their families , for six month rotational posts .
the pentagon argues the move will save much money and also allow the forces to be much closer to where they ’ re needed .
german mayors : troop withdrawal will be disastrous but the decision is proving to be a nightmare for the mayors of 13 german cities and towns , which host large american bases .
they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .
that ’ s worth sixty jobs over 20 years .
these kind of things really add up , and will be a major upheaval if the troops pack up and leave , " he told deutsche welle .
u.s. troops well-integrated into german society to make their point , the 13 traveled to washington this week to personally explain to the pentagon , the u.s. state department and even congress that germany is a safe and pleasant home for u.s. troops .
helmut wächter , the mayor of grafenwöhr in bavaria , told deutsche welle he returned feeling somewhat better than when he left .
" our message came across in all of our discussions .
some of those who spoke on our behalf are also based in germany , and through their own experiences , know about , and understand , the special relationships that are formed .
and of course , they will try to convey this message so that washington can take these issues into consideration . "
mayor wächter ’ s sentiments were confirmed by u.s. brigadier-general erwin lessel based in kaiserlautern which is home to 40,000 u.s. troops and their families .
brigadier-general lessel said the troops liked it there and added many of them have become close friends with their german neighbours .
reduction of forces still unclear mayor deubig of kaiserslautern said he expects u.s. forces will be asked to leave germany , but doubts that the figure of 75 percent is accurate .
" that figure has not been confirmed .
but it ’ s been made clear that the discussion is focussed on a reduction of large numbers of u.s. troops . "
the cuts could be interpreted as a rebuke to germany ’ s anti-war stance .
but experts note that the pentagon can ’ t shrink size of its forces in europe too much without risking its status within nato – the north atlantic treaty organization .
the final numbers are expected to be announced in a few months – troop withdrawal could follow as soon as one year later . wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.06.2003 greens back chancellor schröder 's reformist agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister and green member joschka fischer urges delegates to support reforms .
the green party , german chancellor schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , has given solid support to the chancellor ’ s controversial package of social and economic reforms at a special party conference . chancellor schröder ’ s bold attempts to overhaul germany ’ s overburdened social security system and rigid labor market found further acceptance on sunday with green party voting overwhelmingly in favor of his reform course .
at the end of a two-day special party conference in cottbus , more than 90 percent of the 700 delegates threw their weight behind the controversial reform package known as " agenda 2010 " unveiled by the chancellor in march this year .
the move follows a similar show of support by the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- earlier this month .
the reform package , which has drawn ire from both left-wingers and traditionalists in the spd and greens in recent months , includes capping the amount and duration of unemployment benefits , melding unemployment benefits and welfare benefits into one monthly check , streamlining the health care system and making it easier for german employers to hire and fire people .
" a new perspective for red-green " the green party leadership urged party delegates during the conference to back the much-needed reforms , which are needed to shake germany out of its economic slump and tackle unemployment , and warned that a failure to do so could threaten the coexistence of the spd-green government .
party head reinhard bütikofer said it was a core concern of the greens not to leave a heavily indebted nation to the next generation and that reforming the generous social system was a matter of survival for the coalition .
" " if red-green manage to get a grip on the reforms , then we can even change the mood in the country , " bütikofer said in a reference to the general pessimistic outlook in germany on account of a near-stagnant economy .
the green party ’ s most prominent member and germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer characterized the reform vote as an acid test for green beliefs and principles .
" it ’ s a question of whether we manage to carry through the reforms on our own , instead of leaving it to the right of center parties , " he said .
fischer emphasized the implementation of reforms wasn ’ t just meant for the country , but also to give " a new perspective to red-green . "
critics say reform package socially unfair but despite broad support for the reformist agenda within the greens , several critics within the party have once again voiced fears the reform plans are socially unfair and aren ’ t suitable for solving pressing problems plaguing the country .
green economics expert werner schulz lambasted the chancellor ’ s plans , saying it didn ’ t solve the structural problems , but " rather burdened the weak in a one-sided way with reform costs . "
several left-wingers also criticized " agenda 2010 " as socially unbalanced and a betrayal of basic party principles .

the green party , german chancellor schröder ’ s junior coalition partner , has given solid support to the chancellor ’ s controversial package of social and economic reforms at a special party conference . chancellor schröder ’ s bold attempts to overhaul germany ’ s overburdened social security system and rigid labor market found further acceptance on sunday with green party voting overwhelmingly in favor of his reform course .
at the end of a two-day special party conference in cottbus , more than 90 percent of the 700 delegates threw their weight behind the controversial reform package known as " agenda 2010 " unveiled by the chancellor in march this year .
the move follows a similar show of support by the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- earlier this month .
the reform package , which has drawn ire from both left-wingers and traditionalists in the spd and greens in recent months , includes capping the amount and duration of unemployment benefits , melding unemployment benefits and welfare benefits into one monthly check , streamlining the health care system and making it easier for german employers to hire and fire people .
" a new perspective for red-green " the green party leadership urged party delegates during the conference to back the much-needed reforms , which are needed to shake germany out of its economic slump and tackle unemployment , and warned that a failure to do so could threaten the coexistence of the spd-green government .
party head reinhard bütikofer said it was a core concern of the greens not to leave a heavily indebted nation to the next generation and that reforming the generous social system was a matter of survival for the coalition .
" " if red-green manage to get a grip on the reforms , then we can even change the mood in the country , " bütikofer said in a reference to the general pessimistic outlook in germany on account of a near-stagnant economy .
the green party ’ s most prominent member and germany ’ s foreign minister joschka fischer characterized the reform vote as an acid test for green beliefs and principles .
" it ’ s a question of whether we manage to carry through the reforms on our own , instead of leaving it to the right of center parties , " he said .
fischer emphasized the implementation of reforms wasn ’ t just meant for the country , but also to give " a new perspective to red-green . "
critics say reform package socially unfair but despite broad support for the reformist agenda within the greens , several critics within the party have once again voiced fears the reform plans are socially unfair and aren ’ t suitable for solving pressing problems plaguing the country .
green economics expert werner schulz lambasted the chancellor ’ s plans , saying it didn ’ t solve the structural problems , but " rather burdened the weak in a one-sided way with reform costs . "
several left-wingers also criticized " agenda 2010 " as socially unbalanced and a betrayal of basic party principles .

amid speculation the u.s. might drastically reduce its troops and their families based in germany , the mayors of 13 german cities that host american bases traveled to washington to plead the personnel be allowed to stay . the u.s. state department is currently reviewing the future of its many u.s. military bases around the world .
in the next few months , it is expected to announce major changes , which could include major cuts to the 70,000 u.s. troops and their families based in germany .
according to a report in the wall street journal , the pentagon wants to pull out 75 percent of u.s. troops from germany over the next few years .
many are to be deployed to countries like poland , hungary or romania , without their families , for six month rotational posts .
the pentagon argues the move will save much money and also allow the forces to be much closer to where they ’ re needed .
german mayors : troop withdrawal will be disastrous but the decision is proving to be a nightmare for the mayors of 13 german cities and towns , which host large american bases .
they argue the pulling out of american troops , originally stationed there after the second world war as one of the occupying powers , will have major social and economic repercussions in germany .
the mayor of kaiserslautern bernhard deubig , for example , says his city will lose one billion u.s. dollars in revenue per year alone should the troops leave .
" just last october , we signed a contract to supply u.s. troops with energy worth 200 million dollars a year .
that ’ s worth sixty jobs over 20 years .
these kind of things really add up , and will be a major upheaval if the troops pack up and leave , " he told deutsche welle .
u.s. troops well-integrated into german society to make their point , the 13 traveled to washington this week to personally explain to the pentagon , the u.s. state department and even congress that germany is a safe and pleasant home for u.s. troops .
helmut wächter , the mayor of grafenwöhr in bavaria , told deutsche welle he returned feeling somewhat better than when he left .
" our message came across in all of our discussions .
some of those who spoke on our behalf are also based in germany , and through their own experiences , know about , and understand , the special relationships that are formed .
and of course , they will try to convey this message so that washington can take these issues into consideration . "
mayor wächter ’ s sentiments were confirmed by u.s. brigadier-general erwin lessel based in kaiserlautern which is home to 40,000 u.s. troops and their families .
brigadier-general lessel said the troops liked it there and added many of them have become close friends with their german neighbours .
reduction of forces still unclear mayor deubig of kaiserslautern said he expects u.s. forces will be asked to leave germany , but doubts that the figure of 75 percent is accurate .
" that figure has not been confirmed .
but it ’ s been made clear that the discussion is focussed on a reduction of large numbers of u.s. troops . "
the cuts could be interpreted as a rebuke to germany ’ s anti-war stance .
but experts note that the pentagon can ’ t shrink size of its forces in europe too much without risking its status within nato – the north atlantic treaty organization .
the final numbers are expected to be announced in a few months – troop withdrawal could follow as soon as one year later . wilhelmina lyffyt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

martin kippenberger and candida höfer are germany 's representatives at the venice biennale , one of the world 's most important contemporary art exhibitions which opens on sunday in the lagoon city . german curator julian heynen calls the exhibit in the german pavilion at this year 's venice biennale " topography . "
many an art critic has been inclined to scratch his head in confusion over the selection of two vastly different artists for this year 's german showing at the biennale - martin kippenberger who died in 1997 and was a controversial figure in the art world during his lifetime and the cool and severe candida höfer . like the biennale which opens for the 50th time on sunday , martin kippenberger would have been 50 this year too .
he always wanted to be invited to the venice biennale .
again and again the conceptual artist stressed that the only things that would make him go to the city of lagoons were the biennale and his own honeymoon . in the end the controversial artist made it for both occasions , but only the honeymoon took place during his lifetime , just a year before his death in 1997 .
it was an off year , when the exhibition was n't taking place .
kippenberger had himself photographed in front of the empty german pavilion for his " biennale venezia 1996 " poster . now visitors to the biennale can look forward to kippenberger 's phantasmal global underground metro-net project , conceived a few years before his death , to offer 20 seconds of relief from sizzling venetian summer temperatures above 40 c -lrb- 104 f -rrb- .
a subway grate has been installed in the floor of the german pavilion and every five minutes the sound of a train passing and a burst of cool air emanates from it .
kippenberger 's plan was to link the whole world with subway entrances , exits and ventilation grates that led nowhere .
he installed his first entrance in syros , greece in 1993 and planted additional evidence in dawson city , canada and münster , germany . empty rooms in sharp contrast to kippenberger 's virtual subway network , photographer candida höfer focuses on bleak pictures of public rooms devoid of any human presence . " the idea to combine our works appealed to me and i like what came of it , " photographer höfer , told the news agency dpa . born in eberswalde in 1944 , höfer is one of the most important representatives of the bernd and hilla becher school , a german couple , who have had a vast influence on documentary photography and passed on their unique style to scores of students at the düsseldorf art academy . for the biennale , heynen and höfer selected around two dozen photographs of rooms devoid of people , concert halls , libraries , cafés , sport halls and waiting rooms . " i think that because the people are n't visible they are much more recognizable .
you see that the rooms are made for people .
even when you do n't see them , they are there , " höfer told the kölner stadt-anzeiger , her local newspaper at home in cologne . but kippenberger and höfer are not the only german artists in venice .
theater director and perhaps germany 's most famous provocateur christoph schlingensief has positioned seven people " without jobs , homes or religions " as motionless pillars at the entrance to the giardini , where the country pavilions are .
their t-shirts say " church of fear . "
there they are meant to demonstrate their fears , the berlin director has said . art critics doubt though that this year 's german contribution will receive the attention that it did last time around , in 2001 .
then gregor schneider had rooms from his childhood house in rheydt , germany - from the bathroom sink to the electrical wires - moved to venice and installed in the pavilion , which was built in 1938 .
his work won the golden lion as the best of the 65 country contributions . controversy over nefertiti bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen nefertiti 's bronze body .
berlin got a taste of what the biennale might bring last week .
the hungarian art duo " little warsaw , " who will be part of the main exhibition in venice , " dreams and conflicts ; the dictatorship of the viewer , " cast a scantily clad female body in bronze , designed to fit the famous bust of queen nefertiti at berlin 's egyptian museum .
with the permission of the museum , they filmed the more than 3,000-year-old bust mounted on the body in late may to show later at the exhibition in venice . museum director dietrich wildung was subsequently accused of desecrating nefertiti by egyptian officials , who have demanded the sculpture be returned to cairo .
" nefertiti is not in safe hands in berlin , " sahi hawas , the head of the egyptian antiquities department , told the press on june 8 .
hawas and egyptian culture minister faruk husni also took offense to the sculpture 's near nakedness . wildung dismissed the calls for nefertiti 's return .

the building , electric pink until it was painted red for comic relief , is at the centre of a 170-acre area in south london being transformed in a £ 1.5bn public private partnership scheme .
many will be glad to see the back of the 1960s building and the traffic-choked six-lane roundabout on which it sits .
" there used to be polls about which the most hated building was and we used to be right up there with the park lane hilton , " said chris horn , regeneration project director .
now the area , including five 12-storey post-war council blocks , are to be demolished and the whole road system re-arranged over the next 12 years .
marking the first phase of the development is the building of about 1,000 new homes for council tenants and private owners .
a three-month public consultation process is underway the transformation can not come soon enough for mr horn , who believes the old layout has stifled the area 's development .
elephant and castle has good transport links , is close to the city and the west end and is within walking distance of 11 thames river crossings .
but , he says , locals leave the area to do much of their shopping in croydon , bluewater and the west end .
he is not a fan of the bright red shopping centre either .
he told bbc news online : " it thrives inside with little local businesses but it is not anybody 's idea of a modern shopping centre .
" its crumbling exterior has become a symbol of the deterioration of elephant and castle . "
it is hoped the new plans for a new , partly pedestrianised town centre , packed with cafés , restaurants and shops , parks and leisure facilities as well as over 4,000 homes will win over residents .
they are being consulted on the proposals for the next three months before southwark council confirms the final shape of the future elephant and castle in september .
at the shopping centre , it appears the massive project has been talked about for so long - people do not believe it will really happen .
i would sooner see it stop like it is ernest spring , 74 one young stallholder said ; " i feel i will be long gone into retirement by the time they pull it down .
" when i first arrived seven years ago , someone told me they were going to pull it down in six months .
" last week i heard it would be five years - to me that means eight to 10 years .
that 's why people are not really worried about it . "
pensioners ernest and emily spring , from battersea , do their shopping and play bingo at the shopping centre once a week .
" i would sooner see it stop like it is , all the shops are here already , " said mr spring , 74 .
" we 're not only coming for the shopping , but we come in and have a walk around they 've got a market outside , it 's very convenient . "
and there is concern wooing big chains will mean moving existing small businesses out of the centre .
but mr horn believes the facelift will not only benefit elephant and castle , but the rest of london , where there are few large plots of land available for regeneration .
" we are part of a city - london has a status as a great city and we can contribute to that , " he said .
