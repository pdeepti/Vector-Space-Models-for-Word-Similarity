subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .
that makes him a hero figure to me .

nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .
german defense minister struck also discussed expanding the military presence beyond kabul . following the fall of the taliban , foreign troops have been in the afghan capital kabul as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- since january 2002 .
the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .
" afghanistan must not lapse back into anarchy or chaos .
afghanistan must not again become the home of global terror as was the case under the rule of the taliban . " lawless countryside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai karzai has long pleaded with the west to increase its engagement in the country beyond the relatively safe borders of kabul .
much of the country remains dangerously lawless and the u.s. military continues operations to hunt the remnants of the taliban or al qaeda . but those present dangers are exactly why germany 's conservative opposition is hesitant to put german forces in potentially deadly situations outside of kabul .
in june , four german soldiers died and 29 were injured after a suicide attack on a isaf bus . " to say already that we 'll definitely send soldiers into the countryside that we are n't familiar with and do n't know how we 'll be received is , in my opinion , irresponsible , " christian democrat military expert thomas kossendey told german ard television on monday . the german parliament will have to approve any expansion of the military 's mandate in afghanistan , which could spell trouble for the government since the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens only has a razor-thin majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato general faces challenges in afghanistan as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces -lrb- aug .

as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .

as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .
in addition , the germans , on account of their intense involvement in rebuilding postwar afghanistan both on a civil and military level , enjoy a good reputation with the general public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .
german defense minister struck also discussed expanding the military presence beyond kabul . following the fall of the taliban , foreign troops have been in the afghan capital kabul as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- since january 2002 .
the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .
" afghanistan must not lapse back into anarchy or chaos .
afghanistan must not again become the home of global terror as was the case under the rule of the taliban . " lawless countryside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai karzai has long pleaded with the west to increase its engagement in the country beyond the relatively safe borders of kabul .
much of the country remains dangerously lawless and the u.s. military continues operations to hunt the remnants of the taliban or al qaeda . but those present dangers are exactly why germany 's conservative opposition is hesitant to put german forces in potentially deadly situations outside of kabul .
in june , four german soldiers died and 29 were injured after a suicide attack on a isaf bus . " to say already that we 'll definitely send soldiers into the countryside that we are n't familiar with and do n't know how we 'll be received is , in my opinion , irresponsible , " christian democrat military expert thomas kossendey told german ard television on monday . the german parliament will have to approve any expansion of the military 's mandate in afghanistan , which could spell trouble for the government since the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens only has a razor-thin majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato general faces challenges in afghanistan as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces -lrb- aug .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .

the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .

as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .
in addition , the germans , on account of their intense involvement in rebuilding postwar afghanistan both on a civil and military level , enjoy a good reputation with the general public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .
german defense minister struck also discussed expanding the military presence beyond kabul . following the fall of the taliban , foreign troops have been in the afghan capital kabul as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- since january 2002 .
the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .
" afghanistan must not lapse back into anarchy or chaos .
afghanistan must not again become the home of global terror as was the case under the rule of the taliban . " lawless countryside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai karzai has long pleaded with the west to increase its engagement in the country beyond the relatively safe borders of kabul .

nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .
german defense minister struck also discussed expanding the military presence beyond kabul . following the fall of the taliban , foreign troops have been in the afghan capital kabul as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- since january 2002 .
the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.08.2003 nato general faces challenges in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man in charge - nato general götz gliemeroth salutes after arriving in kabul .
as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .
in addition , the germans , on account of their intense involvement in rebuilding postwar afghanistan both on a civil and military level , enjoy a good reputation with the general public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .

u.s. stock exchange nasdaq opened a german bourse amid much fanfare only four months ago .
but as the outlook for equities remains bleak , nasdaq appears prepared to pull the plug on the new exchange before year ’ s end . in march , america ’ s top high-tech stock exchange nasdaq joined forces with the regional berlin and bremen bourses as well as leading german banks dresdner bank and commerzbank to form what was intended to be a challenge to deutsche boerse ’ s dominance of the german equity market . but according to numerous media reports , the ongoing tough market conditions and less-than-expected turnover for the new exchange have made it clear to nasdaq that there is little future for it in germany . “ everybody in frankfurt is aware that the end is near for nasdaq deutschland , ” one investor in the project told die welt newspaper .
nasdaq deutschland has refused to comment on the speculation over its coming demise , but some observers believe a final decision to close the exchange could come as early as monday . tiny turnover when founded this spring , nasdaq deutschland had hoped to garner a market share of 15 percent by 2006 .
that would enable it to become a respectable number two in germany after the mighty frankfurt-based deutsche boerse .
since currently around 90 percent of all german equity business is done in frankfurt , the nasdaq exchange was seen as the best possible way to secure the future of the regional bourses in berlin and bremen . now only months later , nasdaq is apparently beating a hasty retreat back to american shores and the german exchange project is being left high and dry .
but not without good reason : nasdaq deutschland managed a trading volume of only € 148 million -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- for the entire month of june – an amount a single mid-sized stock on the frankfurt stock exchange easily manages in one day . the dire situation of the german exchange has been know for some time .
in july , john hilley , head of nasdaq international and on nasdaq deutschland ’ s supervisory board , was forced to resign . the likely decision to quit germany also comes after nasdaq announced in june it would shut down it ’ s nasdaq europe exchange headquartered in brussels by november .
the exchange ’ s operations in tokyo have also been mothballed .
but as nasdaq chooses to focus on its u.s. business , the german investors in the project could be left without a new partner to take the americans ’ place . although the group had reportedly been in talks with european rival euronext to buyout nasdaq ’ s 50 percent stake , few seem to think that went very far .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .
that makes him a hero figure to me .

u.s. stock exchange nasdaq opened a german bourse amid much fanfare only four months ago .
but as the outlook for equities remains bleak , nasdaq appears prepared to pull the plug on the new exchange before year ’ s end . in march , america ’ s top high-tech stock exchange nasdaq joined forces with the regional berlin and bremen bourses as well as leading german banks dresdner bank and commerzbank to form what was intended to be a challenge to deutsche boerse ’ s dominance of the german equity market . but according to numerous media reports , the ongoing tough market conditions and less-than-expected turnover for the new exchange have made it clear to nasdaq that there is little future for it in germany . “ everybody in frankfurt is aware that the end is near for nasdaq deutschland , ” one investor in the project told die welt newspaper .
nasdaq deutschland has refused to comment on the speculation over its coming demise , but some observers believe a final decision to close the exchange could come as early as monday . tiny turnover when founded this spring , nasdaq deutschland had hoped to garner a market share of 15 percent by 2006 .
that would enable it to become a respectable number two in germany after the mighty frankfurt-based deutsche boerse .
since currently around 90 percent of all german equity business is done in frankfurt , the nasdaq exchange was seen as the best possible way to secure the future of the regional bourses in berlin and bremen . now only months later , nasdaq is apparently beating a hasty retreat back to american shores and the german exchange project is being left high and dry .
but not without good reason : nasdaq deutschland managed a trading volume of only € 148 million -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- for the entire month of june – an amount a single mid-sized stock on the frankfurt stock exchange easily manages in one day . the dire situation of the german exchange has been know for some time .
in july , john hilley , head of nasdaq international and on nasdaq deutschland ’ s supervisory board , was forced to resign . the likely decision to quit germany also comes after nasdaq announced in june it would shut down it ’ s nasdaq europe exchange headquartered in brussels by november .
the exchange ’ s operations in tokyo have also been mothballed .
but as nasdaq chooses to focus on its u.s. business , the german investors in the project could be left without a new partner to take the americans ’ place . although the group had reportedly been in talks with european rival euronext to buyout nasdaq ’ s 50 percent stake , few seem to think that went very far .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .
that makes him a hero figure to me .

nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .
german defense minister struck also discussed expanding the military presence beyond kabul . following the fall of the taliban , foreign troops have been in the afghan capital kabul as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- since january 2002 .
the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .
" afghanistan must not lapse back into anarchy or chaos .
afghanistan must not again become the home of global terror as was the case under the rule of the taliban . " lawless countryside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai karzai has long pleaded with the west to increase its engagement in the country beyond the relatively safe borders of kabul .
much of the country remains dangerously lawless and the u.s. military continues operations to hunt the remnants of the taliban or al qaeda . but those present dangers are exactly why germany 's conservative opposition is hesitant to put german forces in potentially deadly situations outside of kabul .
in june , four german soldiers died and 29 were injured after a suicide attack on a isaf bus . " to say already that we 'll definitely send soldiers into the countryside that we are n't familiar with and do n't know how we 'll be received is , in my opinion , irresponsible , " christian democrat military expert thomas kossendey told german ard television on monday . the german parliament will have to approve any expansion of the military 's mandate in afghanistan , which could spell trouble for the government since the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens only has a razor-thin majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato general faces challenges in afghanistan as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces -lrb- aug .

as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .

as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.08.2003 nato general faces challenges in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man in charge - nato general götz gliemeroth salutes after arriving in kabul .
as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .
in addition , the germans , on account of their intense involvement in rebuilding postwar afghanistan both on a civil and military level , enjoy a good reputation with the general public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .
german defense minister struck also discussed expanding the military presence beyond kabul . following the fall of the taliban , foreign troops have been in the afghan capital kabul as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- since january 2002 .
the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .
" afghanistan must not lapse back into anarchy or chaos .
afghanistan must not again become the home of global terror as was the case under the rule of the taliban . " lawless countryside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai karzai has long pleaded with the west to increase its engagement in the country beyond the relatively safe borders of kabul .
much of the country remains dangerously lawless and the u.s. military continues operations to hunt the remnants of the taliban or al qaeda . but those present dangers are exactly why germany 's conservative opposition is hesitant to put german forces in potentially deadly situations outside of kabul .
in june , four german soldiers died and 29 were injured after a suicide attack on a isaf bus . " to say already that we 'll definitely send soldiers into the countryside that we are n't familiar with and do n't know how we 'll be received is , in my opinion , irresponsible , " christian democrat military expert thomas kossendey told german ard television on monday . the german parliament will have to approve any expansion of the military 's mandate in afghanistan , which could spell trouble for the government since the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens only has a razor-thin majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato general faces challenges in afghanistan as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces -lrb- aug .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .
that makes him a hero figure to me .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .

vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .

nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .
german defense minister struck also discussed expanding the military presence beyond kabul . following the fall of the taliban , foreign troops have been in the afghan capital kabul as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- since january 2002 .
the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .
" afghanistan must not lapse back into anarchy or chaos .
afghanistan must not again become the home of global terror as was the case under the rule of the taliban . " lawless countryside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai karzai has long pleaded with the west to increase its engagement in the country beyond the relatively safe borders of kabul .
much of the country remains dangerously lawless and the u.s. military continues operations to hunt the remnants of the taliban or al qaeda . but those present dangers are exactly why germany 's conservative opposition is hesitant to put german forces in potentially deadly situations outside of kabul .
in june , four german soldiers died and 29 were injured after a suicide attack on a isaf bus . " to say already that we 'll definitely send soldiers into the countryside that we are n't familiar with and do n't know how we 'll be received is , in my opinion , irresponsible , " christian democrat military expert thomas kossendey told german ard television on monday . the german parliament will have to approve any expansion of the military 's mandate in afghanistan , which could spell trouble for the government since the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens only has a razor-thin majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato general faces challenges in afghanistan as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces -lrb- aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.08.2003 nato general faces challenges in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man in charge - nato general götz gliemeroth salutes after arriving in kabul .
as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .
in addition , the germans , on account of their intense involvement in rebuilding postwar afghanistan both on a civil and military level , enjoy a good reputation with the general public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .
in addition , the germans , on account of their intense involvement in rebuilding postwar afghanistan both on a civil and military level , enjoy a good reputation with the general public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .
in addition , the germans , on account of their intense involvement in rebuilding postwar afghanistan both on a civil and military level , enjoy a good reputation with the general public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .
german defense minister struck also discussed expanding the military presence beyond kabul . following the fall of the taliban , foreign troops have been in the afghan capital kabul as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- since january 2002 .
the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .
" afghanistan must not lapse back into anarchy or chaos .
afghanistan must not again become the home of global terror as was the case under the rule of the taliban . " lawless countryside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai karzai has long pleaded with the west to increase its engagement in the country beyond the relatively safe borders of kabul .
much of the country remains dangerously lawless and the u.s. military continues operations to hunt the remnants of the taliban or al qaeda . but those present dangers are exactly why germany 's conservative opposition is hesitant to put german forces in potentially deadly situations outside of kabul .
in june , four german soldiers died and 29 were injured after a suicide attack on a isaf bus . " to say already that we 'll definitely send soldiers into the countryside that we are n't familiar with and do n't know how we 'll be received is , in my opinion , irresponsible , " christian democrat military expert thomas kossendey told german ard television on monday . the german parliament will have to approve any expansion of the military 's mandate in afghanistan , which could spell trouble for the government since the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens only has a razor-thin majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato general faces challenges in afghanistan as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces -lrb- aug .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .
that makes him a hero figure to me .

nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .
german defense minister struck also discussed expanding the military presence beyond kabul . following the fall of the taliban , foreign troops have been in the afghan capital kabul as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- since january 2002 .
the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .
" afghanistan must not lapse back into anarchy or chaos .
afghanistan must not again become the home of global terror as was the case under the rule of the taliban .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .

as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.08.2003 nato general faces challenges in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man in charge - nato general götz gliemeroth salutes after arriving in kabul .
as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .

after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.08.2003 nato general faces challenges in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man in charge - nato general götz gliemeroth salutes after arriving in kabul .
as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .

as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .

nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .
german defense minister struck also discussed expanding the military presence beyond kabul . following the fall of the taliban , foreign troops have been in the afghan capital kabul as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- since january 2002 .
the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .
" afghanistan must not lapse back into anarchy or chaos .
afghanistan must not again become the home of global terror as was the case under the rule of the taliban . " lawless countryside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai karzai has long pleaded with the west to increase its engagement in the country beyond the relatively safe borders of kabul .
much of the country remains dangerously lawless and the u.s. military continues operations to hunt the remnants of the taliban or al qaeda . but those present dangers are exactly why germany 's conservative opposition is hesitant to put german forces in potentially deadly situations outside of kabul .
in june , four german soldiers died and 29 were injured after a suicide attack on a isaf bus . " to say already that we 'll definitely send soldiers into the countryside that we are n't familiar with and do n't know how we 'll be received is , in my opinion , irresponsible , " christian democrat military expert thomas kossendey told german ard television on monday . the german parliament will have to approve any expansion of the military 's mandate in afghanistan , which could spell trouble for the government since the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens only has a razor-thin majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato general faces challenges in afghanistan as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces -lrb- aug .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .
that makes him a hero figure to me .

as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .
in addition , the germans , on account of their intense involvement in rebuilding postwar afghanistan both on a civil and military level , enjoy a good reputation with the general public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself .

lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .

as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .
that makes him a hero figure to me .

the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .

much of the country remains dangerously lawless and the u.s. military continues operations to hunt the remnants of the taliban or al qaeda . but those present dangers are exactly why germany 's conservative opposition is hesitant to put german forces in potentially deadly situations outside of kabul .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .
that makes him a hero figure to me .

as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .
in addition , the germans , on account of their intense involvement in rebuilding postwar afghanistan both on a civil and military level , enjoy a good reputation with the general public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .
that makes him a hero figure to me .

nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .
german defense minister struck also discussed expanding the military presence beyond kabul . following the fall of the taliban , foreign troops have been in the afghan capital kabul as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- since january 2002 .
the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .

the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .

nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .
german defense minister struck also discussed expanding the military presence beyond kabul . following the fall of the taliban , foreign troops have been in the afghan capital kabul as part of the international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- since january 2002 .
the 5,000 strong peacekeeping force has helped afghanistan ’ s interim government stabilize the country as it attempts to rebuild after decades of war and conflict . since the isaf ’ s inception , the command has rotated every six months to different nations including britain , turkey and a joint operation of germany and the netherlands .
but now the north atlantic treaty organization has now taken up the reins on an open-ended basis . for nato it will be the first time in its more than 50 year history that the organization has embarked on a mission outside of europe , as it attempts to forge a new post-cold war role for itself . " it 's a milestone in nato 's development representing a real break from the nato of the past to an alliance which is more relevant and has greater utility in the uncertain security environment of the future , " said isaf operational commander general sir jack deverell in a statement . key german role although germany is handing the helm over to nato , a german general will remain in command of isaf .
lieutenant general götz gliemeroth from nato will relieve norbert van heyst who led the german-dutch mission the past half year . few countries have played such an important role in contributing to isaf as has germany .
building on historically strong ties between the two countries , germany has stationed around 2,500 troops in afghanistan , the largest contingent in the multi-nation operation .
that number will be reduced by 900 as nato takes over the command in the next few weeks , but at the same time germany has begun considering taking part in a vanguard expansion of isaf ’ s mission outside of kabul and the surrounding region . german defense minister peter struck planned to discuss the widening of isaf ’ s field of operations with afghan president hamid karzai after the ceremony transferring command to nato .
many observers expect that up to 300 german soldiers could be stationed in the northern city of kunduz to help stabilize the region as it is rebuilt . " there is still a lot to be done , " struck said at the ceremony according to the reuters news agency .
" afghanistan must not lapse back into anarchy or chaos .
afghanistan must not again become the home of global terror as was the case under the rule of the taliban . " lawless countryside bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamid karzai karzai has long pleaded with the west to increase its engagement in the country beyond the relatively safe borders of kabul .
much of the country remains dangerously lawless and the u.s. military continues operations to hunt the remnants of the taliban or al qaeda . but those present dangers are exactly why germany 's conservative opposition is hesitant to put german forces in potentially deadly situations outside of kabul .
in june , four german soldiers died and 29 were injured after a suicide attack on a isaf bus . " to say already that we 'll definitely send soldiers into the countryside that we are n't familiar with and do n't know how we 'll be received is , in my opinion , irresponsible , " christian democrat military expert thomas kossendey told german ard television on monday . the german parliament will have to approve any expansion of the military 's mandate in afghanistan , which could spell trouble for the government since the center-left coalition of social democrats and greens only has a razor-thin majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato general faces challenges in afghanistan as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces -lrb- aug .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .
that makes him a hero figure to me .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.08.2003 nato general faces challenges in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : man in charge - nato general götz gliemeroth salutes after arriving in kabul .
as nato takes over peacekeeping in afghanistan , its first such operation outside europe , deutsche welle takes a look at the alliance ’ s german three-star general götz gliemeroth , who will direct the forces . the security situation in afghanistan may still be far from certain , but for nato general götz gliemeroth , one thing is already clear – taking over the command of the multinational international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- is going to be a tough challenge .
as the leadership of the 5,000-strong peacekeeping force in afghanistan changes hands on monday when nato takes over the helm from joint german-dutch command , all eyes will be on general gliemeroth .
the 59-year-old faces the twin responsibility of leading nato into its first peacekeeping operation outside europe in its 54-year history as well as a possible expansion of isaf ’ s kabul operations into the more remote provinces , which are considered lawless and risky on account of factional rivalries and a resurgent taliban guerilla movement .
in an interview with deutsche welle , gliemeroth , a former lieutenant general in the german armed forces , underlined the fact that the situation in kabul is still " insecure . "
his aim , he said , was to ensure that every single man and woman returned home from afghanistan , safe and sound .
the general also highlighted the significance of nato ’ s involvement .
" it ’ s certainly a historic step for the alliance .
we all know it ’ s the first deployment of nato troops outside europe and north america . "
a steady climb to top military echelons the leadership of isaf , whose soldiers are drawn from 31 nations , marks a highpoint in gliemeroth ’ s military career .
previously a commander at the nato joint command center in heidelberg , gliemeroth was in charge of ground troops from central and eastern europe and is thus used to working in an international atmosphere .
the general said the troops in kabul are multinational in the true sense of the word .
" there ’ ll be 14 nato countries represented , and what ’ s perhaps even more conspicuous will be the troops from 17 countries , which aren ’ t members of nato . "
born on october 21 , 1943 in göttingen , gliemeroth ’ s career in the german army began at the age of 20 as a paratrooper .
two years later , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and deployed as a combat troops officer in hammelburg , munich and ellwangen .
after performing his duties as an officer with particular distinction , gliemeroth underwent commander training duties in hamburg and toronto in his mid-thirties and then transferred to nato high command to mönchengladbach near the german-dutch border .
for the next few years , gliemeroth alternated between administrative jobs in the defense ministry and commanding troop exercises in the field .
after being promoted to general in 1990 , he was placed in charge of army personnel .
gliemeroth ’ s peers have described him as open-minded , frank and eloquent .
he has a passion for sports , traveling as well as classical music .
he ’ s been reported as taking cd ’ s of mozart and brahms to kabul .
the posting in afghanistan is his last before he retires .
tough task made simpler " we expect to be there for six months .
that doesn ’ t change the fact that the alliance is introducing more continuity , since you ’ ve still got the planning capability and resource issues going on , " he said .
gliemeroth ’ s job in afghanistan involves supporting the interim afghan government in building democracy and improving internal security .
according to the agreements reached at the petersburg conference in december 2001 , isaf ’ s mandate also extends to raising and training afghan security forces as well as protecting united nations personnel based in kabul .
though the afghanistan mission is expected to be tough going for gliemeroth , a few facts already speak in his favor .
general gliemeroth ’ s origins – the fact that he is german – has a number of advantages : first , it makes the handover easier , because the troops have already been under german command for the past six months .
in addition , the germans , on account of their intense involvement in rebuilding postwar afghanistan both on a civil and military level , enjoy a good reputation with the general public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ? the residents of marquardt , a sleepy town near potsdam west of the german capital , were rubbing their eyes in disbelief last week .
an indian film crew had taken over the sprawling verdant grounds of their picturesque neo-baroque castle located on the banks of a lake .
vans full of technical equipment and costumes were parked in the driveway as technicians , actors and extra hands - both german and indian - hurried around barking instructions and calling out to each other in german , english and a handful of indian languages .
the fuss wasn ’ t about the latest glitzy song-and-dance movie churned out by india ’ s mainstream multibillion dollar bombay-based film industry known as bollywood .
rather it was the shooting of a weighty historical epic tracing the last five years in the life of subhas chandra bose or netaji -lrb- the leader -rrb- , who set up the indian national army in exile to fight against british colonial rule during world war ii .
titled " netaji : the last hero , " the film directed by 70-year-old indian cinema legend shyam benegal , throws light on a little-known , almost strange , chapter of indo-german history .
the shooting stint in germany focuses on bose ’ s two-year stay in berlin in the early 1940s and his single meeting with hitler when he requested the führer ’ s help in the indian independence struggle against the british empire .
" it ’ s the story of a great adventure , of a flamboyant person who was obviously a romantic as well as a strategist , because who would think of leaving the country and trying to raise an army to fight for indian independence from outside of india ? " director benegal , who is considered the pioneer of new wave indian cinema , told deutsche welle .
the enemy of my enemy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji subhas chandra bose in ina uniform bose -lrb- photo -rrb- , a revolutionary lawyer and leader of the congress party in india who stood in direct confrontation with gandhi ’ s passive and nonviolent resistance methods against the british , escaped from india in 1941 following british imprisonment and made his way to berlin , after failing to get himself smuggled to the soviet union .
bose ’ s plan was to get hitler ’ s help to stage a revolution in india that would distract british forces from the war against germany under the motto " the enemy of my enemy is my friend . "
he calculated that in the process , britain would lose the war against the militarily superior germany and as a consequence , lose india as well .
" however things didn ’ t quite turn out that way , " benegal said .
though the germans provided financial support for bose to broadcast radio propaganda messages to india , it wasn ’ t until more than a year later that hitler , allegedly impressed with bose ’ s cause , agreed to hear him out .
but the much-awaited meeting on may 27 , 1942 , ended in disappointment for the indian revolutionary .
" in that meeting , he -lsb- bose -rsb- asked hitler to cut out passages in " mein kampf " dealing with asians and -lsb- hitler said -rsb- that it was better for india to remain under british domination .
hitler refused to help him , " benegal explained .
german history professor johannes voigt , who authored a book on india during world war ii , said it wasn ’ t just hitler ’ s strong theories of race that stopped him from helping bose , whom he considered racially-inferior .
" he was convinced that colonial rule needed to be upheld if europe ’ s dominance was to continue .
besides india was too far away . "
indian pows and a submarine escape benegal ’ s three-hour , four-million-euro epic also dwells on what is considered bose ’ s biggest accomplishment in germany – the raising of a 3,000-strong indian legion force , made up of indian pows captured by the germans in the course of fighting in north africa .
the indian community in berlin was pressed into service to play the role of the troops .
bose envisioned the force spearheading an attack on the british while the germans swung through the soviet union and the middle east to india .
but that plan fell apart , too , when the germans were defeated at stalingrad in early 1943 .
" bose soon realized it was pointless for him to remain -lsb- in germany -rsb- much longer , " said benegal .
the germans , however , provided bose with the means to get out of germany to japan , where he believed he stood a better chance of organizing a large-scale indian army .
in february 1943 , the indian exile leader boarded the submarine u180 at the kiel harbor on the baltic coast , and traveled to the coast of mozambique , from where he transferred to a japanese submarine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netaji : the last hero by director shyam benegal in the movie , the escape from germany and the spectacular journey are filmed on site in kiel ’ s harbor -lrb- photo -rrb- .
after bose ’ s departure , the indian legion force in germany came to a sad end .
" their fate remains largely unknown .
they were absorbed into the regular german army and sent to fight in normandy , " said professor voigt .
" after the war , some came back through southern germany , many perished and some were sent back to india after the war . "
a gravestone inscription , " five unknown dead , 4.5.1945 " in immenstadt in swabia , southern germany , is believed to be one of the last remaining traces of the indian legion in germany today .
bose himself finally raised an army in burma and led the soldiers into india to fight the british , but he died in a plane crash in 1945 and never lived to see indian independence .
a touch of romance the memory of subhas chandra bose ’ s mission in germany isn ’ t just consigned to history books and archives .
bose married austrian emilie schenkl in the 1930s during his first visit to germany .
the couple moved to berlin where they had a daughter , anita .
today bose ’ s daughter , anita pfaff , is an economics professor at augsburg university in southern germany .
director benegal ’ s shooting at the marquardt castle involves romantic scenes with bose and his wife -lrb- played by german actress anna prüstel -rrb- strolling through the picturesque grounds , a mellifluous hindi song playing in the background .
berlin actress prüstel said it was amazing how few people in germany were aware of bose ’ s visit to germany .
" this whole cooperation with hitler , bose ’ s go-it-alone attitude is simply so unbelievable .
i find it hard to understand how nobody ever used this material and got it out in the public , " she said .
scheduled to release in january next year , both in hindi and english , benegal ’ s action-packed film is expected to raise awareness of the revolutionary and his cause .
the veteran director -lrb- photo , below -rrb- , who has also made a film on gandhi ’ s life , said he wants " netaji : the last hero " to set the record straight on one of the most controversial political figures in pre-independent india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shyam benegal " among all the anti-colonial leaders in asia , he -lsb- bose -rsb- is the only one the british continue to claim was a traitor , " he said .
" but bose ’ s idealism was free of any kind of cynicism .
in that sense he had a simple , straightforward goal – to free india .
that makes him a hero figure to me .

the gardens are under restoration before the second phase of work begins , but critics in the south of england have called the project " vanity gardening " .
the latest attack , in an article in the spectator magazine by lady mary keen , criticised the amount of public subsidy that the duchess was seeking .
lady mary , daughter of the 6th earl howe questioned whether alnwick deserved such public investment .
" should those who are savvier and nobler than thou attract so much more money than those who are perhaps more deserving ? " she wrote .
but the duchess has said the attack is caused by jealousy that the gardens are in the north and not the south .
' perfect site ' she said : " there has been a campaign of sniping going on for some time in the south - it began because i went to europe to find my designers .
i wanted to find the best there was and that was in europe .
" i felt i have put my head above the parapet and am now being shot at .
" there was always annoyance that i had not built it in surrey or elsewhere in the south , but decided to build it in the north .
" yet there was a perfect derelict site available at alnwick to build the garden .
we know what we have done is of great quality .
" this garden does not belong to us , we have given it over to a public trust . "
she said the garden had not had any local public funding but the first phase had been built with a grant from the duke .
now she is seeking £ 16m of public funds to develop more of the northumbrian countryside into a " modern garden " which she hopes will bring jobs and prestige to the north .
inherited estate there are more than 65,000 flowers and shrubs planted , with varieties of plant from across europe .
the central attraction of the garden is a cascading water feature , which curves and courses between trees and shrubs .
leading belgian garden makers , jacques and peter wirtz , designed the 26-acre site .
the duchess was given the land , a former 18th-century walled garden , by her husband , the duke of northumberland , when he inherited the estate in 1995 .
she was also given £ 5m for the project by her husband .
the charitable alnwick garden trust has raised £ 1.2m , of which £ 800,000 was awarded by one north east , the regional development agency , and £ 450,000 came from european funding .

motorists are said to throw about 130,000 pieces of litter from vehicles on scotland 's roads each weekend .
local authorities must pay the cost of picking up the rubbish and the cleaning operation uses vital funds .
as a result , keep scotland tidy is launching a campaign aimed at shaming drivers into changing their habits .
a poster - featuring the message " bought in brechin ...
left in lanark " - was unveiled by environment minister ross finnie on monday .
john summers , the national director of keep scotland tidy , said : " safe in the cocoon of their car , the litter lout thinks no one is watching them and that it 's okay to dump their rubbish on the road .
" they think that their bit of rubbish wo n't make a difference - but it does . "
people should consider the damage they are doing to scotland 's environment and image ross finnie he said the campaign aimed to highlight how the countryside was being spoiled for both scots and tourists .
" the amount of litter on our roads and verges is a national disgrace , " he added .
" it makes our cities , towns and countryside look shabby and unattractive and is expensive to tidy up .
" it truly is time to raise a stop sign to car litter . "
environment minister ross finnie added : " litter is a blight on our country .
roadside litter in particular gives a bad impression of scotland to the thousands of visitors to these shores every year .
" throwing any object from a moving vehicle can also be dangerous to other road users and could cause accidents .
" people should consider the damage they are doing to scotland 's environment and image before carelessly and thoughtlessly tossing rubbish out of their car . "
' zero waste ' policy the scottish green party msp , robin harper , challenged mr finnie to introduce a plastic bag tax , provide kerbside recycling to every household and bring in a " zero waste " policy .
" these initiatives are all very well , but the executive is really only playing at being green , " he said .
a keep britain tidy poll into drivers ' habit suggested that 70 % of drivers in scotland thought throwing litter out of the car window was the most annoying habit on the road .

but te company said there were signs that passengers were recovering their confidence after the iraq war and the sars outbreak , with traffic towards long-haul destinations other than the us picking up for the first time since february .
check-in staff employed by ba staged a surprise walkout at heathrow on 18 july in protest against a new electronic clocking-on system which they feared would be used to push through changes in working conditions .
the move , which came at the start of a busy weekend in the middle of the holiday season , forced ba to cancel hundreds of flights , leaving thousands of passengers stranded for up to three days .
