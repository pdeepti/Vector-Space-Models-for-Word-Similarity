the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help . the german government is coming under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude towards military involvement in iraq following tuesday 's attack on the united nations in baghdad .
in the past months , berlin has used every opportunity to emphasize that it would not send german soldiers into post-war iraq , unless there was a clear u.n. mandate although it promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
despite this stance , the german government was among the first to condemn tuesday 's bloody attack on the u.n. in baghdad .
chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer called it an act that was directed not only against the u.n. , but against the international community as a whole .
german policy should stay the same foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner brushed aside international demands that germany should assume a military role in iraq to help secure peace there .
he referred to u.n. resolution 1483 , which states that it is the responsibility of the coalition forces to maintain stability and secure peace in post-war iraq .
" that hasn ’ t changed a bit after the terrible attack in baghdad , " said lindner .
the spokesman pointed out that germany was not part of the coalition forces .
" we would have liked to see a greater role for the united nations in the peacekeeping and reconstruction process , but it was not to be .
as things are at the moment , there ’ s no reason for the government to rethink its decision not to send german soldiers to iraq . "
yet statements like this have not prevented senior parliament members of the ruling social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties from thinking ahead and going through all the possible scenarios that might evolve in the wake of tuesday 's attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose the spd ’ s foreign affairs expert hans-ulrich klose said berlin should consider that the situation may change .
" what if the united nations requests military protection for its own members in iraq ?
that would certainly increase the pressure on the german government to rethink its current stance , " said klose .
" what i ’ m saying is that berlin should not categorically rule out sending soldiers to iraq under any circumstances . "
more power for the iraqis the greens ’ foreign affairs spokesman ludger vollmer , however , is skeptical whether an international peacekeeping mission to assist the coalition forces and the u.n. representatives on the ground would provide a solution to the conflict - and one that would serve the iraqi people .
" i , too , am in favor of rethinking the cooperation between the u.n. , the coalition forces and nato in iraq , " said vollmer .
" but the issue of sending german soldiers there is not one that has to be debated right now .
there first have to be viable political concepts as to how to secure lasting stability in post-war iraq .
i can ’ t see any such concepts right now . "
according to vollmer , the only solution in the long run is to hand over more power to the iraqis and keep foreign interference at the lowest possible level .
" as everyone can see , we are further away than ever from such a state of affairs . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder rules out troops for iraq the new u.n. resolution on iraq does little to change germany ’ s position on military involvement in the country .

" but the issue of sending german soldiers there is not one that has to be debated right now .
there first have to be viable political concepts as to how to secure lasting stability in post-war iraq .

according to vollmer , the only solution in the long run is to hand over more power to the iraqis and keep foreign interference at the lowest possible level .

berlin faces the same problem even in cases where an existing foreign mission is just supposed to be extended .

that is why the government is working on a so-called deployment law .

the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help . the german government is coming under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude towards military involvement in iraq following tuesday 's attack on the united nations in baghdad .
in the past months , berlin has used every opportunity to emphasize that it would not send german soldiers into post-war iraq , unless there was a clear u.n. mandate although it promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
despite this stance , the german government was among the first to condemn tuesday 's bloody attack on the u.n. in baghdad .
chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer called it an act that was directed not only against the u.n. , but against the international community as a whole .
german policy should stay the same foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner brushed aside international demands that germany should assume a military role in iraq to help secure peace there .
he referred to u.n. resolution 1483 , which states that it is the responsibility of the coalition forces to maintain stability and secure peace in post-war iraq .
" that hasn ’ t changed a bit after the terrible attack in baghdad , " said lindner .
the spokesman pointed out that germany was not part of the coalition forces .
" we would have liked to see a greater role for the united nations in the peacekeeping and reconstruction process , but it was not to be .
as things are at the moment , there ’ s no reason for the government to rethink its decision not to send german soldiers to iraq . "
yet statements like this have not prevented senior parliament members of the ruling social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties from thinking ahead and going through all the possible scenarios that might evolve in the wake of tuesday 's attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose the spd ’ s foreign affairs expert hans-ulrich klose said berlin should consider that the situation may change .
" what if the united nations requests military protection for its own members in iraq ?
that would certainly increase the pressure on the german government to rethink its current stance , " said klose .
" what i ’ m saying is that berlin should not categorically rule out sending soldiers to iraq under any circumstances . "
more power for the iraqis the greens ’ foreign affairs spokesman ludger vollmer , however , is skeptical whether an international peacekeeping mission to assist the coalition forces and the u.n. representatives on the ground would provide a solution to the conflict - and one that would serve the iraqi people .

the number of single people in germany is climbing , but finding that perfect partner seems harder than ever .
now more and more of them are trying new ways to find mr. or ms. right - online dating services are taking off . ruth elkins came to berlin from her native britain a year ago hoping to make her name as a journalist .
little did she expect that she would first achieve a modicum of fame when the country 's media christened her the " loveliest woman in berlin who just ca n't get a date . " the media firestorm that led to this minor celebrity got ignited when elkins wrote an article for the uk newspaper the independent in which she bemoaned her nearly dateless existence over the past year in this city of three million and chalked it up to the observation that german men simply do n't know how to flirt . " they ca n't engage in small talk , " elkins lamented .
" in britain we might break the ice with a bit of complaining about their weather and some good eye contact .
here in berlin , the men wo n't look at you and if they talk at all , they 're always going on about bloody goethe . " it 's not as if single men in germany , or single women for that matter , do n't want to meet potential partners , many do .
there 's also no shortage of single people to go around .
the number of single households in germany has grown from 33.6 percent in 1991 to 36.1 percent in 2000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.08.2003 regulating foreign deployments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting this german soldier to the right place is no easy task for the berlin government .
the german government faces a bureaucratic and often time-consuming procedure if it wants to send troops abroad .
but berlin hopes that a new deployment law will change this . in some countries , the head of government can simply order to send troops on a mission overseas .
but not in germany .
before any bundeswehr soldiers can be deployed abroad , germany 's lower house of parliament , or bundestag , has to approve the mission .
this also applies if it is solely for peacekeeping purposes .
this procedure , born of the mistakes of world war ii , ensures that no rash military actions are made by a selected few .
but , on the other hand , it can take weeks for such a decision to be reached .
it can also lead to domestic tensions .
berlin faces the same problem even in cases where an existing foreign mission is just supposed to be extended .
members of all parties are unhappy with this situation .
that is why the government is working on a so-called deployment law .
this legislation aims to precisely regulate the rights of the government and parliament in the case of sending soldiers abroad .
a problematic procedure germany 's time-consuming procedure on foreign deployments could blemish the country 's international reputation .
nato , for example , is currently setting up a response force to react quickly to crisis situations around the world .
the bundeswehr also wants to be part of this .
" but how is this supposed to work in practice ? " says christian schmidt , defense expert for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" if they then always have to say , we do n't know whether the soldiers can really be deployed at that time because a lengthy procedure in the german bundestag and from the government has to take place first , then it 's problematic . "
a deployment law could solve this problem , as it would allow the government to make a preliminary decision .
parliament could then be questioned retroactively .
legal basis stands the legal basis for germany 's deployment procedures is a 1994 ruling by the federal constitutional court .
at that time , the judges stated that the government had to seek parliamentary approval before it sent troops abroad .
but they also said that the government had to make a law that would precisely regulate this parliamentary role .
almost a decade has passed since , and it is only now that the government has seen the necessity for such legislation .
" in my opinion , we need a sensibly-made deployment law , " chancellor gerhard schröder said recently .
promoting the information flow some members of parliament also see it as a disadvantage that though they vote on foreign deployments , they are not then informed what happens during the mission .
this was the case , for example , with the german special troops sent to afghanistan .
the opposition christian democrats complained about the " secretiveness " of the government about this deployment .
their foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble said he urged the government to " strongly review " its information policy vis-à-vis the bundestag .
a deployment law could therefore also regulate the government 's duty to supply information to parliament and in turn clarify the bundestag 's subsequent control possibilities .
but since the new legislation is not yet there , the liberal free democratic party has taken legal action at the constitutional court over the information problem .
hoping to make the issue moot , chancellor schröder 's social democrats and his green coalition partners want to present a draft deployment bill to parliament later this year .

the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help . the german government is coming under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude towards military involvement in iraq following tuesday 's attack on the united nations in baghdad .
in the past months , berlin has used every opportunity to emphasize that it would not send german soldiers into post-war iraq , unless there was a clear u.n. mandate although it promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
despite this stance , the german government was among the first to condemn tuesday 's bloody attack on the u.n. in baghdad .
chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer called it an act that was directed not only against the u.n. , but against the international community as a whole .
german policy should stay the same foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner brushed aside international demands that germany should assume a military role in iraq to help secure peace there .
he referred to u.n. resolution 1483 , which states that it is the responsibility of the coalition forces to maintain stability and secure peace in post-war iraq .
" that hasn ’ t changed a bit after the terrible attack in baghdad , " said lindner .
the spokesman pointed out that germany was not part of the coalition forces .
" we would have liked to see a greater role for the united nations in the peacekeeping and reconstruction process , but it was not to be .
as things are at the moment , there ’ s no reason for the government to rethink its decision not to send german soldiers to iraq . "
yet statements like this have not prevented senior parliament members of the ruling social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties from thinking ahead and going through all the possible scenarios that might evolve in the wake of tuesday 's attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose the spd ’ s foreign affairs expert hans-ulrich klose said berlin should consider that the situation may change .
" what if the united nations requests military protection for its own members in iraq ?
that would certainly increase the pressure on the german government to rethink its current stance , " said klose .
" what i ’ m saying is that berlin should not categorically rule out sending soldiers to iraq under any circumstances . "
more power for the iraqis the greens ’ foreign affairs spokesman ludger vollmer , however , is skeptical whether an international peacekeeping mission to assist the coalition forces and the u.n. representatives on the ground would provide a solution to the conflict - and one that would serve the iraqi people .
" i , too , am in favor of rethinking the cooperation between the u.n. , the coalition forces and nato in iraq , " said vollmer .
" but the issue of sending german soldiers there is not one that has to be debated right now .
there first have to be viable political concepts as to how to secure lasting stability in post-war iraq .
i can ’ t see any such concepts right now . "
according to vollmer , the only solution in the long run is to hand over more power to the iraqis and keep foreign interference at the lowest possible level .
" as everyone can see , we are further away than ever from such a state of affairs .

the german government faces a bureaucratic and often time-consuming procedure if it wants to send troops abroad .
but berlin hopes that a new deployment law will change this . in some countries , the head of government can simply order to send troops on a mission overseas .
but not in germany .
before any bundeswehr soldiers can be deployed abroad , germany 's lower house of parliament , or bundestag , has to approve the mission .
this also applies if it is solely for peacekeeping purposes .
this procedure , born of the mistakes of world war ii , ensures that no rash military actions are made by a selected few .
but , on the other hand , it can take weeks for such a decision to be reached .
it can also lead to domestic tensions .
berlin faces the same problem even in cases where an existing foreign mission is just supposed to be extended .
members of all parties are unhappy with this situation .
that is why the government is working on a so-called deployment law .
this legislation aims to precisely regulate the rights of the government and parliament in the case of sending soldiers abroad .
a problematic procedure germany 's time-consuming procedure on foreign deployments could blemish the country 's international reputation .
nato , for example , is currently setting up a response force to react quickly to crisis situations around the world .
the bundeswehr also wants to be part of this .
" but how is this supposed to work in practice ? " says christian schmidt , defense expert for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" if they then always have to say , we do n't know whether the soldiers can really be deployed at that time because a lengthy procedure in the german bundestag and from the government has to take place first , then it 's problematic . "
a deployment law could solve this problem , as it would allow the government to make a preliminary decision .
parliament could then be questioned retroactively .
legal basis stands the legal basis for germany 's deployment procedures is a 1994 ruling by the federal constitutional court .
at that time , the judges stated that the government had to seek parliamentary approval before it sent troops abroad .
but they also said that the government had to make a law that would precisely regulate this parliamentary role .
almost a decade has passed since , and it is only now that the government has seen the necessity for such legislation .
" in my opinion , we need a sensibly-made deployment law , " chancellor gerhard schröder said recently .
promoting the information flow some members of parliament also see it as a disadvantage that though they vote on foreign deployments , they are not then informed what happens during the mission .
this was the case , for example , with the german special troops sent to afghanistan .
the opposition christian democrats complained about the " secretiveness " of the government about this deployment .
their foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble said he urged the government to " strongly review " its information policy vis-à-vis the bundestag .
a deployment law could therefore also regulate the government 's duty to supply information to parliament and in turn clarify the bundestag 's subsequent control possibilities .
but since the new legislation is not yet there , the liberal free democratic party has taken legal action at the constitutional court over the information problem .

the number of single people in germany is climbing , but finding that perfect partner seems harder than ever .
now more and more of them are trying new ways to find mr. or ms. right - online dating services are taking off . ruth elkins came to berlin from her native britain a year ago hoping to make her name as a journalist .
little did she expect that she would first achieve a modicum of fame when the country 's media christened her the " loveliest woman in berlin who just ca n't get a date . " the media firestorm that led to this minor celebrity got ignited when elkins wrote an article for the uk newspaper the independent in which she bemoaned her nearly dateless existence over the past year in this city of three million and chalked it up to the observation that german men simply do n't know how to flirt . " they ca n't engage in small talk , " elkins lamented .
" in britain we might break the ice with a bit of complaining about their weather and some good eye contact .
here in berlin , the men wo n't look at you and if they talk at all , they 're always going on about bloody goethe . " it 's not as if single men in germany , or single women for that matter , do n't want to meet potential partners , many do .
there 's also no shortage of single people to go around .
the number of single households in germany has grown from 33.6 percent in 1991 to 36.1 percent in 2000 .
the trend shows no sign of slowing .
in just two years , from 2000 to 2002 , the number of single households in germany jumped almost half a million . " the general consensus among my german female friends is that it 's harder to meet men when you 're out on the town , " said elkins . maybe she and her friends have been looking in the wrong place . singles bars go digital online dating has become the choice of many single people in germany who do n't particularly want to stay single , but also have little desire or time to hang out in bars . " when i come home exhausted after work in the evenings , i do n't feel like having to get ready and then go back out again into the city , " said carsten bade , 32 , who has discovered that internet dating services are an attractive alternative to the primping and posing that the bar scene requires .
" i can start the whole dating game in a very relaxed way by turning on the computer . " more and more germans are doing just that , turning on the computer and pointing their browser to one of the flood of online dating sites that are springing up in germany .
a recent survey found that 62 percent of all unmarried germans said they had set up a date either through e-mail or an internet chat room .
the same study also found that 45 percent of those using internet dating services do so because they personally know a couple who met online . for germany 's internet service providers , cyberdating is proving to be an emerging growth sector and both the country 's biggest online players and more traditional media outlets are hoping to make some money off of it .
this summer t-online , a unit of deutsche telekom and germany 's largest web portal , plans on introducing match.com , the world leader in online dating , to its site .
yahoo , aol and freenet are already in the cyberdating business .
old economy companies not often thought of in connection with the latest internet fad also see potential profit in wooing on the web .
retailing giant metro has gotten into the game , as has the publisher of germany 's esteemed newspaper , die zeit . yahoo germany 's head frank dillitzer told the newsmagazine der spiegel he hopes to see turnover " in the tens of millions " of euros from their online dating services .
its advocates say they 've found a business model that can actually made money , unlike many other online enterprises .
there are no warehousing expenses , no delivery costs or expensive development departments .

the number of single people in germany is climbing , but finding that perfect partner seems harder than ever .
now more and more of them are trying new ways to find mr. or ms. right - online dating services are taking off . ruth elkins came to berlin from her native britain a year ago hoping to make her name as a journalist .
little did she expect that she would first achieve a modicum of fame when the country 's media christened her the " loveliest woman in berlin who just ca n't get a date . " the media firestorm that led to this minor celebrity got ignited when elkins wrote an article for the uk newspaper the independent in which she bemoaned her nearly dateless existence over the past year in this city of three million and chalked it up to the observation that german men simply do n't know how to flirt . " they ca n't engage in small talk , " elkins lamented .
" in britain we might break the ice with a bit of complaining about their weather and some good eye contact .

" i can start the whole dating game in a very relaxed way by turning on the computer . " more and more germans are doing just that , turning on the computer and pointing their browser to one of the flood of online dating sites that are springing up in germany .
a recent survey found that 62 percent of all unmarried germans said they had set up a date either through e-mail or an internet chat room .
the same study also found that 45 percent of those using internet dating services do so because they personally know a couple who met online . for germany 's internet service providers , cyberdating is proving to be an emerging growth sector and both the country 's biggest online players and more traditional media outlets are hoping to make some money off of it .

the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help . the german government is coming under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude towards military involvement in iraq following tuesday 's attack on the united nations in baghdad .
in the past months , berlin has used every opportunity to emphasize that it would not send german soldiers into post-war iraq , unless there was a clear u.n. mandate although it promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
despite this stance , the german government was among the first to condemn tuesday 's bloody attack on the u.n. in baghdad .
chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer called it an act that was directed not only against the u.n. , but against the international community as a whole .
german policy should stay the same foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner brushed aside international demands that germany should assume a military role in iraq to help secure peace there .
he referred to u.n. resolution 1483 , which states that it is the responsibility of the coalition forces to maintain stability and secure peace in post-war iraq .
" that hasn ’ t changed a bit after the terrible attack in baghdad , " said lindner .
the spokesman pointed out that germany was not part of the coalition forces .
" we would have liked to see a greater role for the united nations in the peacekeeping and reconstruction process , but it was not to be .
as things are at the moment , there ’ s no reason for the government to rethink its decision not to send german soldiers to iraq . "
yet statements like this have not prevented senior parliament members of the ruling social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties from thinking ahead and going through all the possible scenarios that might evolve in the wake of tuesday 's attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose the spd ’ s foreign affairs expert hans-ulrich klose said berlin should consider that the situation may change .
" what if the united nations requests military protection for its own members in iraq ?
that would certainly increase the pressure on the german government to rethink its current stance , " said klose .
" what i ’ m saying is that berlin should not categorically rule out sending soldiers to iraq under any circumstances . "
more power for the iraqis the greens ’ foreign affairs spokesman ludger vollmer , however , is skeptical whether an international peacekeeping mission to assist the coalition forces and the u.n. representatives on the ground would provide a solution to the conflict - and one that would serve the iraqi people .
" i , too , am in favor of rethinking the cooperation between the u.n. , the coalition forces and nato in iraq , " said vollmer .
" but the issue of sending german soldiers there is not one that has to be debated right now .
there first have to be viable political concepts as to how to secure lasting stability in post-war iraq .
i can ’ t see any such concepts right now . "
according to vollmer , the only solution in the long run is to hand over more power to the iraqis and keep foreign interference at the lowest possible level .

the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help . the german government is coming under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude towards military involvement in iraq following tuesday 's attack on the united nations in baghdad .
in the past months , berlin has used every opportunity to emphasize that it would not send german soldiers into post-war iraq , unless there was a clear u.n. mandate although it promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
despite this stance , the german government was among the first to condemn tuesday 's bloody attack on the u.n. in baghdad .
chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer called it an act that was directed not only against the u.n. , but against the international community as a whole .
german policy should stay the same foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner brushed aside international demands that germany should assume a military role in iraq to help secure peace there .
he referred to u.n. resolution 1483 , which states that it is the responsibility of the coalition forces to maintain stability and secure peace in post-war iraq .
" that hasn ’ t changed a bit after the terrible attack in baghdad , " said lindner .
the spokesman pointed out that germany was not part of the coalition forces .
" we would have liked to see a greater role for the united nations in the peacekeeping and reconstruction process , but it was not to be .
as things are at the moment , there ’ s no reason for the government to rethink its decision not to send german soldiers to iraq . "
yet statements like this have not prevented senior parliament members of the ruling social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties from thinking ahead and going through all the possible scenarios that might evolve in the wake of tuesday 's attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose the spd ’ s foreign affairs expert hans-ulrich klose said berlin should consider that the situation may change .
" what if the united nations requests military protection for its own members in iraq ?

" what i ’ m saying is that berlin should not categorically rule out sending soldiers to iraq under any circumstances . "

the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help . the german government is coming under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude towards military involvement in iraq following tuesday 's attack on the united nations in baghdad .
in the past months , berlin has used every opportunity to emphasize that it would not send german soldiers into post-war iraq , unless there was a clear u.n. mandate although it promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
despite this stance , the german government was among the first to condemn tuesday 's bloody attack on the u.n. in baghdad .
chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer called it an act that was directed not only against the u.n. , but against the international community as a whole .
german policy should stay the same foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner brushed aside international demands that germany should assume a military role in iraq to help secure peace there .
he referred to u.n. resolution 1483 , which states that it is the responsibility of the coalition forces to maintain stability and secure peace in post-war iraq .
" that hasn ’ t changed a bit after the terrible attack in baghdad , " said lindner .
the spokesman pointed out that germany was not part of the coalition forces .
" we would have liked to see a greater role for the united nations in the peacekeeping and reconstruction process , but it was not to be .
as things are at the moment , there ’ s no reason for the government to rethink its decision not to send german soldiers to iraq . "
yet statements like this have not prevented senior parliament members of the ruling social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties from thinking ahead and going through all the possible scenarios that might evolve in the wake of tuesday 's attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose the spd ’ s foreign affairs expert hans-ulrich klose said berlin should consider that the situation may change .
" what if the united nations requests military protection for its own members in iraq ?
that would certainly increase the pressure on the german government to rethink its current stance , " said klose .
" what i ’ m saying is that berlin should not categorically rule out sending soldiers to iraq under any circumstances . "
more power for the iraqis the greens ’ foreign affairs spokesman ludger vollmer , however , is skeptical whether an international peacekeeping mission to assist the coalition forces and the u.n. representatives on the ground would provide a solution to the conflict - and one that would serve the iraqi people .
" i , too , am in favor of rethinking the cooperation between the u.n. , the coalition forces and nato in iraq , " said vollmer .
" but the issue of sending german soldiers there is not one that has to be debated right now .
there first have to be viable political concepts as to how to secure lasting stability in post-war iraq .
i can ’ t see any such concepts right now . "
according to vollmer , the only solution in the long run is to hand over more power to the iraqis and keep foreign interference at the lowest possible level .

the number of single people in germany is climbing , but finding that perfect partner seems harder than ever .
now more and more of them are trying new ways to find mr. or ms. right - online dating services are taking off . ruth elkins came to berlin from her native britain a year ago hoping to make her name as a journalist .
little did she expect that she would first achieve a modicum of fame when the country 's media christened her the " loveliest woman in berlin who just ca n't get a date . " the media firestorm that led to this minor celebrity got ignited when elkins wrote an article for the uk newspaper the independent in which she bemoaned her nearly dateless existence over the past year in this city of three million and chalked it up to the observation that german men simply do n't know how to flirt . " they ca n't engage in small talk , " elkins lamented .
" in britain we might break the ice with a bit of complaining about their weather and some good eye contact .
here in berlin , the men wo n't look at you and if they talk at all , they 're always going on about bloody goethe . " it 's not as if single men in germany , or single women for that matter , do n't want to meet potential partners , many do .
there 's also no shortage of single people to go around .
the number of single households in germany has grown from 33.6 percent in 1991 to 36.1 percent in 2000 .
the trend shows no sign of slowing .
in just two years , from 2000 to 2002 , the number of single households in germany jumped almost half a million . " the general consensus among my german female friends is that it 's harder to meet men when you 're out on the town , " said elkins . maybe she and her friends have been looking in the wrong place . singles bars go digital online dating has become the choice of many single people in germany who do n't particularly want to stay single , but also have little desire or time to hang out in bars . " when i come home exhausted after work in the evenings , i do n't feel like having to get ready and then go back out again into the city , " said carsten bade , 32 , who has discovered that internet dating services are an attractive alternative to the primping and posing that the bar scene requires .
" i can start the whole dating game in a very relaxed way by turning on the computer . " more and more germans are doing just that , turning on the computer and pointing their browser to one of the flood of online dating sites that are springing up in germany .
a recent survey found that 62 percent of all unmarried germans said they had set up a date either through e-mail or an internet chat room .
the same study also found that 45 percent of those using internet dating services do so because they personally know a couple who met online . for germany 's internet service providers , cyberdating is proving to be an emerging growth sector and both the country 's biggest online players and more traditional media outlets are hoping to make some money off of it .
this summer t-online , a unit of deutsche telekom and germany 's largest web portal , plans on introducing match.com , the world leader in online dating , to its site .
yahoo , aol and freenet are already in the cyberdating business .
old economy companies not often thought of in connection with the latest internet fad also see potential profit in wooing on the web .
retailing giant metro has gotten into the game , as has the publisher of germany 's esteemed newspaper , die zeit . yahoo germany 's head frank dillitzer told the newsmagazine der spiegel he hopes to see turnover " in the tens of millions " of euros from their online dating services .
its advocates say they 've found a business model that can actually made money , unlike many other online enterprises .
there are no warehousing expenses , no delivery costs or expensive development departments .
and as opposed to other forms of online entertainment , more and more surfers seem willing to pay subscription fees to browse potential partners or pay one-time charges when they want to contact a particular person . lower-risk dating online dating is ideal for today 's singles , said stefan hradil , professor at the university of mainz who researches the topic .
it fits into their schedules and carries less stress with it then the old fashioned method . " people like their independence , and the internet offers them a place to meet without feeling much obligation , " he told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the old way to meet people .
traditional meeting places , like bars and clubs , the gym or restaurants having fallen behind the internet as places to meet , or at least go on the prowl for that special someone . according to a study conducted by the society for consumer research , only private parties and the office beat out online dating as preferred pickup places .
for many online germans , the fees paid for an address of the person whose profile they 've just seen seem a better investment than money poured into drinks and new outfits for the club . as with any dating , disappointments with the online version are unavoidable .
many a person has build up an image of the perfect partner in his or her mind through e-mails and private chats , only to be bitterly disillusioned when the real-time date takes place . berlin 's " lonely journalist " elkins , for one , says she 's open to looking for mr. right in cyberspace , since her traditional methods do n't seem to be working . " the whole thing 's rather funny until another saturday night rolls around and i find myself in front of the telly with only an open pizza box as company , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de looking for love in her new short feature film , november wanderin attempts to break down clichés about jews by telling a tale of the dating adventures of two jewish sisters in berlin .

the number of single people in germany is climbing , but finding that perfect partner seems harder than ever .
now more and more of them are trying new ways to find mr. or ms. right - online dating services are taking off . ruth elkins came to berlin from her native britain a year ago hoping to make her name as a journalist .
little did she expect that she would first achieve a modicum of fame when the country 's media christened her the " loveliest woman in berlin who just ca n't get a date . " the media firestorm that led to this minor celebrity got ignited when elkins wrote an article for the uk newspaper the independent in which she bemoaned her nearly dateless existence over the past year in this city of three million and chalked it up to the observation that german men simply do n't know how to flirt . " they ca n't engage in small talk , " elkins lamented .
" in britain we might break the ice with a bit of complaining about their weather and some good eye contact .
here in berlin , the men wo n't look at you and if they talk at all , they 're always going on about bloody goethe . " it 's not as if single men in germany , or single women for that matter , do n't want to meet potential partners , many do .
there 's also no shortage of single people to go around .
the number of single households in germany has grown from 33.6 percent in 1991 to 36.1 percent in 2000 .
the trend shows no sign of slowing .
in just two years , from 2000 to 2002 , the number of single households in germany jumped almost half a million . " the general consensus among my german female friends is that it 's harder to meet men when you 're out on the town , " said elkins . maybe she and her friends have been looking in the wrong place . singles bars go digital online dating has become the choice of many single people in germany who do n't particularly want to stay single , but also have little desire or time to hang out in bars . " when i come home exhausted after work in the evenings , i do n't feel like having to get ready and then go back out again into the city , " said carsten bade , 32 , who has discovered that internet dating services are an attractive alternative to the primping and posing that the bar scene requires .
" i can start the whole dating game in a very relaxed way by turning on the computer . " more and more germans are doing just that , turning on the computer and pointing their browser to one of the flood of online dating sites that are springing up in germany .
a recent survey found that 62 percent of all unmarried germans said they had set up a date either through e-mail or an internet chat room .
the same study also found that 45 percent of those using internet dating services do so because they personally know a couple who met online . for germany 's internet service providers , cyberdating is proving to be an emerging growth sector and both the country 's biggest online players and more traditional media outlets are hoping to make some money off of it .

yahoo , aol and freenet are already in the cyberdating business .
old economy companies not often thought of in connection with the latest internet fad also see potential profit in wooing on the web .
retailing giant metro has gotten into the game , as has the publisher of germany 's esteemed newspaper , die zeit . yahoo germany 's head frank dillitzer told the newsmagazine der spiegel he hopes to see turnover " in the tens of millions " of euros from their online dating services .

the german government faces a bureaucratic and often time-consuming procedure if it wants to send troops abroad .
but berlin hopes that a new deployment law will change this . in some countries , the head of government can simply order to send troops on a mission overseas .

before any bundeswehr soldiers can be deployed abroad , germany 's lower house of parliament , or bundestag , has to approve the mission .

it can also lead to domestic tensions .
berlin faces the same problem even in cases where an existing foreign mission is just supposed to be extended .
members of all parties are unhappy with this situation .
that is why the government is working on a so-called deployment law .

the opposition christian democrats complained about the " secretiveness " of the government about this deployment .
their foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble said he urged the government to " strongly review " its information policy vis-à-vis the bundestag .
a deployment law could therefore also regulate the government 's duty to supply information to parliament and in turn clarify the bundestag 's subsequent control possibilities .

their foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble said he urged the government to " strongly review " its information policy vis-à-vis the bundestag .
a deployment law could therefore also regulate the government 's duty to supply information to parliament and in turn clarify the bundestag 's subsequent control possibilities .
but since the new legislation is not yet there , the liberal free democratic party has taken legal action at the constitutional court over the information problem .
hoping to make the issue moot , chancellor schröder 's social democrats and his green coalition partners want to present a draft deployment bill to parliament later this year .

the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help . the german government is coming under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude towards military involvement in iraq following tuesday 's attack on the united nations in baghdad .
in the past months , berlin has used every opportunity to emphasize that it would not send german soldiers into post-war iraq , unless there was a clear u.n. mandate although it promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
despite this stance , the german government was among the first to condemn tuesday 's bloody attack on the u.n. in baghdad .
chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer called it an act that was directed not only against the u.n. , but against the international community as a whole .
german policy should stay the same foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner brushed aside international demands that germany should assume a military role in iraq to help secure peace there .
he referred to u.n. resolution 1483 , which states that it is the responsibility of the coalition forces to maintain stability and secure peace in post-war iraq .
" that hasn ’ t changed a bit after the terrible attack in baghdad , " said lindner .
the spokesman pointed out that germany was not part of the coalition forces .
" we would have liked to see a greater role for the united nations in the peacekeeping and reconstruction process , but it was not to be .
as things are at the moment , there ’ s no reason for the government to rethink its decision not to send german soldiers to iraq . "
yet statements like this have not prevented senior parliament members of the ruling social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties from thinking ahead and going through all the possible scenarios that might evolve in the wake of tuesday 's attack .

" what i ’ m saying is that berlin should not categorically rule out sending soldiers to iraq under any circumstances . "
more power for the iraqis the greens ’ foreign affairs spokesman ludger vollmer , however , is skeptical whether an international peacekeeping mission to assist the coalition forces and the u.n. representatives on the ground would provide a solution to the conflict - and one that would serve the iraqi people .

" but the issue of sending german soldiers there is not one that has to be debated right now .
there first have to be viable political concepts as to how to secure lasting stability in post-war iraq .

that would certainly increase the pressure on the german government to rethink its current stance , " said klose .
" what i ’ m saying is that berlin should not categorically rule out sending soldiers to iraq under any circumstances . "
more power for the iraqis the greens ’ foreign affairs spokesman ludger vollmer , however , is skeptical whether an international peacekeeping mission to assist the coalition forces and the u.n. representatives on the ground would provide a solution to the conflict - and one that would serve the iraqi people .
" i , too , am in favor of rethinking the cooperation between the u.n. , the coalition forces and nato in iraq , " said vollmer .
" but the issue of sending german soldiers there is not one that has to be debated right now .
there first have to be viable political concepts as to how to secure lasting stability in post-war iraq .
i can ’ t see any such concepts right now . "
according to vollmer , the only solution in the long run is to hand over more power to the iraqis and keep foreign interference at the lowest possible level .
" as everyone can see , we are further away than ever from such a state of affairs .

little did she expect that she would first achieve a modicum of fame when the country 's media christened her the " loveliest woman in berlin who just ca n't get a date . " the media firestorm that led to this minor celebrity got ignited when elkins wrote an article for the uk newspaper the independent in which she bemoaned her nearly dateless existence over the past year in this city of three million and chalked it up to the observation that german men simply do n't know how to flirt . " they ca n't engage in small talk , " elkins lamented .
" in britain we might break the ice with a bit of complaining about their weather and some good eye contact .

" i can start the whole dating game in a very relaxed way by turning on the computer . " more and more germans are doing just that , turning on the computer and pointing their browser to one of the flood of online dating sites that are springing up in germany .

it can also lead to domestic tensions .
berlin faces the same problem even in cases where an existing foreign mission is just supposed to be extended .
members of all parties are unhappy with this situation .
that is why the government is working on a so-called deployment law .

" if they then always have to say , we do n't know whether the soldiers can really be deployed at that time because a lengthy procedure in the german bundestag and from the government has to take place first , then it 's problematic . "

" if they then always have to say , we do n't know whether the soldiers can really be deployed at that time because a lengthy procedure in the german bundestag and from the government has to take place first , then it 's problematic . "
a deployment law could solve this problem , as it would allow the government to make a preliminary decision .
parliament could then be questioned retroactively .
legal basis stands the legal basis for germany 's deployment procedures is a 1994 ruling by the federal constitutional court .
at that time , the judges stated that the government had to seek parliamentary approval before it sent troops abroad .
but they also said that the government had to make a law that would precisely regulate this parliamentary role .
almost a decade has passed since , and it is only now that the government has seen the necessity for such legislation .
" in my opinion , we need a sensibly-made deployment law , " chancellor gerhard schröder said recently .
promoting the information flow some members of parliament also see it as a disadvantage that though they vote on foreign deployments , they are not then informed what happens during the mission .
this was the case , for example , with the german special troops sent to afghanistan .
the opposition christian democrats complained about the " secretiveness " of the government about this deployment .
their foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble said he urged the government to " strongly review " its information policy vis-à-vis the bundestag .
a deployment law could therefore also regulate the government 's duty to supply information to parliament and in turn clarify the bundestag 's subsequent control possibilities .
but since the new legislation is not yet there , the liberal free democratic party has taken legal action at the constitutional court over the information problem .
hoping to make the issue moot , chancellor schröder 's social democrats and his green coalition partners want to present a draft deployment bill to parliament later this year .
it is expected to be approved by a broad majority . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany deliberates military role in iraq the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help -lrb- august 21 , 2003 -rrb- .

the number of single people in germany is climbing , but finding that perfect partner seems harder than ever .
now more and more of them are trying new ways to find mr. or ms. right - online dating services are taking off . ruth elkins came to berlin from her native britain a year ago hoping to make her name as a journalist .
little did she expect that she would first achieve a modicum of fame when the country 's media christened her the " loveliest woman in berlin who just ca n't get a date . " the media firestorm that led to this minor celebrity got ignited when elkins wrote an article for the uk newspaper the independent in which she bemoaned her nearly dateless existence over the past year in this city of three million and chalked it up to the observation that german men simply do n't know how to flirt . " they ca n't engage in small talk , " elkins lamented .
" in britain we might break the ice with a bit of complaining about their weather and some good eye contact .
here in berlin , the men wo n't look at you and if they talk at all , they 're always going on about bloody goethe . " it 's not as if single men in germany , or single women for that matter , do n't want to meet potential partners , many do .

the german government faces a bureaucratic and often time-consuming procedure if it wants to send troops abroad .
but berlin hopes that a new deployment law will change this . in some countries , the head of government can simply order to send troops on a mission overseas .
but not in germany .
before any bundeswehr soldiers can be deployed abroad , germany 's lower house of parliament , or bundestag , has to approve the mission .
this also applies if it is solely for peacekeeping purposes .
this procedure , born of the mistakes of world war ii , ensures that no rash military actions are made by a selected few .
but , on the other hand , it can take weeks for such a decision to be reached .
it can also lead to domestic tensions .
berlin faces the same problem even in cases where an existing foreign mission is just supposed to be extended .
members of all parties are unhappy with this situation .
that is why the government is working on a so-called deployment law .
this legislation aims to precisely regulate the rights of the government and parliament in the case of sending soldiers abroad .
a problematic procedure germany 's time-consuming procedure on foreign deployments could blemish the country 's international reputation .
nato , for example , is currently setting up a response force to react quickly to crisis situations around the world .
the bundeswehr also wants to be part of this .
" but how is this supposed to work in practice ? " says christian schmidt , defense expert for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" if they then always have to say , we do n't know whether the soldiers can really be deployed at that time because a lengthy procedure in the german bundestag and from the government has to take place first , then it 's problematic . "
a deployment law could solve this problem , as it would allow the government to make a preliminary decision .
parliament could then be questioned retroactively .
legal basis stands the legal basis for germany 's deployment procedures is a 1994 ruling by the federal constitutional court .
at that time , the judges stated that the government had to seek parliamentary approval before it sent troops abroad .
but they also said that the government had to make a law that would precisely regulate this parliamentary role .
almost a decade has passed since , and it is only now that the government has seen the necessity for such legislation .
" in my opinion , we need a sensibly-made deployment law , " chancellor gerhard schröder said recently .
promoting the information flow some members of parliament also see it as a disadvantage that though they vote on foreign deployments , they are not then informed what happens during the mission .
this was the case , for example , with the german special troops sent to afghanistan .
the opposition christian democrats complained about the " secretiveness " of the government about this deployment .
their foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble said he urged the government to " strongly review " its information policy vis-à-vis the bundestag .
a deployment law could therefore also regulate the government 's duty to supply information to parliament and in turn clarify the bundestag 's subsequent control possibilities .
but since the new legislation is not yet there , the liberal free democratic party has taken legal action at the constitutional court over the information problem .

the german government faces a bureaucratic and often time-consuming procedure if it wants to send troops abroad .
but berlin hopes that a new deployment law will change this . in some countries , the head of government can simply order to send troops on a mission overseas .
but not in germany .
before any bundeswehr soldiers can be deployed abroad , germany 's lower house of parliament , or bundestag , has to approve the mission .
this also applies if it is solely for peacekeeping purposes .
this procedure , born of the mistakes of world war ii , ensures that no rash military actions are made by a selected few .
but , on the other hand , it can take weeks for such a decision to be reached .
it can also lead to domestic tensions .
berlin faces the same problem even in cases where an existing foreign mission is just supposed to be extended .
members of all parties are unhappy with this situation .
that is why the government is working on a so-called deployment law .
this legislation aims to precisely regulate the rights of the government and parliament in the case of sending soldiers abroad .
a problematic procedure germany 's time-consuming procedure on foreign deployments could blemish the country 's international reputation .
nato , for example , is currently setting up a response force to react quickly to crisis situations around the world .
the bundeswehr also wants to be part of this .
" but how is this supposed to work in practice ? " says christian schmidt , defense expert for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" if they then always have to say , we do n't know whether the soldiers can really be deployed at that time because a lengthy procedure in the german bundestag and from the government has to take place first , then it 's problematic . "
a deployment law could solve this problem , as it would allow the government to make a preliminary decision .
parliament could then be questioned retroactively .
legal basis stands the legal basis for germany 's deployment procedures is a 1994 ruling by the federal constitutional court .
at that time , the judges stated that the government had to seek parliamentary approval before it sent troops abroad .
but they also said that the government had to make a law that would precisely regulate this parliamentary role .
almost a decade has passed since , and it is only now that the government has seen the necessity for such legislation .
" in my opinion , we need a sensibly-made deployment law , " chancellor gerhard schröder said recently .
promoting the information flow some members of parliament also see it as a disadvantage that though they vote on foreign deployments , they are not then informed what happens during the mission .
this was the case , for example , with the german special troops sent to afghanistan .
the opposition christian democrats complained about the " secretiveness " of the government about this deployment .
their foreign policy spokesman wolfgang schäuble said he urged the government to " strongly review " its information policy vis-à-vis the bundestag .
a deployment law could therefore also regulate the government 's duty to supply information to parliament and in turn clarify the bundestag 's subsequent control possibilities .
but since the new legislation is not yet there , the liberal free democratic party has taken legal action at the constitutional court over the information problem .
hoping to make the issue moot , chancellor schröder 's social democrats and his green coalition partners want to present a draft deployment bill to parliament later this year .

the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help . the german government is coming under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude towards military involvement in iraq following tuesday 's attack on the united nations in baghdad .
in the past months , berlin has used every opportunity to emphasize that it would not send german soldiers into post-war iraq , unless there was a clear u.n. mandate although it promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
despite this stance , the german government was among the first to condemn tuesday 's bloody attack on the u.n. in baghdad .
chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer called it an act that was directed not only against the u.n. , but against the international community as a whole .
german policy should stay the same foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner brushed aside international demands that germany should assume a military role in iraq to help secure peace there .
he referred to u.n. resolution 1483 , which states that it is the responsibility of the coalition forces to maintain stability and secure peace in post-war iraq .
" that hasn ’ t changed a bit after the terrible attack in baghdad , " said lindner .
the spokesman pointed out that germany was not part of the coalition forces .
" we would have liked to see a greater role for the united nations in the peacekeeping and reconstruction process , but it was not to be .
as things are at the moment , there ’ s no reason for the government to rethink its decision not to send german soldiers to iraq . "
yet statements like this have not prevented senior parliament members of the ruling social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties from thinking ahead and going through all the possible scenarios that might evolve in the wake of tuesday 's attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose the spd ’ s foreign affairs expert hans-ulrich klose said berlin should consider that the situation may change .
" what if the united nations requests military protection for its own members in iraq ?
that would certainly increase the pressure on the german government to rethink its current stance , " said klose .
" what i ’ m saying is that berlin should not categorically rule out sending soldiers to iraq under any circumstances . "
more power for the iraqis the greens ’ foreign affairs spokesman ludger vollmer , however , is skeptical whether an international peacekeeping mission to assist the coalition forces and the u.n. representatives on the ground would provide a solution to the conflict - and one that would serve the iraqi people .
" i , too , am in favor of rethinking the cooperation between the u.n. , the coalition forces and nato in iraq , " said vollmer .
" but the issue of sending german soldiers there is not one that has to be debated right now .
there first have to be viable political concepts as to how to secure lasting stability in post-war iraq .
i can ’ t see any such concepts right now . "
according to vollmer , the only solution in the long run is to hand over more power to the iraqis and keep foreign interference at the lowest possible level .

the attack on the united nations headquarters in baghdad has sparked a new public debate in germany on whether or not to deploy soldiers to iraq if the u.n. or the coalition forces ask for help . the german government is coming under mounting pressure to rethink its attitude towards military involvement in iraq following tuesday 's attack on the united nations in baghdad .
in the past months , berlin has used every opportunity to emphasize that it would not send german soldiers into post-war iraq , unless there was a clear u.n. mandate although it promised humanitarian and reconstruction aid after the end of the u.s.-led invasion , the government has argued that those who waged the war must also deal with all issues concerning stability in the country .
despite this stance , the german government was among the first to condemn tuesday 's bloody attack on the u.n. in baghdad .
chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer called it an act that was directed not only against the u.n. , but against the international community as a whole .
german policy should stay the same foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner brushed aside international demands that germany should assume a military role in iraq to help secure peace there .
he referred to u.n. resolution 1483 , which states that it is the responsibility of the coalition forces to maintain stability and secure peace in post-war iraq .
" that hasn ’ t changed a bit after the terrible attack in baghdad , " said lindner .
the spokesman pointed out that germany was not part of the coalition forces .
" we would have liked to see a greater role for the united nations in the peacekeeping and reconstruction process , but it was not to be .
as things are at the moment , there ’ s no reason for the government to rethink its decision not to send german soldiers to iraq . "
yet statements like this have not prevented senior parliament members of the ruling social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- and green parties from thinking ahead and going through all the possible scenarios that might evolve in the wake of tuesday 's attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-ulrich klose the spd ’ s foreign affairs expert hans-ulrich klose said berlin should consider that the situation may change .
" what if the united nations requests military protection for its own members in iraq ?
that would certainly increase the pressure on the german government to rethink its current stance , " said klose .
" what i ’ m saying is that berlin should not categorically rule out sending soldiers to iraq under any circumstances . "
more power for the iraqis the greens ’ foreign affairs spokesman ludger vollmer , however , is skeptical whether an international peacekeeping mission to assist the coalition forces and the u.n. representatives on the ground would provide a solution to the conflict - and one that would serve the iraqi people .
" i , too , am in favor of rethinking the cooperation between the u.n. , the coalition forces and nato in iraq , " said vollmer .
" but the issue of sending german soldiers there is not one that has to be debated right now .
there first have to be viable political concepts as to how to secure lasting stability in post-war iraq .
i can ’ t see any such concepts right now . "
according to vollmer , the only solution in the long run is to hand over more power to the iraqis and keep foreign interference at the lowest possible level .
" as everyone can see , we are further away than ever from such a state of affairs .

the number of single people in germany is climbing , but finding that perfect partner seems harder than ever .
now more and more of them are trying new ways to find mr. or ms. right - online dating services are taking off . ruth elkins came to berlin from her native britain a year ago hoping to make her name as a journalist .
little did she expect that she would first achieve a modicum of fame when the country 's media christened her the " loveliest woman in berlin who just ca n't get a date . " the media firestorm that led to this minor celebrity got ignited when elkins wrote an article for the uk newspaper the independent in which she bemoaned her nearly dateless existence over the past year in this city of three million and chalked it up to the observation that german men simply do n't know how to flirt . " they ca n't engage in small talk , " elkins lamented .
" in britain we might break the ice with a bit of complaining about their weather and some good eye contact .
here in berlin , the men wo n't look at you and if they talk at all , they 're always going on about bloody goethe . " it 's not as if single men in germany , or single women for that matter , do n't want to meet potential partners , many do .
there 's also no shortage of single people to go around .
the number of single households in germany has grown from 33.6 percent in 1991 to 36.1 percent in 2000 .
the trend shows no sign of slowing .
in just two years , from 2000 to 2002 , the number of single households in germany jumped almost half a million . " the general consensus among my german female friends is that it 's harder to meet men when you 're out on the town , " said elkins . maybe she and her friends have been looking in the wrong place . singles bars go digital online dating has become the choice of many single people in germany who do n't particularly want to stay single , but also have little desire or time to hang out in bars . " when i come home exhausted after work in the evenings , i do n't feel like having to get ready and then go back out again into the city , " said carsten bade , 32 , who has discovered that internet dating services are an attractive alternative to the primping and posing that the bar scene requires .
" i can start the whole dating game in a very relaxed way by turning on the computer . " more and more germans are doing just that , turning on the computer and pointing their browser to one of the flood of online dating sites that are springing up in germany .
a recent survey found that 62 percent of all unmarried germans said they had set up a date either through e-mail or an internet chat room .
the same study also found that 45 percent of those using internet dating services do so because they personally know a couple who met online . for germany 's internet service providers , cyberdating is proving to be an emerging growth sector and both the country 's biggest online players and more traditional media outlets are hoping to make some money off of it .

in france , heatwave woes and economic worries continue to generate comment .
a scandal involving politicians in hamburg 's regional government draws the attention of german papers .
and a ukrainian paper reports on special prison cells for " rich criminals " .
czechoslovakia , 1968 in the czech republic all major dailies mark the 35th anniversary of the invasion by the forces of the warsaw pact that crushed the former czechoslovakia 's communist reform movement , known as the prague spring .
those seven months of work towards a freer society were an act of creation and vision pravo the cause of the invasion , a commentary in mlada fronta dnes believes , was that the former czechoslovakia , " instead of trying to throw off the yoke of communism , sought instead to improve it " .
" the kremlin leaders must have been surprised when they started receiving advice from prague on the proper form of communism " .
" the paradox of history , " it observes , " is that the czech recipe for improving communism would only have lead to its swift destruction , as gorbachev demonstrated 20 years later " .
in the opinion of a commentary in pravo , " the prague spring was not in vain . "
the truth is that czechoslovakia became a battlefield between two groups of communists , and the ' nicer ' ones were defeated hospodarske noviny " those seven months of work towards a freer society , " it says , " were an act of creation and vision , an attempt to take a heroic stance towards our own history " .
but a commentary in hospodarske noviny questions the wisdom of marking the day .
" is there any point , " it asks , " in commemorating further proof that great powers often trample upon the rights of smaller nations ? "
" the truth " about the prague spring , it says , is that " czechoslovakia became a battlefield between two groups of communists , and the ' nicer ' ones were defeated " .
" but they were still communists and wanted to build socialism . "
the anniversary does not pass unnoticed in the former soviet union .
" august 1968 was a time of lost hopes for change in society and of ' fraternal assistance ' from soviet tanks , " a commentary in russia 's izvestiya says .
" the arrival of soviet troops in czechkoslovakia is often called an ' invasion ' but it was more like a ' hostile takeover ' , a term used in business to describe one major company swallowing another . "
france 's unhappy summer according to a report in france 's le figaro , the country 's main chain of undertakers estimates that the total number of heatwave-related deaths for august may be as high as 13,600 , more than double the government 's figure .
the paper expects the issue to be high on the agenda during today 's cabinet session - the first since the summer break - which , it notes , should also be used by president jacques chirac to " break his silence " on the subject .
the slowness of the response to the health situation has given unexpected ammunition to the -lsb- opposition -rsb- socialists le monde " another piece of bad news " for the government , the paper adds , is the 0.3 % drop in the country 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in the first quarter .
" it is now clear that economic growth this year will fall far short of the 1.3 % expected by the government . "
" there is a growing incompatibility , " the paper says , " between the promised cuts in income tax and the european commission 's warning that france must put its public finances in order . "
le monde agrees that things are not looking easy for the french government .
prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's autumn , it says , " will not begin under the best auspices " .
mr raffarin " had hoped that the return from the summer break would bring a new impetus " to his cabinet team , the paper says , " but in fact the government looks more shaken than rested " .
" the slowness of the response to the gravity of the health situation has given unexpected ammunition to the -lsb- opposition -rsb- socialists . "
besides the consequences of the heatwave , the government will be faced with continuing unrest among schoolteachers and workers in the entertainment industry , it says , not to mention " the formidable tasks of completing the 2004 budget and the bill on financing a social security system which is showing an accumulated deficit of 16 billion euros " .
a scandal in germany several german papers consider the wider implications of a political crisis in hamburg , whose christian democratic mayor , ole von beust , has sacked the city-state 's right-wing populist interior minister , ronald schill , over allegations of blackmail .
mr von beust has said that mr schill had threatened to tell the media that the mayor was having a homosexual affair with the city 's justice minister unless he withdrew a threat to sack an interior ministry official suspected of corruption .
in germany , too , many politicians have become celebrities - and this is not a good thing sueddeutsche zeitung for the sueddeutsche zeitung , the hamburg scandal is a " lesson on what can happen when a party , the christian democrats , joins forces with a dubious partner in order to gain power " .
mr schill , according to the paper , was lacking in " the character department " .
the scandal also shows the extent to which politicians ' private lives are intruding into politics , the paper says , " even in germany where this kind of scandal was more the exception than the rule for decades " .
this trend , it believes , has changed the political culture , and both the media and politicians are to blame .
" in our country , too , many politicians have become celebrities - and this is not a good thing . "
according to die welt , mr schill " sought to use the accusation of homosexuality as a political weapon " and , as a result , " he was punished not only by being sacked but also by the public 's contempt " .
" what was seen as ' dirty ' , " the paper argues , " was not the nature of the disclosure but his attempt to exert pressure by means of alleged disclosures over the mayor 's private life " .
three-star prison special " business cells " for ukraine 's rich criminals have appeared in dnipropetrovsk , according to the ukrainian newspaper fakty i kommentarii .
following a recent refurbishment , " the cells have been so luxuriously fitted out that they are superior to many hotels . "
" each business cell is big enough for two people , " it reports .
" pretty bedspreads cover the wooden beds .
there is a desk , a tv set and a fridge . "
instead of having to slop out , business prisoners have access to a proper low-level toilet , and " can wash and shower with hot water " .
" the cost of such luxuries is 116 hryvnyas -lrb- about $ 20 -rrb- per night - roughly as much as staying in a three-star hotel . "
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

a scandal in germany several german papers consider the wider implications of a political crisis in hamburg , whose christian democratic mayor , ole von beust , has sacked the city-state 's right-wing populist interior minister , ronald schill , over allegations of blackmail .

this trend , it believes , has changed the political culture , and both the media and politicians are to blame .

more than 30 people have been killed , scores injured and thousands made homeless in the political and ethnic clashes .
the bbc 's dan isaacs in warri says the town is unnaturally quiet - but that the grievances that led to the crisis remain unresolved .
the violence between the ijaw and itsekiri people - two of the main ethnic groups in the oil-rich delta region of nigeria - has been the worst since march , when several multi-national oil companies were force to halt their operations .
criminal link ?
the delta state governor james ibori arrived in warri on wednesday to try to resolve the crisis .
following talks with the warring communities he told reporters he hoped both sides would heed his appeal to lay down their arms .
he said he understood that some communities felt excluded from the economic benefits of the oil rich delta region but said the solution lay in dialogue and not armed confrontation .
the ijaw perceive the itsekiri to have been favoured by both the government and multi-national oil companies operating in the area .
but our correspondent says many people in warri believe the real dispute is about which of the heavily armed groups controls the illegal trade in stolen crude oil .
industry analysts estimate that at least 100,000 barrels of oil are diverted from official exports every day - rich pickings for the criminal underworld , using ethnic rivalries as an excuse for gang warfare .
shell has advised its office staff not to turn up for work for the time being , but said oil-production had not been disrupted .
following the violence in march , the oil companies evacuated most of their operational staff from the area , drastically cutting back production .
some of that output has subsequently been restored , but these latest clashes are once again causing concern over the impact they will have on nigeria 's oil industry .

they are launching a campaign to persuade mobile litter bugs to keep a grip on their rubbish .
as well as costing millions , keep wales tidy says complaints about rubbish levels by visitors to the country raise the threat of deterring tourists from welsh resorts .

" so not only is it costing us £ 35m a year to clean wales ' streets and causing traffic delays during local authority cleansing work , but it is having a potentially much greater detrimental effect on our tourism industry . "
he said roadside litter had increased as a throwaway culture grew .
a survey released on the same day as the campaign begins found mobile litter louts were the number one bugbear for fellow drivers .
motorists from different social and economic backgrounds rated throwing litter out of a moving car the most annoying driving habit , with 77 % placing it top , ahead of using a mobile phone while driving .
keep wales tidy is distributing stickers to the assembly , councils , and bus , haulage and van hire companies to get the anti-litter message on the road .
the campaign is being officially launched by former wales rugby international ieuan evans on thursday , ahead of the bank holiday weekend .

as well as costing millions , keep wales tidy says complaints about rubbish levels by visitors to the country raise the threat of deterring tourists from welsh resorts .
keep wales tidy director bob gilchrist said : " it is high time we started viewing car litter as a serious issue .
rubbish .. is having a potentially detrimental effect on our tourism industry bob gilchrist " around this time of year the wales tourist board , the welsh assembly and ourselves are inundated with complaints from visitors about the amount of rubbish on our streets and roads and what a terrible eyesore it is .
" so not only is it costing us £ 35m a year to clean wales ' streets and causing traffic delays during local authority cleansing work , but it is having a potentially much greater detrimental effect on our tourism industry . "
he said roadside litter had increased as a throwaway culture grew .
a survey released on the same day as the campaign begins found mobile litter louts were the number one bugbear for fellow drivers .
motorists from different social and economic backgrounds rated throwing litter out of a moving car the most annoying driving habit , with 77 % placing it top , ahead of using a mobile phone while driving .
keep wales tidy is distributing stickers to the assembly , councils , and bus , haulage and van hire companies to get the anti-litter message on the road .
the campaign is being officially launched by former wales rugby international ieuan evans on thursday , ahead of the bank holiday weekend .

the hollywood film star said his first act as governor would be to organise an independent audit of california 's budget to identify the problems .
mr schwarzenegger vowed to cut spending but not raise taxes - he did not give details about where he would make the budget cuts .
his proclamations came the day after governor gray davis launched an offensive to keep his job while lieutenant-governor cruz bustamante revealed tax plans he says would help california should he become leader .
separately , a judge on wednesday refused to postpone the 7 october ballot where californian voters will be asked whether to oust mr davis and who should replace him if he is recalled .
the american civil liberties union had asked for the delay to allow time for the replacement of all punch-card machines , similar to those which produced such controversial results in florida in the 2000 presidential election .
but federal judge stephen wilson rejected arguments that the machines would be so inaccurate as to effectively disenfranchise a part of the electorate .
he said he would not rule against the will of the people by ordering a delay .
correspondents say the ruling removes what could be the final hurdle to the vote going ahead in seven weeks .
taxing times while california 's economic woes and their handling are clearly at the heart of the challenges to mr davis , the possible solutions are much more varied .
gray davis said republicans could win with just a handful of votes mr bustamante said he would raise taxes on alcohol and cigarettes while cutting a controversial hike in car registration fees which is beginning to take effect .
mr schwarzenegger said he would not raise taxes - " the people of california have been punished enough " .
instead , he would order a 60-day audit to identify exactly where the problems were and where savings could be made .
he tackled complaints that his promises were too vague by saying : " before the carping begins about the need for a 25-point plan on each one of those items , let me make clear that these problems were not created in two weeks and we will not be able to solve them in two weeks . "
mr schwarzenegger , who earlier held a meeting with economic advisers including billionaire investor warren buffet and george shultz who was president reagan 's secretary of state , said he would come up with details later .
he went on to say that californians were less concerned by facts and figures than by a desire to see someone make changes .
for his part , mr davis launched his offensive by accusing his opponents of trying to take back control of the state by default .
mr davis was re-elected as governor nine months ago but if voters decide he should be recalled , there are now 135 candidates waiting to take over .
if mr davis is voted out of office , the replacement candidate with the most support will become governor .
" the republicans behind this recall say they want you to oust me for past mistakes , " mr davis said .
" my friends , they do n't give a rip about past mistakes .
this is all about control in the future , seizing back the governor 's chair and believing with so many candidates running they can do it with just a handful of california voters . "
