one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .
shaking things up is exactly what the union set out to do , and that ’ s why despite the criticism ver.di is unwilling to withdraw the spot .
in fact , hagen and other representatives would even like to see the ad broadcast on several channels for a wider reach . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .
companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .

leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.10.2003 auto metaphors fly at franco-german summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france want to tune up europe 's economic engine .
leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations .

they laughed when he told them he did n't have an e-mail address .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.10.2003 auto metaphors fly at franco-german summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france want to tune up europe 's economic engine .
leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .
shaking things up is exactly what the union set out to do , and that ’ s why despite the criticism ver.di is unwilling to withdraw the spot .
in fact , hagen and other representatives would even like to see the ad broadcast on several channels for a wider reach . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .

leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .
shaking things up is exactly what the union set out to do , and that ’ s why despite the criticism ver.di is unwilling to withdraw the spot .
in fact , hagen and other representatives would even like to see the ad broadcast on several channels for a wider reach . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .

unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .
the project helps other refugees get in touch with their families and friends . when the calls home to cameroon started getting too expensive , eben chu 's relatives asked if he could just send an e-mail from germany instead .
they laughed when he told them he did n't have an e-mail address .
but since he is an asylum seeker living in a hostel in the city potsdam , per-minute charges at a local internet café were a luxury that his monthly government stipend wouldn ’ t allow .
he decided to do something about it .
through ads in the local papers , meetings with charities and some old-fashioned networking , chu and group he started , refugees emancipation , managed to get his entire shelter in the city of potsdam online by founding germany ’ s first internet café by and for refugees .
" as asylum-seekers , we are limited in everything , " he said .
" but we were political activists in our own countries , which means we know what it means to have a social relationship . "
wired with a little help from some friends chu ’ s group was surprised by the number of donations it received from local businesses and charities .
the potsdam hostel donated a converted classroom to house the computers and a berlin charity stepped in to pay the group ’ s telephone bill during the first six months of operations .
since then , the internet café has been doing a brisk business .
" from vietnam to afghanistan to africa to latin america , everybody ’ s there and they can get information in their language , " said chu .
" this is just wonderful and exciting to most of the refugees . "
connecting with family , eliminating stress the project is already changing people ’ s lives .
" we ’ re very pleased about everything they ’ ve installed here , " said one african man .
" before , we had to go to the internet café at the central station .
it also cost a euro , which we didn ’ t even have . "
he said the project has helped him get back in touch with his family back in cameroon .
" with the internet i can keep up contact with my family in africa and my friends in the rest of the world .
when you sit down in front of the computer and talk to your family , it helps you get rid of some of the stress , " he said .
though the personal rewards can be huge , adopting the new technology hasn ’ t been as easy for all the residents in the hostel .
to bridge the digital divide , the group is planning to offer computer courses .
in preparation , several of the refugees already took part in a free computer education course organized by students at berlin ’ s technical university .
back to school for many , it was a completely new experience .
at first the students were asked what they wanted to learn , chu recalls .
knowing nothing about computers , they did n't really know where to begin , but " after three months it was just great . "
with their new-found knowledge of computers and the internet , the men and women returned to the hostel and are now sharing what they ’ ve learned with other residents , showing them how to operate computers , find information on the internet and set up an e-mail address .
but for most refugees living in germany , internet access is still impossible or very hard to come by .
chu said refugees emancipation is planning to expand the project other hostels in the region .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .

leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .

unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .
the project helps other refugees get in touch with their families and friends . when the calls home to cameroon started getting too expensive , eben chu 's relatives asked if he could just send an e-mail from germany instead .
they laughed when he told them he did n't have an e-mail address .
but since he is an asylum seeker living in a hostel in the city potsdam , per-minute charges at a local internet café were a luxury that his monthly government stipend wouldn ’ t allow .
he decided to do something about it .
through ads in the local papers , meetings with charities and some old-fashioned networking , chu and group he started , refugees emancipation , managed to get his entire shelter in the city of potsdam online by founding germany ’ s first internet café by and for refugees .
" as asylum-seekers , we are limited in everything , " he said .
" but we were political activists in our own countries , which means we know what it means to have a social relationship . "
wired with a little help from some friends chu ’ s group was surprised by the number of donations it received from local businesses and charities .
the potsdam hostel donated a converted classroom to house the computers and a berlin charity stepped in to pay the group ’ s telephone bill during the first six months of operations .
since then , the internet café has been doing a brisk business .
" from vietnam to afghanistan to africa to latin america , everybody ’ s there and they can get information in their language , " said chu .
" this is just wonderful and exciting to most of the refugees . "
connecting with family , eliminating stress the project is already changing people ’ s lives .
" we ’ re very pleased about everything they ’ ve installed here , " said one african man .
" before , we had to go to the internet café at the central station .
it also cost a euro , which we didn ’ t even have . "
he said the project has helped him get back in touch with his family back in cameroon .
" with the internet i can keep up contact with my family in africa and my friends in the rest of the world .
when you sit down in front of the computer and talk to your family , it helps you get rid of some of the stress , " he said .
though the personal rewards can be huge , adopting the new technology hasn ’ t been as easy for all the residents in the hostel .
to bridge the digital divide , the group is planning to offer computer courses .
in preparation , several of the refugees already took part in a free computer education course organized by students at berlin ’ s technical university .
back to school for many , it was a completely new experience .
at first the students were asked what they wanted to learn , chu recalls .
knowing nothing about computers , they did n't really know where to begin , but " after three months it was just great . "
with their new-found knowledge of computers and the internet , the men and women returned to the hostel and are now sharing what they ’ ve learned with other residents , showing them how to operate computers , find information on the internet and set up an e-mail address .
but for most refugees living in germany , internet access is still impossible or very hard to come by .
chu said refugees emancipation is planning to expand the project other hostels in the region .
" my desire is that all the hostels in brandenburg could have -lrb- access to the -rrb- internet , " he says .
" the internet is not a luxury , " he says . " it ’ s a modern means of communication , which should be accessible .

leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.10.2003 auto metaphors fly at franco-german summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france want to tune up europe 's economic engine .
leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .
shaking things up is exactly what the union set out to do , and that ’ s why despite the criticism ver.di is unwilling to withdraw the spot .
in fact , hagen and other representatives would even like to see the ad broadcast on several channels for a wider reach . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .

unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .
the project helps other refugees get in touch with their families and friends . when the calls home to cameroon started getting too expensive , eben chu 's relatives asked if he could just send an e-mail from germany instead .
they laughed when he told them he did n't have an e-mail address .
but since he is an asylum seeker living in a hostel in the city potsdam , per-minute charges at a local internet café were a luxury that his monthly government stipend wouldn ’ t allow .
he decided to do something about it .
through ads in the local papers , meetings with charities and some old-fashioned networking , chu and group he started , refugees emancipation , managed to get his entire shelter in the city of potsdam online by founding germany ’ s first internet café by and for refugees .
" as asylum-seekers , we are limited in everything , " he said .
" but we were political activists in our own countries , which means we know what it means to have a social relationship . "
wired with a little help from some friends chu ’ s group was surprised by the number of donations it received from local businesses and charities .
the potsdam hostel donated a converted classroom to house the computers and a berlin charity stepped in to pay the group ’ s telephone bill during the first six months of operations .
since then , the internet café has been doing a brisk business .
" from vietnam to afghanistan to africa to latin america , everybody ’ s there and they can get information in their language , " said chu .
" this is just wonderful and exciting to most of the refugees . "
connecting with family , eliminating stress the project is already changing people ’ s lives .
" we ’ re very pleased about everything they ’ ve installed here , " said one african man .
" before , we had to go to the internet café at the central station .
it also cost a euro , which we didn ’ t even have . "
he said the project has helped him get back in touch with his family back in cameroon .
" with the internet i can keep up contact with my family in africa and my friends in the rest of the world .
when you sit down in front of the computer and talk to your family , it helps you get rid of some of the stress , " he said .
though the personal rewards can be huge , adopting the new technology hasn ’ t been as easy for all the residents in the hostel .
to bridge the digital divide , the group is planning to offer computer courses .
in preparation , several of the refugees already took part in a free computer education course organized by students at berlin ’ s technical university .
back to school for many , it was a completely new experience .
at first the students were asked what they wanted to learn , chu recalls .
knowing nothing about computers , they did n't really know where to begin , but " after three months it was just great . "
with their new-found knowledge of computers and the internet , the men and women returned to the hostel and are now sharing what they ’ ve learned with other residents , showing them how to operate computers , find information on the internet and set up an e-mail address .
but for most refugees living in germany , internet access is still impossible or very hard to come by .
chu said refugees emancipation is planning to expand the project other hostels in the region .
" my desire is that all the hostels in brandenburg could have -lrb- access to the -rrb- internet , " he says .
" the internet is not a luxury , " he says . " it ’ s a modern means of communication , which should be accessible .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .

leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations .

meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .

leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .

unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .
the project helps other refugees get in touch with their families and friends . when the calls home to cameroon started getting too expensive , eben chu 's relatives asked if he could just send an e-mail from germany instead .
they laughed when he told them he did n't have an e-mail address .
but since he is an asylum seeker living in a hostel in the city potsdam , per-minute charges at a local internet café were a luxury that his monthly government stipend wouldn ’ t allow .
he decided to do something about it .
through ads in the local papers , meetings with charities and some old-fashioned networking , chu and group he started , refugees emancipation , managed to get his entire shelter in the city of potsdam online by founding germany ’ s first internet café by and for refugees .
" as asylum-seekers , we are limited in everything , " he said .
" but we were political activists in our own countries , which means we know what it means to have a social relationship . "
wired with a little help from some friends chu ’ s group was surprised by the number of donations it received from local businesses and charities .
the potsdam hostel donated a converted classroom to house the computers and a berlin charity stepped in to pay the group ’ s telephone bill during the first six months of operations .
since then , the internet café has been doing a brisk business .
" from vietnam to afghanistan to africa to latin america , everybody ’ s there and they can get information in their language , " said chu .
" this is just wonderful and exciting to most of the refugees . "
connecting with family , eliminating stress the project is already changing people ’ s lives .
" we ’ re very pleased about everything they ’ ve installed here , " said one african man .
" before , we had to go to the internet café at the central station .
it also cost a euro , which we didn ’ t even have . "
he said the project has helped him get back in touch with his family back in cameroon .
" with the internet i can keep up contact with my family in africa and my friends in the rest of the world .
when you sit down in front of the computer and talk to your family , it helps you get rid of some of the stress , " he said .
though the personal rewards can be huge , adopting the new technology hasn ’ t been as easy for all the residents in the hostel .
to bridge the digital divide , the group is planning to offer computer courses .
in preparation , several of the refugees already took part in a free computer education course organized by students at berlin ’ s technical university .
back to school for many , it was a completely new experience .
at first the students were asked what they wanted to learn , chu recalls .
knowing nothing about computers , they did n't really know where to begin , but " after three months it was just great . "
with their new-found knowledge of computers and the internet , the men and women returned to the hostel and are now sharing what they ’ ve learned with other residents , showing them how to operate computers , find information on the internet and set up an e-mail address .
but for most refugees living in germany , internet access is still impossible or very hard to come by .
chu said refugees emancipation is planning to expand the project other hostels in the region .
" my desire is that all the hostels in brandenburg could have -lrb- access to the -rrb- internet , " he says .
" the internet is not a luxury , " he says . " it ’ s a modern means of communication , which should be accessible .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .
shaking things up is exactly what the union set out to do , and that ’ s why despite the criticism ver.di is unwilling to withdraw the spot .
in fact , hagen and other representatives would even like to see the ad broadcast on several channels for a wider reach . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .
shaking things up is exactly what the union set out to do , and that ’ s why despite the criticism ver.di is unwilling to withdraw the spot .
in fact , hagen and other representatives would even like to see the ad broadcast on several channels for a wider reach . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .
companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.10.2003 homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internet café in nairobi : where locals can connect with family in europe .
unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .
the project helps other refugees get in touch with their families and friends . when the calls home to cameroon started getting too expensive , eben chu 's relatives asked if he could just send an e-mail from germany instead .
they laughed when he told them he did n't have an e-mail address .
but since he is an asylum seeker living in a hostel in the city potsdam , per-minute charges at a local internet café were a luxury that his monthly government stipend wouldn ’ t allow .
he decided to do something about it .
through ads in the local papers , meetings with charities and some old-fashioned networking , chu and group he started , refugees emancipation , managed to get his entire shelter in the city of potsdam online by founding germany ’ s first internet café by and for refugees .
" as asylum-seekers , we are limited in everything , " he said .
" but we were political activists in our own countries , which means we know what it means to have a social relationship . "
wired with a little help from some friends chu ’ s group was surprised by the number of donations it received from local businesses and charities .
the potsdam hostel donated a converted classroom to house the computers and a berlin charity stepped in to pay the group ’ s telephone bill during the first six months of operations .
since then , the internet café has been doing a brisk business .
" from vietnam to afghanistan to africa to latin america , everybody ’ s there and they can get information in their language , " said chu .
" this is just wonderful and exciting to most of the refugees . "
connecting with family , eliminating stress the project is already changing people ’ s lives .
" we ’ re very pleased about everything they ’ ve installed here , " said one african man .
" before , we had to go to the internet café at the central station .
it also cost a euro , which we didn ’ t even have . "
he said the project has helped him get back in touch with his family back in cameroon .
" with the internet i can keep up contact with my family in africa and my friends in the rest of the world .
when you sit down in front of the computer and talk to your family , it helps you get rid of some of the stress , " he said .
though the personal rewards can be huge , adopting the new technology hasn ’ t been as easy for all the residents in the hostel .
to bridge the digital divide , the group is planning to offer computer courses .
in preparation , several of the refugees already took part in a free computer education course organized by students at berlin ’ s technical university .
back to school for many , it was a completely new experience .
at first the students were asked what they wanted to learn , chu recalls .
knowing nothing about computers , they did n't really know where to begin , but " after three months it was just great . "
with their new-found knowledge of computers and the internet , the men and women returned to the hostel and are now sharing what they ’ ve learned with other residents , showing them how to operate computers , find information on the internet and set up an e-mail address .
but for most refugees living in germany , internet access is still impossible or very hard to come by .
chu said refugees emancipation is planning to expand the project other hostels in the region .
" my desire is that all the hostels in brandenburg could have -lrb- access to the -rrb- internet , " he says .
" the internet is not a luxury , " he says . " it ’ s a modern means of communication , which should be accessible . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback staying in touch with relatives back home can be an expensive and unaffordable proposition for refugees .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .
shaking things up is exactly what the union set out to do , and that ’ s why despite the criticism ver.di is unwilling to withdraw the spot .
in fact , hagen and other representatives would even like to see the ad broadcast on several channels for a wider reach . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .
companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand .

they laughed when he told them he did n't have an e-mail address .
but since he is an asylum seeker living in a hostel in the city potsdam , per-minute charges at a local internet café were a luxury that his monthly government stipend wouldn ’ t allow .
he decided to do something about it .

leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.10.2003 auto metaphors fly at franco-german summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france want to tune up europe 's economic engine .
leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .
shaking things up is exactly what the union set out to do , and that ’ s why despite the criticism ver.di is unwilling to withdraw the spot .
in fact , hagen and other representatives would even like to see the ad broadcast on several channels for a wider reach . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .
companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand .

chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .

" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .

leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations .

leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations .

the school came under investigation earlier this year for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and authorities were on the verge of shutting it down .
under the terms of the new agreement , the academy may neither organize external activities nor allow people into the school who could have contacts to terrorist or extremist groups .
the school 's principle will have to dismiss teachers who have propagated violence or aggressive fundamentalism .
the authorities also said they would examine whether there were sufficient grounds for the 465 pupils to attend the school rather than a german school .
more than 200 of the academy 's students have german passports .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .
shaking things up is exactly what the union set out to do , and that ’ s why despite the criticism ver.di is unwilling to withdraw the spot .
in fact , hagen and other representatives would even like to see the ad broadcast on several channels for a wider reach . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .
companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand .

the school came under investigation earlier this year for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and authorities were on the verge of shutting it down .
under the terms of the new agreement , the academy may neither organize external activities nor allow people into the school who could have contacts to terrorist or extremist groups .
the school 's principle will have to dismiss teachers who have propagated violence or aggressive fundamentalism .
the authorities also said they would examine whether there were sufficient grounds for the 465 pupils to attend the school rather than a german school .
more than 200 of the academy 's students have german passports .
a teacher was suspended after reportedly calling for a holy war against the west in friday prayers at the facility 's mosque . more briefs 28.10.2003 -pipe- opposition defections boost chances for tax cut 28.10.2003 -pipe- degussa regrets exclusion from holocaust memorial 27.10.2003 -pipe- greens call on u.n.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.10.2003 union 's suicide ads come under fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the disputed ad campaign .
one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .
shaking things up is exactly what the union set out to do , and that ’ s why despite the criticism ver.di is unwilling to withdraw the spot .
in fact , hagen and other representatives would even like to see the ad broadcast on several channels for a wider reach . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .
companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand .

one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .
shaking things up is exactly what the union set out to do , and that ’ s why despite the criticism ver.di is unwilling to withdraw the spot .
in fact , hagen and other representatives would even like to see the ad broadcast on several channels for a wider reach . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .

the school came under investigation earlier this year for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and authorities were on the verge of shutting it down .
under the terms of the new agreement , the academy may neither organize external activities nor allow people into the school who could have contacts to terrorist or extremist groups .
the school 's principle will have to dismiss teachers who have propagated violence or aggressive fundamentalism .
the authorities also said they would examine whether there were sufficient grounds for the 465 pupils to attend the school rather than a german school .
more than 200 of the academy 's students have german passports .
a teacher was suspended after reportedly calling for a holy war against the west in friday prayers at the facility 's mosque . more briefs 28.10.2003 -pipe- opposition defections boost chances for tax cut 28.10.2003 -pipe- degussa regrets exclusion from holocaust memorial 27.10.2003 -pipe- greens call on u.n.

leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations .

the school came under investigation earlier this year for alleged ties to the terrorist network al qaeda and authorities were on the verge of shutting it down .
under the terms of the new agreement , the academy may neither organize external activities nor allow people into the school who could have contacts to terrorist or extremist groups .
the school 's principle will have to dismiss teachers who have propagated violence or aggressive fundamentalism .
the authorities also said they would examine whether there were sufficient grounds for the 465 pupils to attend the school rather than a german school .
more than 200 of the academy 's students have german passports .
a teacher was suspended after reportedly calling for a holy war against the west in friday prayers at the facility 's mosque . more briefs 28.10.2003 -pipe- opposition defections boost chances for tax cut 28.10.2003 -pipe- degussa regrets exclusion from holocaust memorial 27.10.2003 -pipe- greens call on u.n.

he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations .

unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .
the project helps other refugees get in touch with their families and friends . when the calls home to cameroon started getting too expensive , eben chu 's relatives asked if he could just send an e-mail from germany instead .
they laughed when he told them he did n't have an e-mail address .
but since he is an asylum seeker living in a hostel in the city potsdam , per-minute charges at a local internet café were a luxury that his monthly government stipend wouldn ’ t allow .
he decided to do something about it .
through ads in the local papers , meetings with charities and some old-fashioned networking , chu and group he started , refugees emancipation , managed to get his entire shelter in the city of potsdam online by founding germany ’ s first internet café by and for refugees .
" as asylum-seekers , we are limited in everything , " he said .
" but we were political activists in our own countries , which means we know what it means to have a social relationship . "
wired with a little help from some friends chu ’ s group was surprised by the number of donations it received from local businesses and charities .
the potsdam hostel donated a converted classroom to house the computers and a berlin charity stepped in to pay the group ’ s telephone bill during the first six months of operations .
since then , the internet café has been doing a brisk business .
" from vietnam to afghanistan to africa to latin america , everybody ’ s there and they can get information in their language , " said chu .

he said the project has helped him get back in touch with his family back in cameroon .
" with the internet i can keep up contact with my family in africa and my friends in the rest of the world .
when you sit down in front of the computer and talk to your family , it helps you get rid of some of the stress , " he said .
though the personal rewards can be huge , adopting the new technology hasn ’ t been as easy for all the residents in the hostel .
to bridge the digital divide , the group is planning to offer computer courses .
in preparation , several of the refugees already took part in a free computer education course organized by students at berlin ’ s technical university .
back to school for many , it was a completely new experience .
at first the students were asked what they wanted to learn , chu recalls .
knowing nothing about computers , they did n't really know where to begin , but " after three months it was just great . "
with their new-found knowledge of computers and the internet , the men and women returned to the hostel and are now sharing what they ’ ve learned with other residents , showing them how to operate computers , find information on the internet and set up an e-mail address .

leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .

leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.10.2003 auto metaphors fly at franco-german summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and france want to tune up europe 's economic engine .
leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year . german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jean-pierre raffarin met in the southeastern french city of poitiers on monday evening for a regular series of franco-german consultations .
but the meeting ’ s agenda could not have been more different .
rather than the usual high-level diplomatic talks , the summit focused on ways to increase regional cooperation between the two countries .
the two-day summit marks the first time senior officials from germany ’ s 16 states have met with their counterparts from france ’ s 22 regions .
schröder and raffarin have announced joint growth programs intended to help germany and france lower their budget deficits , which are expected to exceed european union limits both this year and next .
" we say to our friends in brussels that france and germany will pursue growth policies together and nobody will come between us , and nobody really wants to anyway , " schröder said monday .
" we are signaling in friendship and mindful of our commitments our common will -lrb- to privilege growth -rrb- , directed against nobody , in favor of both our countries and therefore europe as a whole . "
schröder also defined the agenda for what he described as the most-important dimensions of foreign policy for the franco-german partnership in the coming year .
he said the team must work toward facilitating peace in the world , to promote the further expansion and unification of the european union " for our good old europe , " and to surmount the economic difficulties in both germany and france that have placed them at the bottom of the eu heap in economic growth despite their status as europe 's biggest economies and most-populous lands .
meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poitiers french president raffarin initiated the idea for the summit in his hometown .
before his rise to the presidency , raffarin served as president of the poitou-charente region , and regional elections are slated for poitiers in march .
raffarin ’ s photo ops with prominent foreign politicians will do little to harm local elections .
but raffarin is looking for more than airtime in poitiers .
he ’ s a fervent proponent of decentralizing the french government with its complete focus in paris .
further limiting paris ‘ power is a political labor of love , one he has pursued relentlessly despite opposition within his own ranks .
his first and only success , so far , in that regard came in march , as he succeeded in anchoring the regions in the constitution .
the constitution now states that the french government is " decentralized , " and the devolution gives regions greater autonomy .
france is discussing with germany ways it might model its devolution of regions on the federalized system of states in germany , the french news agency afp reports .
currently the regions have more power over economic development , tourism , roads , culture and extended education , but raffarin is seeking greater delegation of authority .
but few observers believe the french regions will become as powerful as the german states , or bundesländer as they are called here , not even raffarin .
" a french region will never be completely comparable to a german land , " he said .
still , the changes do make it easier for french regions to work more closely with german states , and now raffarin is calling for the successful ties between the highest levels of the german and french governments to be replicated and the regional and local level .
the governments intend to sign agreements in poitiers that will increase ties and improve cross-border mobility between regions .
exchanges and regional partnerships concrete proposals include closer cooperation in research , education and the trades through teacher , student and worker exchanges .
the leaders also called for a 50 percent increase in the number of german and french students who learn each others ‘ languages within 10 years , as well as the drafting of a common history book to be used in schools in both countries .
the leaders signed the first of a series of such contracts on monday , inking a partnership deal between france ’ s poitou-charentes region and the german state of mecklenburg west-pomerania .
a day earlier , raffarin also sought to assuage concerns of eu countries that fear the german-franco partnership has grown too powerful .
in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper , he extended an open invitation for other eu members to participate in the regular berlin-paris consultations .
" the franco-german relationship is a motor , " he said , " but we are ready to add other cylinders . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.10.2003 union 's suicide ads come under fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the disputed ad campaign .
one of germany ’ s largest unions is reaping serious criticism after running television ads showing young people about to commit suicide .
the ad calls for more apprenticeships for hundreds of thousands of jobless youth . if the job outlook for young people is as bad as the trade and services union ver.di depicts in a new television spot , then germany has some serious problems .
to a soundtrack of hard-core music , the one-minute ad shows teens preparing to commit various forms of suicide .
one girl slings a rope over a rafter , another presses a razor blade into her wrist - the camera then shifts to the sink full of water as a drop of blood trickles down .
in another scene , a boy pulls a gun out of a desk and puts it in his mouth .
the screen goes black at the end and a second later white writing informs viewers that the country is lacking more than 150,000 trainee positions , leaving hundreds of thousands of school graduates without a job .
" youth need a future , youth need prospects , " is the tag line on the ad , and the union bosses are very happy with it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di ausbildungsplätze many germans and top-ranking politicians quite clearly are not .
since the ad started airing on the video music channel viva over the weekend , the criticism has come pouring in .
spot " aggressive and excessive " " the situation in the apprenticeship market is dramatic , " said klaus börger , berlin 's education senator .
" but one should stay grounded , and not employ such methods . "
angela merkel of the conservative christian democrats , echoed the thoughts of many angry bild readers , who wrote in to germany ’ s mass daily on monday to complain about the tastelessness of the ad .
" the spot is aggressive and excessive , " said merkel , one of the government ’ s biggest critics when it comes to the lack of trainee positions .
given the economic malaise germany finds itself in , industry has been forced to cut back on the number of apprenticeships and trainee positions in order to save money .
but critics accuse industry of turning its back on a tradition of vocational training that has contributed heavily to the country 's reputation for producing some of the highest-quality products in the world .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government has issued several ultimatums demanding companies do more to help out germany ’ s jobless youth .
earlier this month union , industry and government representatives struck a compromise which foresaw fines if companies didn ’ t create thousands of positions by the end of the year .
in an effort to increase public pressure on industry and ride the general wave of resentment with the government 's handling of the dire situation , ver.di took its controversial campaign to the airwaves .
provocation attracts attention mark hagen , a representative for the union ’ s youth section , admitted to dw-radio that the ad is provocative .
" we ’ ve tried to shake awake german society and politicians and the entire economy who should be responsible for providing enough training placements for all the young people . "
" we ’ ve been trying to get politics and the economy to do something ... for years and years by different means , " he said , but so far nothing has changed .
that ’ s why ver.di decided to adopt more drastic means to call attention to the lack of trainee positions .
" those who find the film too dramatic , or think it encourages suicide , need to think : it is the lack of a future or a perspective that fills young people with doubt , " ver.di said in a union statement over the weekend after its representatives approved airing the film .
union " underestimates effect " of ad those who work with teens and young people who have contemplated suicide said the union ’ s message does n't get past recommendations on how to kill yourself .
" they underestimate the actual effect of such a spot , " psychologist franz-josef kimmig told dw-world .
for someone who is emotionally stable , the video will do nothing more than shock , said kimmig , who counsels young people who 've attempted suicide and gives advice to their friends and relatives .
" but those who are unstable , who already have considered suicide , may be pushed to take that step , " he said .
recipe for suicide " what i find especially bad is that the video clearly shows how to commit suicide " said kimmig .
" you can almost imitate the techniques . "
but hagen disagreed .
he said the union has carefully considered the campaign and tested it on young people before airing it .
" the largest part of the young people we showed it to ... understood quite well what we wanted .
and they said , yes , it is a very harsh way to show this topic , but it ’ s correct in the content and it is definitely a way to reach young people and just to shake the tree a little bit , " hagen explained .
shaking things up is exactly what the union set out to do , and that ’ s why despite the criticism ver.di is unwilling to withdraw the spot .
in fact , hagen and other representatives would even like to see the ad broadcast on several channels for a wider reach . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .
companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand .

unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .
the project helps other refugees get in touch with their families and friends . when the calls home to cameroon started getting too expensive , eben chu 's relatives asked if he could just send an e-mail from germany instead .
they laughed when he told them he did n't have an e-mail address .
but since he is an asylum seeker living in a hostel in the city potsdam , per-minute charges at a local internet café were a luxury that his monthly government stipend wouldn ’ t allow .
he decided to do something about it .
through ads in the local papers , meetings with charities and some old-fashioned networking , chu and group he started , refugees emancipation , managed to get his entire shelter in the city of potsdam online by founding germany ’ s first internet café by and for refugees .
" as asylum-seekers , we are limited in everything , " he said .
" but we were political activists in our own countries , which means we know what it means to have a social relationship . "
wired with a little help from some friends chu ’ s group was surprised by the number of donations it received from local businesses and charities .
the potsdam hostel donated a converted classroom to house the computers and a berlin charity stepped in to pay the group ’ s telephone bill during the first six months of operations .
since then , the internet café has been doing a brisk business .
" from vietnam to afghanistan to africa to latin america , everybody ’ s there and they can get information in their language , " said chu .
" this is just wonderful and exciting to most of the refugees . "
connecting with family , eliminating stress the project is already changing people ’ s lives .
" we ’ re very pleased about everything they ’ ve installed here , " said one african man .
" before , we had to go to the internet café at the central station .
it also cost a euro , which we didn ’ t even have . "
he said the project has helped him get back in touch with his family back in cameroon .
" with the internet i can keep up contact with my family in africa and my friends in the rest of the world .
when you sit down in front of the computer and talk to your family , it helps you get rid of some of the stress , " he said .
though the personal rewards can be huge , adopting the new technology hasn ’ t been as easy for all the residents in the hostel .
to bridge the digital divide , the group is planning to offer computer courses .
in preparation , several of the refugees already took part in a free computer education course organized by students at berlin ’ s technical university .
back to school for many , it was a completely new experience .
at first the students were asked what they wanted to learn , chu recalls .
knowing nothing about computers , they did n't really know where to begin , but " after three months it was just great . "
with their new-found knowledge of computers and the internet , the men and women returned to the hostel and are now sharing what they ’ ve learned with other residents , showing them how to operate computers , find information on the internet and set up an e-mail address .
but for most refugees living in germany , internet access is still impossible or very hard to come by .
chu said refugees emancipation is planning to expand the project other hostels in the region .
" my desire is that all the hostels in brandenburg could have -lrb- access to the -rrb- internet , " he says .
" the internet is not a luxury , " he says . " it ’ s a modern means of communication , which should be accessible .

the shares - available only to chinese buyers - should go on sale next week , with the proceeds used to pay for the massive generators which began generating electricity earlier this year .
the flotation , which aims to raise 9.83bn yuan -lrb- $ 1.2bn ; £ 700m -rrb- , was meant to start in september but was delayed because regulators felt there were already too many share sales stacked up that month .
even so , news of the date for the public offering impacted markets in china , with the shanghai composite index edging down 0.33 % .
there is little doubt that the shares will sell out several times over .

the glasgow primary care nhs trust wants to base the service in an existing surgery in the city .
the proposal is part of a drive to provide medical care for patients with " challenging behaviour " .
gps can strike patients from their list if they behave violently , but doctors in glasgow will soon be able to transfer them to the new service .
amid claims of harassment of doctors , a new gps ' contract is calling on health boards to provide a service to care for such patients wherever necessary .
the contract is being implemented via the primary medical services bill which is currently passing through the scottish parliament .
patients need to be treated even if they are violent and we need to provide services for them scottish executive earlier this month the british medical association claimed violence at work is a problem for one in two doctors in scotland , with one in three doctors experiencing violence over the last year .
the new service in glasgow will provide the facilities for doctors to treat violent patients .
a spokesman for the glasgow primary care nhs trust said the level of security and training required would be decided after a surgery is chosen and a full safety assessment carried out .
the surgery may include a security guard to patrol the premises , cctv to film the consultation area and a chaperone to stay with the gp at all times .
a spokeswoman for the scottish executive welcomed the initiative .
" patients need to be treated even if they are violent and we need to provide services for them , " she said .
following the bma report , unions joined health workers in calling on the executive to do more to prevent violent attacks on scotland 's doctors .

the british dental association -lrb- bda -rrb- has warned there is a severe shortage of dentists in wales - and that the situation will not improve without financial support to persuade new practices to open up .
despite the long waiting list for nhs dental places in wales , a series of special road shows is visiting towns this week , with the aim of giving people more information about dental services available .
the road shows are being organised by the dental practice board , the statutory body which administers the general dental services of the nhs and is responsible for monitoring the quality of nhs dentistry .
crisis is almost an appropriate word stuart geddes , british dental association a three-day awareness initiative starting on tuesday will give advice to people in newport in south wales , llandrindod wells in mid wales , and caernarfon in the north , about the kind of dental skills they can gain access to in their areas .
the extent of the shortage of dentists in some parts of rural wales became clear in july when 600 people queued to take up the nhs places on offer at a new practice in carmarthen .
hundreds more had to be turned away .
in the last few weeks , another new dentist opened up in the county , but the location was kept secret for fear of similar scenes .
on tuesday night , dental experts will be on hand in newport to give face-to-face advice in the first of the series of road shows .
in august it was revealed that community dental services were struggling because newly-qualified dentists , crippled by debt , were avoiding nhs work .
a british dental association -lrb- bda -rrb- survey revealed that young dentists were opting for better-paid private work , rather than nhs jobs in clinics , in a bid to make money quickly to pay off their debts .
over 600 people queued in an attempt to get on a carmarthen nhs dentist 's list speaking to bbc radio wales , stuart geddes , secretary of the bda in wales , said incentives should be given to dentists in key areas where severe shortages were identified .
" one thing we have to do is to look at where we really need dentists , and then target those areas , and make them accessible to dentists , " said mr geddes , who practises in usk .
" dentists provide all their own equipment , they pay their own staff , they buy their own premises .
they fund the complete set-up .
" some help with starting up would be very useful . "
asked how he would describe the state of the dental industry in wales , mr geddes said : " crisis is almost an appropriate word .
it is certainly under stress , and , at the moment , the service is very much over-stretched .
" we find ourselves being criticised because we are not delivering the service to patients that patients want - and , at the end of the day , that 's the priority .
" we have got to look at the people in wales and we have got to make sure they maintain good dental health . "
meanwhile , a week in week out programme for bbc one wales reveals on tuesday that the number of gp vacancies in wales is at an all-time high .
there are currently 190 posts which need filling - almost a 10 % vacancy rate .
there is more on nhs staff shortages on week in week out on tuesday - bbc one wales at 2235 gmt - when the team investigates why wales needs 6,000 more nurses and 700 more doctors .

" dentists provide all their own equipment , they pay their own staff , they buy their own premises .
they fund the complete set-up .
" some help with starting up would be very useful . "
asked how he would describe the state of the dental industry in wales , mr geddes said : " crisis is almost an appropriate word .
it is certainly under stress , and , at the moment , the service is very much over-stretched .
" we find ourselves being criticised because we are not delivering the service to patients that patients want - and , at the end of the day , that 's the priority .
" we have got to look at the people in wales and we have got to make sure they maintain good dental health . "
meanwhile , a week in week out programme for bbc one wales reveals on tuesday that the number of gp vacancies in wales is at an all-time high .
there are currently 190 posts which need filling - almost a 10 % vacancy rate .
there is more on nhs staff shortages on week in week out on tuesday - bbc one wales at 2235 gmt - when the team investigates why wales needs 6,000 more nurses and 700 more doctors .

despite the long waiting list for nhs dental places in wales , a series of special road shows is visiting towns this week , with the aim of giving people more information about dental services available .

the extent of the shortage of dentists in some parts of rural wales became clear in july when 600 people queued to take up the nhs places on offer at a new practice in carmarthen .
hundreds more had to be turned away .

bbc news online looks at the events that made such radical action necessary .
what is the peacekeepers ' mandate ?
the troops and police have provided back-up to help the solomon islands security forces combat the large number of rebels and militiamen roaming the country .
troops have been given the right to use reasonable force , and are immune from prosecution in relation to action taken in the course of their duties .
the mission was formally approved by both the solomons government and the islands ' parliament .
which countries make up the force ?
operation helpem fren - pidgin for " help a friend " - has been endorsed by the 16-nation pacific forum .
australia , new zealand , fiji , papua new guinea , tonga and samoa all agreed to make military and police contributions .
australia has contributed the bulk of the 2,225-strong force .
it has sent an estimated 1,500 troops to the solomons , together with 155 police and 90 protection officers .
why is australia so keen on the force ?
australia has often shied away from intervening in the affairs of its pacific neighbours - a policy which dates back to the 1970s , when the islands began to gain independence .
canberra wanted to avoid accusations of neo-colonialism , and concentrate on its own internal security .
but since the bali bombings last october , and the 11 september attacks on the united states , canberra has become increasingly worried about the threat posed by international terrorism .
australia and its neighbours are concerned that the solomons archipelago could become a haven for terrorists , drug dealers and money launderers .
the legacy of ignoring the plight of another impoverished pacific island , nauru , may also be influencing canberra 's decision .
nauru - the world 's smallest independent republic - has been accused by the united states of selling large numbers of fake passports and laundering billions of dollars for international gangs .
what is the current situation in the solomons ?
violence has been rife , amid worries that the country was threatening to spiral into full-scale anarchy .
while the capital , honiara , is relatively calm , the countryside has been wild and lawless .
armed gangs and hostage-takers have roamed the country , and more than 30 people have already been killed this year , including an australian missionary .
the violence has almost bankrupted the country 's 450,000 inhabitants , most of whom live at subsistence level .
what has caused the violence ?
today 's problems stem from long-term tensions between the isatabu , the indigenous population of the main island , guadalcanal , and the malaitans from the neighbouring island of malaita .
both groups are ethnic melanesians , but they share neither culture nor language .
large numbers of malaitans came to guadalcanal in search of work , and came to dominate the economy , creating resentment .
fighting broke out in 1998 , when the rebel isatabu freedom movement began to force malaitans off their island .
around 20,000 people had to abandon their homes .
but a rival militia group , the malaitan eagle force , teamed up with a large number of the country 's police to stage a coup in june 2000 , which forced the prime minister to resign .
an australian-brokered peace deal called the townsville accord was signed in october 2000 , officially ending hostilities .
why has the peace deal not worked ?
after the peace deal had been signed , the government was largely left alone to implement its fledgling agreement .
a plea for further assistance from canberra was denied , and a complete cessation of violence has never been fully achieved .
lawlessness and corruption have continued unabated .
the biggest threat to the government is probably an isatabu militia leader , harold keke , who refused to recognise the peace deal .
he stands accused of killing a government minister last year , as well as being linked to a spate of other murders near his stronghold on guadalcanal 's weather coast .
he surrendered to the peacekeepers on 13 august , leading to hopes that the violence would soon be stopped .

bbc news online looks at the events that made such radical action necessary .
what is the peacekeepers ' mandate ?
the troops and police have provided back-up to help the solomon islands security forces combat the large number of rebels and militiamen roaming the country .
troops have been given the right to use reasonable force , and are immune from prosecution in relation to action taken in the course of their duties .
the mission was formally approved by both the solomons government and the islands ' parliament .
which countries make up the force ?
operation helpem fren - pidgin for " help a friend " - has been endorsed by the 16-nation pacific forum .
australia , new zealand , fiji , papua new guinea , tonga and samoa all agreed to make military and police contributions .
australia has contributed the bulk of the 2,225-strong force .
it has sent an estimated 1,500 troops to the solomons , together with 155 police and 90 protection officers .
why is australia so keen on the force ?
australia has often shied away from intervening in the affairs of its pacific neighbours - a policy which dates back to the 1970s , when the islands began to gain independence .
canberra wanted to avoid accusations of neo-colonialism , and concentrate on its own internal security .
but since the bali bombings last october , and the 11 september attacks on the united states , canberra has become increasingly worried about the threat posed by international terrorism .
australia and its neighbours are concerned that the solomons archipelago could become a haven for terrorists , drug dealers and money launderers .
the legacy of ignoring the plight of another impoverished pacific island , nauru , may also be influencing canberra 's decision .
nauru - the world 's smallest independent republic - has been accused by the united states of selling large numbers of fake passports and laundering billions of dollars for international gangs .
what is the current situation in the solomons ?
violence has been rife , amid worries that the country was threatening to spiral into full-scale anarchy .
while the capital , honiara , is relatively calm , the countryside has been wild and lawless .
armed gangs and hostage-takers have roamed the country , and more than 30 people have already been killed this year , including an australian missionary .
the violence has almost bankrupted the country 's 450,000 inhabitants , most of whom live at subsistence level .
what has caused the violence ?
today 's problems stem from long-term tensions between the isatabu , the indigenous population of the main island , guadalcanal , and the malaitans from the neighbouring island of malaita .
both groups are ethnic melanesians , but they share neither culture nor language .
large numbers of malaitans came to guadalcanal in search of work , and came to dominate the economy , creating resentment .
fighting broke out in 1998 , when the rebel isatabu freedom movement began to force malaitans off their island .
around 20,000 people had to abandon their homes .
but a rival militia group , the malaitan eagle force , teamed up with a large number of the country 's police to stage a coup in june 2000 , which forced the prime minister to resign .
an australian-brokered peace deal called the townsville accord was signed in october 2000 , officially ending hostilities .
why has the peace deal not worked ?
after the peace deal had been signed , the government was largely left alone to implement its fledgling agreement .
a plea for further assistance from canberra was denied , and a complete cessation of violence has never been fully achieved .
lawlessness and corruption have continued unabated .

the club reported pre-tax losses of £ 49.5m -lrb- $ 82.6m -rrb- , which amounted to £ 25.4m before transfers were taken into account .
today 's announcement to the stock exchange also confirmed that trevor birch will become chief executive on november 1 .
it is understood the former chelsea chief will take over the day-to-day running of the club .
the move will leave chairman professor john mckenzie free to concentrate on resolving the elland road club 's finances .
despite a year of frantic cost-cutting and players sales , leeds ' debt rose slightly to £ 78m .
costs cut but the process has seen the club 's assets stripped - with their value falling to just over £ 60m from £ 109m last year .
why does everybody always want to knock leeds down all the time ?
we have turned the corner and we are on our way back prof john mckenzie , leeds chairman prof mckenzie has already implemented a number of redundancies in a bid to save £ 5m a year - but the one-off costs linked to that and paying off former manager terry venables cost the club £ 7.2m.
prof mckenzie said : " we have taken £ 20m of costs out of the business and rebuilt the management team .
" as such , it is now possible to begin to look forward with some confidence . "
he added that leeds should move into profit after the current financial year , provided the club did well in the premier league .
second from bottom in the english top flight , the club also said turnover fell by 21 % to £ 64m , while its debt stood at £ 78m , from £ 77.9m a year ago .
the club blamed 36 % fall in television income and a 9 % decline in television and merchandising revenues .
despite seeing the likes of rio ferdinand , jonathan woodgate , robbie fowler , robbie keane , lee bowyer and olivier dacourt leave during the past 12 months , the club 's wages bill rose by £ 3m .
' corner turned ' meanwhile , it also made a loss of £ 17m in player trading .
prof mckenzie told bbc radio 5 live : " why does everybody always want to knock leeds down all the time ?
we have turned the corner and we are on our way back .
" there will yet another opportunity for fans and others to invest in the first part of next year .
" we will not sell a player unless they ask to go and that will only be when the price is then right .
the key is whether they want to go or not . "
on mr birch 's appointment , he added : " he brings considerable talent and expertise .
this is the first step of a turnaround of a difficult situation . "

the club reported pre-tax losses of £ 49.5m -lrb- $ 82.6m -rrb- , which amounted to £ 25.4m before transfers were taken into account .
today 's announcement to the stock exchange also confirmed that trevor birch will become chief executive on november 1 .
it is understood the former chelsea chief will take over the day-to-day running of the club .
the move will leave chairman professor john mckenzie free to concentrate on resolving the elland road club 's finances .
despite a year of frantic cost-cutting and players sales , leeds ' debt rose slightly to £ 78m .
costs cut but the process has seen the club 's assets stripped - with their value falling to just over £ 60m from £ 109m last year .
why does everybody always want to knock leeds down all the time ?
we have turned the corner and we are on our way back prof john mckenzie , leeds chairman prof mckenzie has already implemented a number of redundancies in a bid to save £ 5m a year - but the one-off costs linked to that and paying off former manager terry venables cost the club £ 7.2m.
prof mckenzie said : " we have taken £ 20m of costs out of the business and rebuilt the management team .
" as such , it is now possible to begin to look forward with some confidence . "
he added that leeds should move into profit after the current financial year , provided the club did well in the premier league .
second from bottom in the english top flight , the club also said turnover fell by 21 % to £ 64m , while its debt stood at £ 78m , from £ 77.9m a year ago .
the club blamed 36 % fall in television income and a 9 % decline in television and merchandising revenues .

the market - the biggest in uganda - is awash with bright bursts of colour from cloth , food and crafts .
anzo told bbc world service 's masterpiece programme her creations were inspired by " all the shades , colours , mostly ugandan items - especially the foodstuffs . "
these include coffee , cinnamon , tea , and beans .
" the coffee 's really nice , it 's good to work with , the colours are good . "
clothes from porridge anzo 's clothes are bright and flowing - a reflection , she said , of life in one of africa 's most vibrant cities .
" kampala 's favourite colours are bright - bright shining colours , because kampala is quite tropical , and because of that we tend to wear friendly colours , colours that hug us during all seasons .
" that 's mostly the orange , lime green .
then a few people tend to go into earthy colours - especially foreigners .
most of my foreign clients go into earthy colours , like coffee brown , cinnamon - just like on sale . "
bizarrely , some of anzo 's designs are not only inspired by foodstuffs - they are made from them too .
for example , some of the clothes designed in her studio are made from porridge .
" the fabric will be plain , and when they make the porridge they will pour it on it , and then sweep it .
as they sweep , they pour the dye on it as well , " she explained .
" that way a beautiful shape comes about . "
take a picture tour round kampala and see what makes the city tick in pictures anzo said that while class was a great dividing factor within kampala society , her philosophy was to try and " reflect us all as one . "
" i try to relate to the ugandan people ... there is a lot of inspiration here , " she said .
she added that she also wanted to modernise african clothing .
" what i try to do is get away from the traditional way of working with african fabrics , " she said .
" i use local fabrics , but i design something contemporary - something really trendy - out of it . "
but she also stressed she was highly committed to the ugandan theme - which want down to the choice of models who wear her creations .
" in recreating my models , i pay attention to the idea of beauty as seen through the ugandan and african eye , " she said .
" that means we do have slender models - the kind that the international market in europe would prefer working with - but at the same time we have the full figure , the plus-size models , that relate to our ugandan people . "

the area 's 40 commercially owned theatres require the cash over 15 years to refurbish outdated victorian buildings , the theatres trust said .
theatregoers would not put up for much longer with unsuitable venues built for audiences 100 years ago , it added .
" without an investment , the prospects are bleak , " the report 's authors warned on tuesday .
most buildings still reflect a period when audiences were segregated into different classes theatres trust " the renaissance of the west end can only be brought about by refurbishing the buildings we already have , " they said .
" most theatre buildings still reflect the conventions of a period when theatre audiences were segregated into different classes , when decent conditions were only provided for a minority of the audience , and when theatre-goers were physically smaller . "
audiences could not be expected to tolerate such conditions , said the report .
impresario sir cameron mackintosh is building a new theatre " sooner or later a major problem at one of the theatres will force a closure .
the smaller playhouses will simply become too expensive to maintain . "
the trust said most subsidised theatres had received national lottery cash and there was now " a marked imbalance between the two sectors " .
some £ 48m is recouped each year by the treasury from vat on ticket sales , while customers spent about £ 789m in 2001 for tickets , transport , accommodation and restaurant visits , the report added .
earlier this year impresario sir cameron mackintosh announced he was ploughing £ 35m into redeveloping his theatres and building a new one , the sondheim theatre .
