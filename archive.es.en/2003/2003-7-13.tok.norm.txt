munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .
it is located at the confluence of the alster and elbe rivers , and has a direct link to the north sea some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- downstream .
it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .
though by no means pretty in the traditional sense , it ’ s certainly worth a visit , if only to appreciate its size and scale .
huge container ships bound for some exotic destination float by and a variety of aromas - flowers , coffee , spices - waft from the warehouses lining the shores . located at the base of the crescent-shaped new city -lrb- which is divided from the crescent-shaped old city by the elbe river -rrb- the harbor covers more than 12 percent of hamburg , and 78 million tons of goods pass through it every year . … but not a drop to drink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water , water everywhere ...
even away from the harbor , water is everywhere in hamburg .
foghorns can be heard downtown ; shrieking sea gulls and an ever-present sea breeze enhance the maritime feeling .
the rivers elbe , alster and bille all traverse the city , creating 64 kilometers of canals requiring 2,500 bridges , giving the city its nickname " venice of the north . " the perimeter of the inner alster can be walked in about a half hour , and visitors can either rent a boat to explore the enormous outer alster , or simply sit at one of the casual dockside cafes that line its shores . in the heart of the new city is the grand church of saint michael , referred to by locals as just " michael . "
the distinctive 134-meter -lrb- 440-foot -rrb- baroque spire is hard to miss and the external beauty gives an idea of the gleaming elegance on the inside . saint michael 's tower and the many other spires and domes that dot the skyline in the old and new city , among them the st. petrikirche and the jakobkirche , are relatively young by european standards .
the great fire of 1842 destroyed a third of hamburg , but it quickly rose from the ashes , rebuilt itself and reclaimed its title as one of europe 's top ports . deichstrasse , with its impressively restored row of 17th and 18th century buildings , is one of the few surviving streets in the old city where you can see hamburg as it was in pre-industrial times .
a stroll along the impressive facades , which reach right to the water ’ s edge , is a reminder of just how tightly shipping and trade were once tied to the life of the city . the wild mile and its opposite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in hamburg is legendary a reporter once asked john lennon what it was like growing up in liverpool , and he replied , " i did n't grow up in liverpool , i grew up in hamburg . "
and of course , the city ’ s greatest international recognition comes as a result of its being the place where the beatles ’ career took off . the " fab four " played in clubs on the notorious reeperbahn , a lively , half-kilometer long strip of bars and sex shops in the st. pauli district that has since become hamburg ’ s top attraction .
one of europe ’ s largest red-light districts , the reeperbahn innocently got its name from the rope makers -lrb- rope is " reep " in the local low-german dialect -rrb- who used to live in the area and pull their long cords of rope down the street . today the street seethes with life .
ladies of the night -lrb- and day -rrb- rub shoulders with tourists and locals ; sex clubs vie for space with a new influx of upscale restaurants , cafes and nightspots . hamburg ’ s kunstmeile -lrb- art mile -rrb- , seen as a kind of anti-reeperbahn , is a neat string of galleries and museums in the old town .
the hamburger kunsthalle displays unique 20th century minimalist works that escaped the nazis ' plundering in 1937 .
there is also the modern art galerie der gegenwart , housed in a gleaming white cubic building . something fishy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday strollers brave the ice on lake alster after partaking in the city ’ s culture both low and high , dipping into its food culture is next on the list .
a visit to the fischmarkt is a must , at least for those who can wake up - or are still up - at the crack of dawn .
at the market , which has taken place for over 300 years , visitors can buy everything from smoked eel -lrb- a local snack -rrb- to flowers , fruit and just about everything else you 'd expect to find in a market . to wash down the smoked eel , grab be sure to grab an alsterwasser , a local brew of beer and lemon soda , at the strandperle located at am schulberg . … … … tips in hamburg the harbor area : at least five private companies offer boat tours of hamburg 's elbe river and its impressive port area .
most tours commence from the landungsbrücke on bei den st. pauli strasse . the sunday fish market : hamburg 's traditional flea market opens its doors with shopping , music and entertainment every sunday morning from 5 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.
tip : for many , the fischmarkt is the last stop after a night of revelry in one of germany 's most party-loving towns .
the fischmarkt is located on the grosse elbestrasse . alster : a literal urban oasis , the alster is a large lake , divided into two parts , in the heart of hamburg 's spectacular downtown .
locals sail its waters and enjoy the beer gardens that line it .
hamburg 's traditional drink , alsterwasser -lrb- a mix of beer and lemon-lime soft drink -rrb- , flows freely here .
on the city side , the lake is lined with some of hamburg 's most important properties , including the headquarters of shipping giant hapag-lloyd and the swanky four season 's hotel . spiecherstadt : the speicherstadt is the world 's oldest brick warehouse complex and the former center of trade in this port city .

munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .
it is located at the confluence of the alster and elbe rivers , and has a direct link to the north sea some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- downstream .
it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .
though by no means pretty in the traditional sense , it ’ s certainly worth a visit , if only to appreciate its size and scale .
huge container ships bound for some exotic destination float by and a variety of aromas - flowers , coffee , spices - waft from the warehouses lining the shores . located at the base of the crescent-shaped new city -lrb- which is divided from the crescent-shaped old city by the elbe river -rrb- the harbor covers more than 12 percent of hamburg , and 78 million tons of goods pass through it every year . … but not a drop to drink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water , water everywhere ...
even away from the harbor , water is everywhere in hamburg .
foghorns can be heard downtown ; shrieking sea gulls and an ever-present sea breeze enhance the maritime feeling .
the rivers elbe , alster and bille all traverse the city , creating 64 kilometers of canals requiring 2,500 bridges , giving the city its nickname " venice of the north . " the perimeter of the inner alster can be walked in about a half hour , and visitors can either rent a boat to explore the enormous outer alster , or simply sit at one of the casual dockside cafes that line its shores . in the heart of the new city is the grand church of saint michael , referred to by locals as just " michael . "
the distinctive 134-meter -lrb- 440-foot -rrb- baroque spire is hard to miss and the external beauty gives an idea of the gleaming elegance on the inside . saint michael 's tower and the many other spires and domes that dot the skyline in the old and new city , among them the st. petrikirche and the jakobkirche , are relatively young by european standards .
the great fire of 1842 destroyed a third of hamburg , but it quickly rose from the ashes , rebuilt itself and reclaimed its title as one of europe 's top ports . deichstrasse , with its impressively restored row of 17th and 18th century buildings , is one of the few surviving streets in the old city where you can see hamburg as it was in pre-industrial times .
a stroll along the impressive facades , which reach right to the water ’ s edge , is a reminder of just how tightly shipping and trade were once tied to the life of the city . the wild mile and its opposite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in hamburg is legendary a reporter once asked john lennon what it was like growing up in liverpool , and he replied , " i did n't grow up in liverpool , i grew up in hamburg . "
and of course , the city ’ s greatest international recognition comes as a result of its being the place where the beatles ’ career took off . the " fab four " played in clubs on the notorious reeperbahn , a lively , half-kilometer long strip of bars and sex shops in the st. pauli district that has since become hamburg ’ s top attraction .
one of europe ’ s largest red-light districts , the reeperbahn innocently got its name from the rope makers -lrb- rope is " reep " in the local low-german dialect -rrb- who used to live in the area and pull their long cords of rope down the street . today the street seethes with life .
ladies of the night -lrb- and day -rrb- rub shoulders with tourists and locals ; sex clubs vie for space with a new influx of upscale restaurants , cafes and nightspots . hamburg ’ s kunstmeile -lrb- art mile -rrb- , seen as a kind of anti-reeperbahn , is a neat string of galleries and museums in the old town .
the hamburger kunsthalle displays unique 20th century minimalist works that escaped the nazis ' plundering in 1937 .
there is also the modern art galerie der gegenwart , housed in a gleaming white cubic building . something fishy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday strollers brave the ice on lake alster after partaking in the city ’ s culture both low and high , dipping into its food culture is next on the list .
a visit to the fischmarkt is a must , at least for those who can wake up - or are still up - at the crack of dawn .
at the market , which has taken place for over 300 years , visitors can buy everything from smoked eel -lrb- a local snack -rrb- to flowers , fruit and just about everything else you 'd expect to find in a market . to wash down the smoked eel , grab be sure to grab an alsterwasser , a local brew of beer and lemon soda , at the strandperle located at am schulberg . … … … tips in hamburg the harbor area : at least five private companies offer boat tours of hamburg 's elbe river and its impressive port area .
most tours commence from the landungsbrücke on bei den st. pauli strasse . the sunday fish market : hamburg 's traditional flea market opens its doors with shopping , music and entertainment every sunday morning from 5 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.
tip : for many , the fischmarkt is the last stop after a night of revelry in one of germany 's most party-loving towns .
the fischmarkt is located on the grosse elbestrasse . alster : a literal urban oasis , the alster is a large lake , divided into two parts , in the heart of hamburg 's spectacular downtown .
locals sail its waters and enjoy the beer gardens that line it .
hamburg 's traditional drink , alsterwasser -lrb- a mix of beer and lemon-lime soft drink -rrb- , flows freely here .
on the city side , the lake is lined with some of hamburg 's most important properties , including the headquarters of shipping giant hapag-lloyd and the swanky four season 's hotel . spiecherstadt : the speicherstadt is the world 's oldest brick warehouse complex and the former center of trade in this port city .
today , it is filled with museums , art galleries and dozens of persian rug shops .
there 's also a spice museum that pays homage to the speicherstadt 's former importance as a way station for herbs and spices sold in europe .
it is found in the st. pauli district at landungsbrücke 3a . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no special glasses required : visit hamburg in 3-d soon you 'll be able to visit hamburg 's quaint streets and get within a foot of its grandiose baroque buildings without leaving your home .

but more than 500,000 danced at the 15th love parade saturday and cleanup crews had enough work . the cold , sober morning after germany 's annual techno love-fest is when berlin takes stock of the effect hundreds of thousands of giddy ravers can have on the city 's historic tiergarten park . orange-clad street sweepers - also the official color of the love parade - picked up more than 100 tons of trash this year , 50 tons less than last year .
that figure came although the numbers at this parade were estimated by some as larger than in recent years . around 500,000 people attended the 15th annual love parade , which started as a more-or-less spontaneous homage to the techno scene a few months before the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the parade along the stretch of road that runs through the tiergarten , began attracting more and more people from across europe and as far away as japan in the 1990s .

hundreds of thousands fans of techno music are expected to join the event .
-lrb- ap photo / franka bruns -rrb- at its height in the late 1990s , the parade attracted more than 1.5 million people .
the declining numbers of recent years combined with calls by techno scene veterans that it had passed its prime , made for an uncertain future for this year 's parade . with the help of a financial injection from corporate spoonsors and berlin 's convention center , the dozens of dj and dancer-laden trucks were able to make their way through the tiergarten once again . " of course we do n't have the gigantic -lrb- attendance -rrb- of the late 1990s , " said parade spokesman ralf regitz .
" but three-quarters of a million people is a healthy number and a good basis from which to plan the future . " the party goes on " forward even , backward never , " shouted dr. motte , one of the few remaining love parade founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl dances in front of the evening sun during the love parade in berlin , saturday , july 10 , 1999 .
men in skirts and women in furry day-glo bikinis bounced , saturday , to the techno throb of the love parade , the annual all-weekend rave billed as the world 's largest street party .
the colorfully-clad , and dyed-haired throngs heeded his call , partying from 2 p.m. into the night . then , some of the intoxicated partyers climbed into cars and left , running straight into police check points . " it 's shocking in what sort of condition some of the drivers are in , " a police spokesman told the german wire service dpa . hundreds of officers arrested dozens of people driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol in states surrounding berlin , according to police . though attendance at the parade this year matched the minimum of what organizers said they would need in order to hold it again next year , the parade 's future remains in doubt . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live kino we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .

it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .

the great fire of 1842 destroyed a third of hamburg , but it quickly rose from the ashes , rebuilt itself and reclaimed its title as one of europe 's top ports . deichstrasse , with its impressively restored row of 17th and 18th century buildings , is one of the few surviving streets in the old city where you can see hamburg as it was in pre-industrial times .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.07.2003 the love parade is dead , long live the love parade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still full of love , after 15 years .
berlin 's annual homage to the techno music scene is not what it used to be .
but more than 500,000 danced at the 15th love parade saturday and cleanup crews had enough work . the cold , sober morning after germany 's annual techno love-fest is when berlin takes stock of the effect hundreds of thousands of giddy ravers can have on the city 's historic tiergarten park . orange-clad street sweepers - also the official color of the love parade - picked up more than 100 tons of trash this year , 50 tons less than last year .
that figure came although the numbers at this parade were estimated by some as larger than in recent years . around 500,000 people attended the 15th annual love parade , which started as a more-or-less spontaneous homage to the techno scene a few months before the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the parade along the stretch of road that runs through the tiergarten , began attracting more and more people from across europe and as far away as japan in the 1990s .

-lrb- ap photo / franka bruns -rrb- - raver yvonne dances on one of the trucks of the 15th love parade in berlin , saturday , july 12 , 2003 .
hundreds of thousands fans of techno music are expected to join the event .
-lrb- ap photo / franka bruns -rrb- at its height in the late 1990s , the parade attracted more than 1.5 million people .
the declining numbers of recent years combined with calls by techno scene veterans that it had passed its prime , made for an uncertain future for this year 's parade . with the help of a financial injection from corporate spoonsors and berlin 's convention center , the dozens of dj and dancer-laden trucks were able to make their way through the tiergarten once again . " of course we do n't have the gigantic -lrb- attendance -rrb- of the late 1990s , " said parade spokesman ralf regitz .
" but three-quarters of a million people is a healthy number and a good basis from which to plan the future . " the party goes on " forward even , backward never , " shouted dr. motte , one of the few remaining love parade founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl dances in front of the evening sun during the love parade in berlin , saturday , july 10 , 1999 .

munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .
it is located at the confluence of the alster and elbe rivers , and has a direct link to the north sea some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- downstream .
it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .
though by no means pretty in the traditional sense , it ’ s certainly worth a visit , if only to appreciate its size and scale .
huge container ships bound for some exotic destination float by and a variety of aromas - flowers , coffee , spices - waft from the warehouses lining the shores . located at the base of the crescent-shaped new city -lrb- which is divided from the crescent-shaped old city by the elbe river -rrb- the harbor covers more than 12 percent of hamburg , and 78 million tons of goods pass through it every year . … but not a drop to drink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water , water everywhere ...
even away from the harbor , water is everywhere in hamburg .
foghorns can be heard downtown ; shrieking sea gulls and an ever-present sea breeze enhance the maritime feeling .
the rivers elbe , alster and bille all traverse the city , creating 64 kilometers of canals requiring 2,500 bridges , giving the city its nickname " venice of the north . " the perimeter of the inner alster can be walked in about a half hour , and visitors can either rent a boat to explore the enormous outer alster , or simply sit at one of the casual dockside cafes that line its shores . in the heart of the new city is the grand church of saint michael , referred to by locals as just " michael . "
the distinctive 134-meter -lrb- 440-foot -rrb- baroque spire is hard to miss and the external beauty gives an idea of the gleaming elegance on the inside . saint michael 's tower and the many other spires and domes that dot the skyline in the old and new city , among them the st. petrikirche and the jakobkirche , are relatively young by european standards .
the great fire of 1842 destroyed a third of hamburg , but it quickly rose from the ashes , rebuilt itself and reclaimed its title as one of europe 's top ports . deichstrasse , with its impressively restored row of 17th and 18th century buildings , is one of the few surviving streets in the old city where you can see hamburg as it was in pre-industrial times .
a stroll along the impressive facades , which reach right to the water ’ s edge , is a reminder of just how tightly shipping and trade were once tied to the life of the city . the wild mile and its opposite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in hamburg is legendary a reporter once asked john lennon what it was like growing up in liverpool , and he replied , " i did n't grow up in liverpool , i grew up in hamburg .

munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .
it is located at the confluence of the alster and elbe rivers , and has a direct link to the north sea some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- downstream .
it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .
though by no means pretty in the traditional sense , it ’ s certainly worth a visit , if only to appreciate its size and scale .
huge container ships bound for some exotic destination float by and a variety of aromas - flowers , coffee , spices - waft from the warehouses lining the shores . located at the base of the crescent-shaped new city -lrb- which is divided from the crescent-shaped old city by the elbe river -rrb- the harbor covers more than 12 percent of hamburg , and 78 million tons of goods pass through it every year . … but not a drop to drink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water , water everywhere ...
even away from the harbor , water is everywhere in hamburg .
foghorns can be heard downtown ; shrieking sea gulls and an ever-present sea breeze enhance the maritime feeling .
the rivers elbe , alster and bille all traverse the city , creating 64 kilometers of canals requiring 2,500 bridges , giving the city its nickname " venice of the north . " the perimeter of the inner alster can be walked in about a half hour , and visitors can either rent a boat to explore the enormous outer alster , or simply sit at one of the casual dockside cafes that line its shores . in the heart of the new city is the grand church of saint michael , referred to by locals as just " michael . "
the distinctive 134-meter -lrb- 440-foot -rrb- baroque spire is hard to miss and the external beauty gives an idea of the gleaming elegance on the inside . saint michael 's tower and the many other spires and domes that dot the skyline in the old and new city , among them the st. petrikirche and the jakobkirche , are relatively young by european standards .
the great fire of 1842 destroyed a third of hamburg , but it quickly rose from the ashes , rebuilt itself and reclaimed its title as one of europe 's top ports . deichstrasse , with its impressively restored row of 17th and 18th century buildings , is one of the few surviving streets in the old city where you can see hamburg as it was in pre-industrial times .
a stroll along the impressive facades , which reach right to the water ’ s edge , is a reminder of just how tightly shipping and trade were once tied to the life of the city . the wild mile and its opposite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in hamburg is legendary a reporter once asked john lennon what it was like growing up in liverpool , and he replied , " i did n't grow up in liverpool , i grew up in hamburg .

munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .
it is located at the confluence of the alster and elbe rivers , and has a direct link to the north sea some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- downstream .
it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .
though by no means pretty in the traditional sense , it ’ s certainly worth a visit , if only to appreciate its size and scale .
huge container ships bound for some exotic destination float by and a variety of aromas - flowers , coffee , spices - waft from the warehouses lining the shores . located at the base of the crescent-shaped new city -lrb- which is divided from the crescent-shaped old city by the elbe river -rrb- the harbor covers more than 12 percent of hamburg , and 78 million tons of goods pass through it every year . … but not a drop to drink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water , water everywhere ...
even away from the harbor , water is everywhere in hamburg .
foghorns can be heard downtown ; shrieking sea gulls and an ever-present sea breeze enhance the maritime feeling .
the rivers elbe , alster and bille all traverse the city , creating 64 kilometers of canals requiring 2,500 bridges , giving the city its nickname " venice of the north . " the perimeter of the inner alster can be walked in about a half hour , and visitors can either rent a boat to explore the enormous outer alster , or simply sit at one of the casual dockside cafes that line its shores . in the heart of the new city is the grand church of saint michael , referred to by locals as just " michael .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.07.2003 the love parade is dead , long live the love parade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still full of love , after 15 years .
berlin 's annual homage to the techno music scene is not what it used to be .
but more than 500,000 danced at the 15th love parade saturday and cleanup crews had enough work . the cold , sober morning after germany 's annual techno love-fest is when berlin takes stock of the effect hundreds of thousands of giddy ravers can have on the city 's historic tiergarten park . orange-clad street sweepers - also the official color of the love parade - picked up more than 100 tons of trash this year , 50 tons less than last year .
that figure came although the numbers at this parade were estimated by some as larger than in recent years . around 500,000 people attended the 15th annual love parade , which started as a more-or-less spontaneous homage to the techno scene a few months before the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the parade along the stretch of road that runs through the tiergarten , began attracting more and more people from across europe and as far away as japan in the 1990s .

munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .
it is located at the confluence of the alster and elbe rivers , and has a direct link to the north sea some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- downstream .
it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .
though by no means pretty in the traditional sense , it ’ s certainly worth a visit , if only to appreciate its size and scale .
huge container ships bound for some exotic destination float by and a variety of aromas - flowers , coffee , spices - waft from the warehouses lining the shores . located at the base of the crescent-shaped new city -lrb- which is divided from the crescent-shaped old city by the elbe river -rrb- the harbor covers more than 12 percent of hamburg , and 78 million tons of goods pass through it every year . … but not a drop to drink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water , water everywhere ...
even away from the harbor , water is everywhere in hamburg .
foghorns can be heard downtown ; shrieking sea gulls and an ever-present sea breeze enhance the maritime feeling .
the rivers elbe , alster and bille all traverse the city , creating 64 kilometers of canals requiring 2,500 bridges , giving the city its nickname " venice of the north . " the perimeter of the inner alster can be walked in about a half hour , and visitors can either rent a boat to explore the enormous outer alster , or simply sit at one of the casual dockside cafes that line its shores . in the heart of the new city is the grand church of saint michael , referred to by locals as just " michael . "
the distinctive 134-meter -lrb- 440-foot -rrb- baroque spire is hard to miss and the external beauty gives an idea of the gleaming elegance on the inside . saint michael 's tower and the many other spires and domes that dot the skyline in the old and new city , among them the st. petrikirche and the jakobkirche , are relatively young by european standards .
the great fire of 1842 destroyed a third of hamburg , but it quickly rose from the ashes , rebuilt itself and reclaimed its title as one of europe 's top ports . deichstrasse , with its impressively restored row of 17th and 18th century buildings , is one of the few surviving streets in the old city where you can see hamburg as it was in pre-industrial times .
a stroll along the impressive facades , which reach right to the water ’ s edge , is a reminder of just how tightly shipping and trade were once tied to the life of the city . the wild mile and its opposite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in hamburg is legendary a reporter once asked john lennon what it was like growing up in liverpool , and he replied , " i did n't grow up in liverpool , i grew up in hamburg . "
and of course , the city ’ s greatest international recognition comes as a result of its being the place where the beatles ’ career took off . the " fab four " played in clubs on the notorious reeperbahn , a lively , half-kilometer long strip of bars and sex shops in the st. pauli district that has since become hamburg ’ s top attraction .
one of europe ’ s largest red-light districts , the reeperbahn innocently got its name from the rope makers -lrb- rope is " reep " in the local low-german dialect -rrb- who used to live in the area and pull their long cords of rope down the street . today the street seethes with life .
ladies of the night -lrb- and day -rrb- rub shoulders with tourists and locals ; sex clubs vie for space with a new influx of upscale restaurants , cafes and nightspots . hamburg ’ s kunstmeile -lrb- art mile -rrb- , seen as a kind of anti-reeperbahn , is a neat string of galleries and museums in the old town .
the hamburger kunsthalle displays unique 20th century minimalist works that escaped the nazis ' plundering in 1937 .
there is also the modern art galerie der gegenwart , housed in a gleaming white cubic building . something fishy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday strollers brave the ice on lake alster after partaking in the city ’ s culture both low and high , dipping into its food culture is next on the list .
a visit to the fischmarkt is a must , at least for those who can wake up - or are still up - at the crack of dawn .
at the market , which has taken place for over 300 years , visitors can buy everything from smoked eel -lrb- a local snack -rrb- to flowers , fruit and just about everything else you 'd expect to find in a market . to wash down the smoked eel , grab be sure to grab an alsterwasser , a local brew of beer and lemon soda , at the strandperle located at am schulberg . … … … tips in hamburg the harbor area : at least five private companies offer boat tours of hamburg 's elbe river and its impressive port area .
most tours commence from the landungsbrücke on bei den st. pauli strasse . the sunday fish market : hamburg 's traditional flea market opens its doors with shopping , music and entertainment every sunday morning from 5 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.
tip : for many , the fischmarkt is the last stop after a night of revelry in one of germany 's most party-loving towns .
the fischmarkt is located on the grosse elbestrasse . alster : a literal urban oasis , the alster is a large lake , divided into two parts , in the heart of hamburg 's spectacular downtown .
locals sail its waters and enjoy the beer gardens that line it .
hamburg 's traditional drink , alsterwasser -lrb- a mix of beer and lemon-lime soft drink -rrb- , flows freely here .
on the city side , the lake is lined with some of hamburg 's most important properties , including the headquarters of shipping giant hapag-lloyd and the swanky four season 's hotel . spiecherstadt : the speicherstadt is the world 's oldest brick warehouse complex and the former center of trade in this port city .
today , it is filled with museums , art galleries and dozens of persian rug shops .
there 's also a spice museum that pays homage to the speicherstadt 's former importance as a way station for herbs and spices sold in europe .
it is found in the st. pauli district at landungsbrücke 3a . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no special glasses required : visit hamburg in 3-d soon you 'll be able to visit hamburg 's quaint streets and get within a foot of its grandiose baroque buildings without leaving your home .

munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .
it is located at the confluence of the alster and elbe rivers , and has a direct link to the north sea some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- downstream .
it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .
though by no means pretty in the traditional sense , it ’ s certainly worth a visit , if only to appreciate its size and scale .
huge container ships bound for some exotic destination float by and a variety of aromas - flowers , coffee , spices - waft from the warehouses lining the shores . located at the base of the crescent-shaped new city -lrb- which is divided from the crescent-shaped old city by the elbe river -rrb- the harbor covers more than 12 percent of hamburg , and 78 million tons of goods pass through it every year . … but not a drop to drink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water , water everywhere ...
even away from the harbor , water is everywhere in hamburg .
foghorns can be heard downtown ; shrieking sea gulls and an ever-present sea breeze enhance the maritime feeling .
the rivers elbe , alster and bille all traverse the city , creating 64 kilometers of canals requiring 2,500 bridges , giving the city its nickname " venice of the north . " the perimeter of the inner alster can be walked in about a half hour , and visitors can either rent a boat to explore the enormous outer alster , or simply sit at one of the casual dockside cafes that line its shores . in the heart of the new city is the grand church of saint michael , referred to by locals as just " michael . "
the distinctive 134-meter -lrb- 440-foot -rrb- baroque spire is hard to miss and the external beauty gives an idea of the gleaming elegance on the inside . saint michael 's tower and the many other spires and domes that dot the skyline in the old and new city , among them the st. petrikirche and the jakobkirche , are relatively young by european standards .
the great fire of 1842 destroyed a third of hamburg , but it quickly rose from the ashes , rebuilt itself and reclaimed its title as one of europe 's top ports . deichstrasse , with its impressively restored row of 17th and 18th century buildings , is one of the few surviving streets in the old city where you can see hamburg as it was in pre-industrial times .
a stroll along the impressive facades , which reach right to the water ’ s edge , is a reminder of just how tightly shipping and trade were once tied to the life of the city . the wild mile and its opposite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in hamburg is legendary a reporter once asked john lennon what it was like growing up in liverpool , and he replied , " i did n't grow up in liverpool , i grew up in hamburg . "
and of course , the city ’ s greatest international recognition comes as a result of its being the place where the beatles ’ career took off . the " fab four " played in clubs on the notorious reeperbahn , a lively , half-kilometer long strip of bars and sex shops in the st. pauli district that has since become hamburg ’ s top attraction .
one of europe ’ s largest red-light districts , the reeperbahn innocently got its name from the rope makers -lrb- rope is " reep " in the local low-german dialect -rrb- who used to live in the area and pull their long cords of rope down the street . today the street seethes with life .
ladies of the night -lrb- and day -rrb- rub shoulders with tourists and locals ; sex clubs vie for space with a new influx of upscale restaurants , cafes and nightspots . hamburg ’ s kunstmeile -lrb- art mile -rrb- , seen as a kind of anti-reeperbahn , is a neat string of galleries and museums in the old town .
the hamburger kunsthalle displays unique 20th century minimalist works that escaped the nazis ' plundering in 1937 .
there is also the modern art galerie der gegenwart , housed in a gleaming white cubic building . something fishy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday strollers brave the ice on lake alster after partaking in the city ’ s culture both low and high , dipping into its food culture is next on the list .
a visit to the fischmarkt is a must , at least for those who can wake up - or are still up - at the crack of dawn .
at the market , which has taken place for over 300 years , visitors can buy everything from smoked eel -lrb- a local snack -rrb- to flowers , fruit and just about everything else you 'd expect to find in a market . to wash down the smoked eel , grab be sure to grab an alsterwasser , a local brew of beer and lemon soda , at the strandperle located at am schulberg . … … … tips in hamburg the harbor area : at least five private companies offer boat tours of hamburg 's elbe river and its impressive port area .
most tours commence from the landungsbrücke on bei den st. pauli strasse . the sunday fish market : hamburg 's traditional flea market opens its doors with shopping , music and entertainment every sunday morning from 5 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.
tip : for many , the fischmarkt is the last stop after a night of revelry in one of germany 's most party-loving towns .
the fischmarkt is located on the grosse elbestrasse . alster : a literal urban oasis , the alster is a large lake , divided into two parts , in the heart of hamburg 's spectacular downtown .
locals sail its waters and enjoy the beer gardens that line it .
hamburg 's traditional drink , alsterwasser -lrb- a mix of beer and lemon-lime soft drink -rrb- , flows freely here .
on the city side , the lake is lined with some of hamburg 's most important properties , including the headquarters of shipping giant hapag-lloyd and the swanky four season 's hotel . spiecherstadt : the speicherstadt is the world 's oldest brick warehouse complex and the former center of trade in this port city .
today , it is filled with museums , art galleries and dozens of persian rug shops .
there 's also a spice museum that pays homage to the speicherstadt 's former importance as a way station for herbs and spices sold in europe .
it is found in the st. pauli district at landungsbrücke 3a . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no special glasses required : visit hamburg in 3-d soon you 'll be able to visit hamburg 's quaint streets and get within a foot of its grandiose baroque buildings without leaving your home .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.07.2003 the love parade is dead , long live the love parade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still full of love , after 15 years .
berlin 's annual homage to the techno music scene is not what it used to be .
but more than 500,000 danced at the 15th love parade saturday and cleanup crews had enough work . the cold , sober morning after germany 's annual techno love-fest is when berlin takes stock of the effect hundreds of thousands of giddy ravers can have on the city 's historic tiergarten park . orange-clad street sweepers - also the official color of the love parade - picked up more than 100 tons of trash this year , 50 tons less than last year .
that figure came although the numbers at this parade were estimated by some as larger than in recent years . around 500,000 people attended the 15th annual love parade , which started as a more-or-less spontaneous homage to the techno scene a few months before the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the parade along the stretch of road that runs through the tiergarten , began attracting more and more people from across europe and as far away as japan in the 1990s .

munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .
it is located at the confluence of the alster and elbe rivers , and has a direct link to the north sea some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- downstream .
it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .
though by no means pretty in the traditional sense , it ’ s certainly worth a visit , if only to appreciate its size and scale .
huge container ships bound for some exotic destination float by and a variety of aromas - flowers , coffee , spices - waft from the warehouses lining the shores . located at the base of the crescent-shaped new city -lrb- which is divided from the crescent-shaped old city by the elbe river -rrb- the harbor covers more than 12 percent of hamburg , and 78 million tons of goods pass through it every year . … but not a drop to drink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water , water everywhere ...
even away from the harbor , water is everywhere in hamburg .
foghorns can be heard downtown ; shrieking sea gulls and an ever-present sea breeze enhance the maritime feeling .
the rivers elbe , alster and bille all traverse the city , creating 64 kilometers of canals requiring 2,500 bridges , giving the city its nickname " venice of the north . " the perimeter of the inner alster can be walked in about a half hour , and visitors can either rent a boat to explore the enormous outer alster , or simply sit at one of the casual dockside cafes that line its shores . in the heart of the new city is the grand church of saint michael , referred to by locals as just " michael . "
the distinctive 134-meter -lrb- 440-foot -rrb- baroque spire is hard to miss and the external beauty gives an idea of the gleaming elegance on the inside . saint michael 's tower and the many other spires and domes that dot the skyline in the old and new city , among them the st. petrikirche and the jakobkirche , are relatively young by european standards .
the great fire of 1842 destroyed a third of hamburg , but it quickly rose from the ashes , rebuilt itself and reclaimed its title as one of europe 's top ports . deichstrasse , with its impressively restored row of 17th and 18th century buildings , is one of the few surviving streets in the old city where you can see hamburg as it was in pre-industrial times .
a stroll along the impressive facades , which reach right to the water ’ s edge , is a reminder of just how tightly shipping and trade were once tied to the life of the city . the wild mile and its opposite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in hamburg is legendary a reporter once asked john lennon what it was like growing up in liverpool , and he replied , " i did n't grow up in liverpool , i grew up in hamburg . "
and of course , the city ’ s greatest international recognition comes as a result of its being the place where the beatles ’ career took off . the " fab four " played in clubs on the notorious reeperbahn , a lively , half-kilometer long strip of bars and sex shops in the st. pauli district that has since become hamburg ’ s top attraction .
one of europe ’ s largest red-light districts , the reeperbahn innocently got its name from the rope makers -lrb- rope is " reep " in the local low-german dialect -rrb- who used to live in the area and pull their long cords of rope down the street . today the street seethes with life .
ladies of the night -lrb- and day -rrb- rub shoulders with tourists and locals ; sex clubs vie for space with a new influx of upscale restaurants , cafes and nightspots . hamburg ’ s kunstmeile -lrb- art mile -rrb- , seen as a kind of anti-reeperbahn , is a neat string of galleries and museums in the old town .
the hamburger kunsthalle displays unique 20th century minimalist works that escaped the nazis ' plundering in 1937 .
there is also the modern art galerie der gegenwart , housed in a gleaming white cubic building . something fishy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday strollers brave the ice on lake alster after partaking in the city ’ s culture both low and high , dipping into its food culture is next on the list .
a visit to the fischmarkt is a must , at least for those who can wake up - or are still up - at the crack of dawn .
at the market , which has taken place for over 300 years , visitors can buy everything from smoked eel -lrb- a local snack -rrb- to flowers , fruit and just about everything else you 'd expect to find in a market . to wash down the smoked eel , grab be sure to grab an alsterwasser , a local brew of beer and lemon soda , at the strandperle located at am schulberg . … … … tips in hamburg the harbor area : at least five private companies offer boat tours of hamburg 's elbe river and its impressive port area .

munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .
it is located at the confluence of the alster and elbe rivers , and has a direct link to the north sea some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- downstream .
it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .
though by no means pretty in the traditional sense , it ’ s certainly worth a visit , if only to appreciate its size and scale .
huge container ships bound for some exotic destination float by and a variety of aromas - flowers , coffee , spices - waft from the warehouses lining the shores . located at the base of the crescent-shaped new city -lrb- which is divided from the crescent-shaped old city by the elbe river -rrb- the harbor covers more than 12 percent of hamburg , and 78 million tons of goods pass through it every year . … but not a drop to drink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water , water everywhere ...
even away from the harbor , water is everywhere in hamburg .
foghorns can be heard downtown ; shrieking sea gulls and an ever-present sea breeze enhance the maritime feeling .
the rivers elbe , alster and bille all traverse the city , creating 64 kilometers of canals requiring 2,500 bridges , giving the city its nickname " venice of the north . " the perimeter of the inner alster can be walked in about a half hour , and visitors can either rent a boat to explore the enormous outer alster , or simply sit at one of the casual dockside cafes that line its shores . in the heart of the new city is the grand church of saint michael , referred to by locals as just " michael . "
the distinctive 134-meter -lrb- 440-foot -rrb- baroque spire is hard to miss and the external beauty gives an idea of the gleaming elegance on the inside . saint michael 's tower and the many other spires and domes that dot the skyline in the old and new city , among them the st. petrikirche and the jakobkirche , are relatively young by european standards .
the great fire of 1842 destroyed a third of hamburg , but it quickly rose from the ashes , rebuilt itself and reclaimed its title as one of europe 's top ports . deichstrasse , with its impressively restored row of 17th and 18th century buildings , is one of the few surviving streets in the old city where you can see hamburg as it was in pre-industrial times .
a stroll along the impressive facades , which reach right to the water ’ s edge , is a reminder of just how tightly shipping and trade were once tied to the life of the city . the wild mile and its opposite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in hamburg is legendary a reporter once asked john lennon what it was like growing up in liverpool , and he replied , " i did n't grow up in liverpool , i grew up in hamburg . "
and of course , the city ’ s greatest international recognition comes as a result of its being the place where the beatles ’ career took off . the " fab four " played in clubs on the notorious reeperbahn , a lively , half-kilometer long strip of bars and sex shops in the st. pauli district that has since become hamburg ’ s top attraction .
one of europe ’ s largest red-light districts , the reeperbahn innocently got its name from the rope makers -lrb- rope is " reep " in the local low-german dialect -rrb- who used to live in the area and pull their long cords of rope down the street . today the street seethes with life .
ladies of the night -lrb- and day -rrb- rub shoulders with tourists and locals ; sex clubs vie for space with a new influx of upscale restaurants , cafes and nightspots . hamburg ’ s kunstmeile -lrb- art mile -rrb- , seen as a kind of anti-reeperbahn , is a neat string of galleries and museums in the old town .
the hamburger kunsthalle displays unique 20th century minimalist works that escaped the nazis ' plundering in 1937 .
there is also the modern art galerie der gegenwart , housed in a gleaming white cubic building . something fishy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday strollers brave the ice on lake alster after partaking in the city ’ s culture both low and high , dipping into its food culture is next on the list .
a visit to the fischmarkt is a must , at least for those who can wake up - or are still up - at the crack of dawn .

munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .
it is located at the confluence of the alster and elbe rivers , and has a direct link to the north sea some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- downstream .
it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .
though by no means pretty in the traditional sense , it ’ s certainly worth a visit , if only to appreciate its size and scale .
huge container ships bound for some exotic destination float by and a variety of aromas - flowers , coffee , spices - waft from the warehouses lining the shores . located at the base of the crescent-shaped new city -lrb- which is divided from the crescent-shaped old city by the elbe river -rrb- the harbor covers more than 12 percent of hamburg , and 78 million tons of goods pass through it every year . … but not a drop to drink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water , water everywhere ...
even away from the harbor , water is everywhere in hamburg .
foghorns can be heard downtown ; shrieking sea gulls and an ever-present sea breeze enhance the maritime feeling .
the rivers elbe , alster and bille all traverse the city , creating 64 kilometers of canals requiring 2,500 bridges , giving the city its nickname " venice of the north . " the perimeter of the inner alster can be walked in about a half hour , and visitors can either rent a boat to explore the enormous outer alster , or simply sit at one of the casual dockside cafes that line its shores . in the heart of the new city is the grand church of saint michael , referred to by locals as just " michael . "
the distinctive 134-meter -lrb- 440-foot -rrb- baroque spire is hard to miss and the external beauty gives an idea of the gleaming elegance on the inside . saint michael 's tower and the many other spires and domes that dot the skyline in the old and new city , among them the st. petrikirche and the jakobkirche , are relatively young by european standards .
the great fire of 1842 destroyed a third of hamburg , but it quickly rose from the ashes , rebuilt itself and reclaimed its title as one of europe 's top ports . deichstrasse , with its impressively restored row of 17th and 18th century buildings , is one of the few surviving streets in the old city where you can see hamburg as it was in pre-industrial times .
a stroll along the impressive facades , which reach right to the water ’ s edge , is a reminder of just how tightly shipping and trade were once tied to the life of the city . the wild mile and its opposite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in hamburg is legendary a reporter once asked john lennon what it was like growing up in liverpool , and he replied , " i did n't grow up in liverpool , i grew up in hamburg .

and of course , the city ’ s greatest international recognition comes as a result of its being the place where the beatles ’ career took off . the " fab four " played in clubs on the notorious reeperbahn , a lively , half-kilometer long strip of bars and sex shops in the st. pauli district that has since become hamburg ’ s top attraction .
one of europe ’ s largest red-light districts , the reeperbahn innocently got its name from the rope makers -lrb- rope is " reep " in the local low-german dialect -rrb- who used to live in the area and pull their long cords of rope down the street . today the street seethes with life .
ladies of the night -lrb- and day -rrb- rub shoulders with tourists and locals ; sex clubs vie for space with a new influx of upscale restaurants , cafes and nightspots . hamburg ’ s kunstmeile -lrb- art mile -rrb- , seen as a kind of anti-reeperbahn , is a neat string of galleries and museums in the old town .

berlin 's annual homage to the techno music scene is not what it used to be .

that figure came although the numbers at this parade were estimated by some as larger than in recent years . around 500,000 people attended the 15th annual love parade , which started as a more-or-less spontaneous homage to the techno scene a few months before the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the parade along the stretch of road that runs through the tiergarten , began attracting more and more people from across europe and as far away as japan in the 1990s .

-lrb- ap photo / franka bruns -rrb- - raver yvonne dances on one of the trucks of the 15th love parade in berlin , saturday , july 12 , 2003 .
hundreds of thousands fans of techno music are expected to join the event .
-lrb- ap photo / franka bruns -rrb- at its height in the late 1990s , the parade attracted more than 1.5 million people .
the declining numbers of recent years combined with calls by techno scene veterans that it had passed its prime , made for an uncertain future for this year 's parade . with the help of a financial injection from corporate spoonsors and berlin 's convention center , the dozens of dj and dancer-laden trucks were able to make their way through the tiergarten once again . " of course we do n't have the gigantic -lrb- attendance -rrb- of the late 1990s , " said parade spokesman ralf regitz .
" but three-quarters of a million people is a healthy number and a good basis from which to plan the future . " the party goes on " forward even , backward never , " shouted dr. motte , one of the few remaining love parade founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl dances in front of the evening sun during the love parade in berlin , saturday , july 10 , 1999 .
men in skirts and women in furry day-glo bikinis bounced , saturday , to the techno throb of the love parade , the annual all-weekend rave billed as the world 's largest street party .
the colorfully-clad , and dyed-haired throngs heeded his call , partying from 2 p.m. into the night . then , some of the intoxicated partyers climbed into cars and left , running straight into police check points . " it 's shocking in what sort of condition some of the drivers are in , " a police spokesman told the german wire service dpa . hundreds of officers arrested dozens of people driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol in states surrounding berlin , according to police . though attendance at the parade this year matched the minimum of what organizers said they would need in order to hold it again next year , the parade 's future remains in doubt . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .
it is located at the confluence of the alster and elbe rivers , and has a direct link to the north sea some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- downstream .
it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .
though by no means pretty in the traditional sense , it ’ s certainly worth a visit , if only to appreciate its size and scale .
huge container ships bound for some exotic destination float by and a variety of aromas - flowers , coffee , spices - waft from the warehouses lining the shores . located at the base of the crescent-shaped new city -lrb- which is divided from the crescent-shaped old city by the elbe river -rrb- the harbor covers more than 12 percent of hamburg , and 78 million tons of goods pass through it every year . … but not a drop to drink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water , water everywhere ...
even away from the harbor , water is everywhere in hamburg .
foghorns can be heard downtown ; shrieking sea gulls and an ever-present sea breeze enhance the maritime feeling .
the rivers elbe , alster and bille all traverse the city , creating 64 kilometers of canals requiring 2,500 bridges , giving the city its nickname " venice of the north . " the perimeter of the inner alster can be walked in about a half hour , and visitors can either rent a boat to explore the enormous outer alster , or simply sit at one of the casual dockside cafes that line its shores . in the heart of the new city is the grand church of saint michael , referred to by locals as just " michael . "
the distinctive 134-meter -lrb- 440-foot -rrb- baroque spire is hard to miss and the external beauty gives an idea of the gleaming elegance on the inside . saint michael 's tower and the many other spires and domes that dot the skyline in the old and new city , among them the st. petrikirche and the jakobkirche , are relatively young by european standards .
the great fire of 1842 destroyed a third of hamburg , but it quickly rose from the ashes , rebuilt itself and reclaimed its title as one of europe 's top ports . deichstrasse , with its impressively restored row of 17th and 18th century buildings , is one of the few surviving streets in the old city where you can see hamburg as it was in pre-industrial times .
a stroll along the impressive facades , which reach right to the water ’ s edge , is a reminder of just how tightly shipping and trade were once tied to the life of the city . the wild mile and its opposite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in hamburg is legendary a reporter once asked john lennon what it was like growing up in liverpool , and he replied , " i did n't grow up in liverpool , i grew up in hamburg . "
and of course , the city ’ s greatest international recognition comes as a result of its being the place where the beatles ’ career took off . the " fab four " played in clubs on the notorious reeperbahn , a lively , half-kilometer long strip of bars and sex shops in the st. pauli district that has since become hamburg ’ s top attraction .
one of europe ’ s largest red-light districts , the reeperbahn innocently got its name from the rope makers -lrb- rope is " reep " in the local low-german dialect -rrb- who used to live in the area and pull their long cords of rope down the street . today the street seethes with life .
ladies of the night -lrb- and day -rrb- rub shoulders with tourists and locals ; sex clubs vie for space with a new influx of upscale restaurants , cafes and nightspots . hamburg ’ s kunstmeile -lrb- art mile -rrb- , seen as a kind of anti-reeperbahn , is a neat string of galleries and museums in the old town .
the hamburger kunsthalle displays unique 20th century minimalist works that escaped the nazis ' plundering in 1937 .
there is also the modern art galerie der gegenwart , housed in a gleaming white cubic building . something fishy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday strollers brave the ice on lake alster after partaking in the city ’ s culture both low and high , dipping into its food culture is next on the list .
a visit to the fischmarkt is a must , at least for those who can wake up - or are still up - at the crack of dawn .
at the market , which has taken place for over 300 years , visitors can buy everything from smoked eel -lrb- a local snack -rrb- to flowers , fruit and just about everything else you 'd expect to find in a market . to wash down the smoked eel , grab be sure to grab an alsterwasser , a local brew of beer and lemon soda , at the strandperle located at am schulberg . … … … tips in hamburg the harbor area : at least five private companies offer boat tours of hamburg 's elbe river and its impressive port area .
most tours commence from the landungsbrücke on bei den st. pauli strasse . the sunday fish market : hamburg 's traditional flea market opens its doors with shopping , music and entertainment every sunday morning from 5 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.
tip : for many , the fischmarkt is the last stop after a night of revelry in one of germany 's most party-loving towns .
the fischmarkt is located on the grosse elbestrasse . alster : a literal urban oasis , the alster is a large lake , divided into two parts , in the heart of hamburg 's spectacular downtown .
locals sail its waters and enjoy the beer gardens that line it .
hamburg 's traditional drink , alsterwasser -lrb- a mix of beer and lemon-lime soft drink -rrb- , flows freely here .
on the city side , the lake is lined with some of hamburg 's most important properties , including the headquarters of shipping giant hapag-lloyd and the swanky four season 's hotel . spiecherstadt : the speicherstadt is the world 's oldest brick warehouse complex and the former center of trade in this port city .
today , it is filled with museums , art galleries and dozens of persian rug shops .
there 's also a spice museum that pays homage to the speicherstadt 's former importance as a way station for herbs and spices sold in europe .

munich : beer heaven and a whole lot more cities -pipe- 13.07.2003 hamburg : germany 's gate to the world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : landungsbrücke in hamburg it 's germany 's largest deep water port as well as one of the country 's biggest cities .
take an inside look at hamburg , the center of german imports and exports and a true city of saints and sinners . hamburg is a city of superlatives : the biggest , the most , the oldest .
it has the biggest and busiest harbor in germany , most of germany 's major media , the oldest stock exchange in germany , more bridges than venice - and even the world 's largest fitness studio . hamburg is also the most expensive place to live in germany .
but the people who live there think it ’ s worth it , as do the thousands who visit each year . it 's one of the few german cities with that buzzing , big-city feel , and is renowned for its elegant flair .
packed to the gills , the city is , quite literally , running out of space .
easing the burden , the city center is scheduled to grow in size by nearly 40 percent when a recently begun 383-acre harbor redevelopment project is completed , sometime in the next 20 years . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 78 million tons of goods pass through every year germany 's second-largest city has been a gateway to the world for centuries .
it is located at the confluence of the alster and elbe rivers , and has a direct link to the north sea some 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- downstream .
it ’ s no wonder the harbor grew by leaps and bounds starting in the 12th century , making hamburg germany ’ s most important port . the harbor dominates the cityscape .
though by no means pretty in the traditional sense , it ’ s certainly worth a visit , if only to appreciate its size and scale .
huge container ships bound for some exotic destination float by and a variety of aromas - flowers , coffee , spices - waft from the warehouses lining the shores . located at the base of the crescent-shaped new city -lrb- which is divided from the crescent-shaped old city by the elbe river -rrb- the harbor covers more than 12 percent of hamburg , and 78 million tons of goods pass through it every year . … but not a drop to drink bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water , water everywhere ...
even away from the harbor , water is everywhere in hamburg .
foghorns can be heard downtown ; shrieking sea gulls and an ever-present sea breeze enhance the maritime feeling .
the rivers elbe , alster and bille all traverse the city , creating 64 kilometers of canals requiring 2,500 bridges , giving the city its nickname " venice of the north . " the perimeter of the inner alster can be walked in about a half hour , and visitors can either rent a boat to explore the enormous outer alster , or simply sit at one of the casual dockside cafes that line its shores . in the heart of the new city is the grand church of saint michael , referred to by locals as just " michael . "
the distinctive 134-meter -lrb- 440-foot -rrb- baroque spire is hard to miss and the external beauty gives an idea of the gleaming elegance on the inside . saint michael 's tower and the many other spires and domes that dot the skyline in the old and new city , among them the st. petrikirche and the jakobkirche , are relatively young by european standards .
the great fire of 1842 destroyed a third of hamburg , but it quickly rose from the ashes , rebuilt itself and reclaimed its title as one of europe 's top ports . deichstrasse , with its impressively restored row of 17th and 18th century buildings , is one of the few surviving streets in the old city where you can see hamburg as it was in pre-industrial times .
a stroll along the impressive facades , which reach right to the water ’ s edge , is a reminder of just how tightly shipping and trade were once tied to the life of the city . the wild mile and its opposite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in hamburg is legendary a reporter once asked john lennon what it was like growing up in liverpool , and he replied , " i did n't grow up in liverpool , i grew up in hamburg . "
and of course , the city ’ s greatest international recognition comes as a result of its being the place where the beatles ’ career took off . the " fab four " played in clubs on the notorious reeperbahn , a lively , half-kilometer long strip of bars and sex shops in the st. pauli district that has since become hamburg ’ s top attraction .
one of europe ’ s largest red-light districts , the reeperbahn innocently got its name from the rope makers -lrb- rope is " reep " in the local low-german dialect -rrb- who used to live in the area and pull their long cords of rope down the street . today the street seethes with life .
ladies of the night -lrb- and day -rrb- rub shoulders with tourists and locals ; sex clubs vie for space with a new influx of upscale restaurants , cafes and nightspots . hamburg ’ s kunstmeile -lrb- art mile -rrb- , seen as a kind of anti-reeperbahn , is a neat string of galleries and museums in the old town .
the hamburger kunsthalle displays unique 20th century minimalist works that escaped the nazis ' plundering in 1937 .
there is also the modern art galerie der gegenwart , housed in a gleaming white cubic building . something fishy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sunday strollers brave the ice on lake alster after partaking in the city ’ s culture both low and high , dipping into its food culture is next on the list .
a visit to the fischmarkt is a must , at least for those who can wake up - or are still up - at the crack of dawn .
at the market , which has taken place for over 300 years , visitors can buy everything from smoked eel -lrb- a local snack -rrb- to flowers , fruit and just about everything else you 'd expect to find in a market . to wash down the smoked eel , grab be sure to grab an alsterwasser , a local brew of beer and lemon soda , at the strandperle located at am schulberg . … … … tips in hamburg the harbor area : at least five private companies offer boat tours of hamburg 's elbe river and its impressive port area .
most tours commence from the landungsbrücke on bei den st. pauli strasse . the sunday fish market : hamburg 's traditional flea market opens its doors with shopping , music and entertainment every sunday morning from 5 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.
tip : for many , the fischmarkt is the last stop after a night of revelry in one of germany 's most party-loving towns .
the fischmarkt is located on the grosse elbestrasse . alster : a literal urban oasis , the alster is a large lake , divided into two parts , in the heart of hamburg 's spectacular downtown .
locals sail its waters and enjoy the beer gardens that line it .
hamburg 's traditional drink , alsterwasser -lrb- a mix of beer and lemon-lime soft drink -rrb- , flows freely here .
on the city side , the lake is lined with some of hamburg 's most important properties , including the headquarters of shipping giant hapag-lloyd and the swanky four season 's hotel . spiecherstadt : the speicherstadt is the world 's oldest brick warehouse complex and the former center of trade in this port city .
today , it is filled with museums , art galleries and dozens of persian rug shops .
there 's also a spice museum that pays homage to the speicherstadt 's former importance as a way station for herbs and spices sold in europe .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs having a " conscious party " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.07.2003 the love parade is dead , long live the love parade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still full of love , after 15 years .
berlin 's annual homage to the techno music scene is not what it used to be .
but more than 500,000 danced at the 15th love parade saturday and cleanup crews had enough work . the cold , sober morning after germany 's annual techno love-fest is when berlin takes stock of the effect hundreds of thousands of giddy ravers can have on the city 's historic tiergarten park . orange-clad street sweepers - also the official color of the love parade - picked up more than 100 tons of trash this year , 50 tons less than last year .
that figure came although the numbers at this parade were estimated by some as larger than in recent years . around 500,000 people attended the 15th annual love parade , which started as a more-or-less spontaneous homage to the techno scene a few months before the fall of the wall in 1989 .
the parade along the stretch of road that runs through the tiergarten , began attracting more and more people from across europe and as far away as japan in the 1990s .

hunderttausende fans der techno-musik werden erwartet .
-lrb- ap photo / franka bruns -rrb- - raver yvonne dances on one of the trucks of the 15th love parade in berlin , saturday , july 12 , 2003 .
hundreds of thousands fans of techno music are expected to join the event .
-lrb- ap photo / franka bruns -rrb- at its height in the late 1990s , the parade attracted more than 1.5 million people .
the declining numbers of recent years combined with calls by techno scene veterans that it had passed its prime , made for an uncertain future for this year 's parade . with the help of a financial injection from corporate spoonsors and berlin 's convention center , the dozens of dj and dancer-laden trucks were able to make their way through the tiergarten once again . " of course we do n't have the gigantic -lrb- attendance -rrb- of the late 1990s , " said parade spokesman ralf regitz .
" but three-quarters of a million people is a healthy number and a good basis from which to plan the future . " the party goes on " forward even , backward never , " shouted dr. motte , one of the few remaining love parade founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl dances in front of the evening sun during the love parade in berlin , saturday , july 10 , 1999 .
men in skirts and women in furry day-glo bikinis bounced , saturday , to the techno throb of the love parade , the annual all-weekend rave billed as the world 's largest street party .
the colorfully-clad , and dyed-haired throngs heeded his call , partying from 2 p.m. into the night . then , some of the intoxicated partyers climbed into cars and left , running straight into police check points . " it 's shocking in what sort of condition some of the drivers are in , " a police spokesman told the german wire service dpa . hundreds of officers arrested dozens of people driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol in states surrounding berlin , according to police . though attendance at the parade this year matched the minimum of what organizers said they would need in order to hold it again next year , the parade 's future remains in doubt . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

a government report has found the nation is consuming too much saturated fat which has been linked to heart disease and certain cancers .
experts say our daily diets should not be more than 11 % saturated fat .
but the survey of 1,700 adults found the fats were making up 13.4 % of men 's diets and 13.2 % of women 's .
of that , a quarter comes from milk and cheese , followed by meat and meat products -lrb- 22 % -rrb- , then pizza , bread , biscuits and cakes -lrb- 18 % -rrb- .
despite the findings , the report found people were close to the recommended level for the various types of fat in food added together .
less reassuring was the amount of alcohol being consumed by young drinkers .
fifty-four per cent of men aged 19 to 24 said they drank more than 21 units a week despite advice not to have more than three to four units of alcohol a day -lrb- 21 to 28 units a week -rrb- .
what a tragedy that britons are still failing to eat a healthy diet tim lobstein the food commission half the younger women drinkers in the survey had more than 14 units a week .
it is recommended that women should not have more then two to three units a day -lrb- 14 to 21 units a week -rrb- .
a unit of alcohol is equivalent to half a pint of beer , a single measure of spirits or a glass of wine .
a third of young men in the poll said they drank more than the recommended four units on one day a week , while 26 % of younger women said the same .
recommended limits saturated fat - 11 % alcohol women - 14 to 21 units a week alcohol men - 21 to 28 units a week just 5 % of men and 10 % of women said they never touched alcohol , according to the results .
the survey was commissioned by the food standards agency and the department of health and was carried out between july 2000 and june 2001 .
tim lobstein , director of healthy eating campaign group the food commission , said : " what a tragedy that britons are still failing to eat a healthy diet .
" but it is not individuals ' choice .
you have to lay blame with the industry for heavily promoting fatty foods and government policies that fail to stop them . "
lee lixenberg , of alcohol concern , said : " these results confirm what a number of recent studies have shown .
" people who regularly drink over the recommended limits and are regularly binge drinking are storing up health problems for themselves in later life . "

more than 60,000 orangemen took part in parades in 18 locations throughout the province .
the biggest parade took place in belfast .
bands and orangemen assembled in the north of the city and marched to edenderry , on the outskirts of south belfast , for a religious service and speeches from prominent orangemen .
some of the parades have proved controversial in the past , with violence flaring at interface areas in belfast .

nationalists and loyalists threw bottles and other missiles across police and army lines separating them at ardoyne shops .
the trouble lasted just a few minutes and no-one was seriously hurt .
in londonderry , an orange order parade passed through the centre of the city without incident .
it was the first time in three years that all the lodges in the city had marched on the predominantly nationalist west bank of derry .

the county 's orangemen also marched in garvagh .

in county tyrone , the venues were at cookstown , fivemiletown and fintona , while armagh 's main march took place at markethill .
county down lodges held demonstrations in ballymartin , crossgar , hillsborough , holywood and rathfriland .
