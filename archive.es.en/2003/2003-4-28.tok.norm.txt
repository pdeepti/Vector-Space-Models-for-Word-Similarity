kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.04.2003 having a " conscious party " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pumping with musical energy and righteous passion - the asian dub foundation british sound system asian dub foundation , known for their searing dub , hip-hop and jungle beats and unapologetic anti-racist politics performed in berlin on saturday .
dw-world caught up with bassist and founder dr. das . described as somewhere between punk and hip-hop and playing a blend of reggae , dub , ska and jungle infused with tabla and sitar sounds , asian dub foundation ’ s -lrb- adf -rrb- music has always been difficult to peg down .
emerging from a series of workshops on music in london in 1993 , adf , originally made up of five men of south asian origin , seized attention with their brand of unabashed anti-racist political messages and drum and bass concoction delivered through pulsing live performances .
protests against frequent racist attacks against asians in britain in the early 90s formed much of adf ’ s lyrical content in the early years .
while adf struggled to find acceptance in britain at the time as asian artists , they rose to swift popularity particularly in france , where their second album r.a.f.i. was released in 1997 .
adf is on the road in germany to promote their latest album enemy of the enemy , a steaming mix of political and social statements spanning paranoia over asylum seekers in europe to the threat of terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian dub foundation dr. das hours before their concert in berlin , founder member and bassist of adf , aniruddha das better known as dr. das spoke to dw-world about the band ’ s political views , the experience of being asian in britain , reconciling indian musical traditions with western music and their success in france .
anti-racist messages were the focus of your music in the early years .
how did that come about ?
that was a direct reaction to specific things that were going on in london at the time like the election of a fascist councilor in east london , the rise of the far-right bnp and how that allowed and encouraged racists to come out and attack people in broad daylight literally .
we were people making and teaching music , and so we formed a sound system with microphone and turntables .
for us a sound system is literally direct communication .
we were trying to do as musicians what we could do to talk about the situation and maybe encourage people to put up some kind of resistance .
is there ever a clash between the politically and socially loaded lyrics of your music and the music in itself ?
no , not all .
we don ’ t even analyze it like that .
for us it ’ s all expression , it ’ s about exposing what ’ s going on in our heads .
so whether it ’ s lyrically or musically , we make no distinction .
everything that comes out in the lyrics are things we happen to be talking about as people or concerns that we have as people .
when we started out we were talking about things that were more local , more specific to our experience directly .
now the issues are maybe the same , but it ’ s global .
we ’ ve already talked a lot in the first place about our experience of being " asian " of being the children of immigrants to britain and our experience in britain .
because we ’ ve traveled so much around the world , we ’ ve found that all kinds of people are finding something in our music something that is of relevance to their lives .
that surprised us , to get people from all kinds of musical and cultural backgrounds , that kind of made us think a bit more globally .
has your message changed over the years ?
what is " our " message anyway ?
you think our message is one thing , but we basically want people to be brave and question and to hopefully go out and do their own thing , whether it ’ s music or writing or art or whatever .
we ’ d just like to see more and more people being creative , making their own sound systems , creating their own parties , having exhibitions in their living room , whatever .
how do you think things changed since the sep.11 attacks and how has this affected your music ?
your latest album enemy of the enemy is a reference to the latest u.s.-led war on terror .
i think the world is exactly the same .
i think some people ’ s perception of it has maybe changed , but all the underlying principles of what ’ s going on is exactly the same .
the way cnn reports about what is going on in the world is completely different to what we ’ re getting , so the american population is completely oblivious to why people should want to attack them .
for us , calling our latest album enemy of the enemy is referring to things like that .
people like saddam hussein and osama bin laden were set up as the enemy of the enemy .
america supported saddam hussein , they gave him the chemical capabilities and the so-called weapons of mass destruction .
of course they -lrb- the americans -rrb- know there are weapons of mass destruction , they ’ ve got the receipts !
they set up saddam in the first place , trained him , trained his elite and the same goes for osama .
these are just two of the most obvious , underhand things that have been going on .
we ’ re just saying things aren ’ t as simple as they seem , this whole war on terrorism thing is completely bullshit because who ’ s trained and funded and supplied the terrorists in the first place for what reasons ?
the group public enemy in america , who you ’ ve often been compared to , is known as the cnn for the blacks .
do you see yourself as a kind of cnn for the asians ?
not really .
we do like the idea of alternative news broadcasts .
there is a role for artists and musicians to bring up issues and subject matter or things that the media does not wish to deal with or feel that they ’ re not allowed to deal with .
then you ’ ve got the whole internet thing , you can point people to all sources of information .
so in one respect people are beginning to ignore the media all together .
i know i am , this is the only time i don ’ t ignore the media , when i ’ m being interviewed by them !
we don ’ t mind being compared to the public enemy – they ’ re completely wicked , i just heard them again recently with a track called " son of a bush " .
they ’ re awesome , they started 20-25 years ago and they ’ re just up there doing some amazing innovative music , sonically just completely outrageous , they ’ ve live guitar bass and drums , turntables whatever .
how do you explain the present asian boom in europe ?
everything " asian " is dubbed " cool " .
ask your mates in the media .
it ’ s a media thing .
the same goes for us , i was making music for ten years before adf , five years of that in developing what became adf , you know the mixing of indian sounds and all of that with whatever else we were listening to .
we were just getting on with it all the time .
all this about asians being " cool " – that is so insulting , how can you call a whole group of people , a whole culture cool or uncool ?
i don ’ t relate to that at all .
as for the " asian underground " thing , i think talvin singh originally used that term for his first album or compilation and then it came to be associated with anybody who happened to be of asian origin creating music in britain .
whereas in terms of diversity , the stuff that everybody was doing was completely different .
they just all happen to be asian .
i think the only thing we have in common , which i ’ m very proud of , is asian musicians all embrace technology as well as having a foundation of very rich and old musical traditions to draw upon .
we got straight in there with the technology , the samplers , the sequences , drum machines whatever and had no problem with that whatsoever mixing rap with all the classical instruments , the acoustic stuff .
have you ever performed in india ?
would you like to ?
no , not yet .
but we would now .
in the first half of our existence as adf , it wasn ’ t relevant to us because adf is pretty much about the experience of asian people in britain primarily and other parts of the diaspora .
but now i think we ’ re ready now because i think we ’ ve said pretty much what we wanted to say about our experience in britain and our parents .
our music after all always has references to india , but in a different way – through technology .
a lot of the sounds that you hear , the strings and the percussion , particularly the early stuff , was from our parent ’ s record collection .
i just went back to all the vinyls from my dad ’ s collection that i used to listen to when i was little and just got loads of sounds from there .
now the album for the first time has been released in india , it ’ s the first official release that we ’ ve had .
how do you explain your amazing success in france ?
in the mid-90s , britain was all about brit pop and this retro thing and we were different in every respect – we were using technology , we had different colored skin , things we were talking about ...
in france , they just didn ’ t have a problem with that , they did n't have the baggage of us being asian , we were just another british band .
above all the audiences were well up for hearing new music , whereas in britain at the time they would fold their arms and would not move till someone in the media told them that is cool to move to .
that ’ s how it works .
some of the shops would tell us that they wouldn ’ t stock our stuff because they said asian people don ’ t shop here , white people wouldn ’ t be interested in this at all .
but that was in the early days .
now people realize that we ’ re just playing british music and that anybody can get into it and get something out of it regardless of their cultural origin .
how has the response been in germany this time ?
this is the first tour in germany in two or three years as opposed to coming to the festivals and i notice that there ’ s a change in the vibe , there is a much happier vibe , more party kind of attitude which is good .
i ’ ve been trying to say to people for years that you ’ re just zooming into one aspect of what we do , the fact that we ’ re talking about certain things and totally ignoring the rest of it and in the meantime we ’ re up there on the stage having a party . we don ’ t see a contradiction between talking about things and having a good time - – conscious party -lrb- live album by adf -rrb- . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links asian dub foundation official site 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

bayern munich are champions of germany for the 18th time after a 2-0 victory at wolfsburg this weekend , a victory inspired by the return of michael ballack , german soccer 's most prized asset . it was just a matter of time .
commanding a considerable and consistent lead over second placed vfb stuttgart and with third placed reigning champions borussia dortmund disappearing in the distance , bayern munich have looked champions-elect for the last two months .
however , the 2-0 victory at vfl wolfsburg this weekend was the crowning glory as the bavarian giants secured the bundesliga title with four games to play , thanks to goals from giovane elber and claudio pizarro .
the club 's 18th championship win led chairman karl-heinz rummenigge to proclaim : " it 's the best team we 've ever had . " ballack return inspires victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's contribution has been telling .
an integral part of that team was back in action and as influential as ever at the weekend .
returning from injury after seven weeks out with torn ankle ligaments , michael ballack was instrumental in the victory at wolfsburg , sending a perfect ball through the retreating home defense to set up the crucial first goal for elber on 59 minutes .
in his first season with the club , michael ballack has consistently proved that the € 43 million fee bayern paid to bring him from bayer leverkusen at the end of last season was money well spent .
ballack himself said after the win , " we had a good time out there today .
although we have not done well in the champions league , we have proven we are a good team with good individual players by being so dominant in the league . "
comparing this season of success to the previous campaign when he finished a runner-up in three competitions with bayer leverkusen , ballack added , " i 'm just glad to have won something after last season when i got nothing . "
in the glow of victory , his coach , ottmar hitzfeld , singled ballack out for praise : " it was superb that ballack was on the pitch and his class spoke for itself .
he was the decisive man and he put us back on course for success . "
ballack 's rise to the pinnacle of the german game is as meteoric as any in the history of the bundesliga .
after leaving school in 1995 , it took just three years and two clubs to reach the dizzy heights of the first division and his first professional accolade .
after working his way through the youth sides of local team f.c. chemnitzer , ballack was signed by f.c. kaiserslautern in 1997 after impressive displays for the german national under-21 team .
champion at 22 ballack was an instrumental part of the kaiserslautern side won the league in 1998 .
even then as a 22-year-old , comparisons were being made between the east german-born prodigy and the great midfield stars of german soccer , namely bayern director franz beckenbauer .
he was a regular in the following campaign and caught the attention of then-germany coach erick ribbeck , who gave ballack his first full cap for germany in april 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucky 13 .
that year , ballack moved to bayer leverkusen for € 3.6 million where he chose the number 13 shirt , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little , " he admitted .
then things seemed to turn a little sour for the great young hope .
first he got injured and then on his return , he scored an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at the european championships in 2000 , he played only 63 minutes of germany 's inauspicious campaign .
technical change brings brilliance when domestic duties resumed , leverkusen 's coach klaus toppmöller converted ballack from a defensive midfield player into a marauding attacking star and an exceptional footballer .
as a result , bigger clubs came sniffing around .
he was courted by real madrid and barcelona before finally agreeing to move to bayern at the end of the 2001/02 season .
during his last year with leverkusen , ballack helped the team push bayern munich all the way in the championship race until the final day of the season .
his efforts also inspired leverkusen to battle through to the final of the german cup and the european champions league final .
disappointingly , leverkusen dramatically faltered on each occasion and their season ended empty-handed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and ballack were central to germany 's world cup campaign .
but his reputation remained intact and was enhanced by match saving performances during germany 's surprisingly successful world cup campaign in japan / korea in 2002 .
despite more disappointment at missing the final through suspension , compounded by the 2-0 defeat by brazil , ballack was undoubtedly one of the stars of the tournament .
now , back on a winning streak , michael ballack looks set to go on and fulfil the dreams of a nation that has watched him grow up with great expectation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is bayern munich about to self destruct ?
they had it all : european cups , bundesliga championship titles and the adoration of millions worldwide .
now bayern munich faces its biggest test - holding the team together despite public rows and loss of form .

bayern munich are champions of germany for the 18th time after a 2-0 victory at wolfsburg this weekend , a victory inspired by the return of michael ballack , german soccer 's most prized asset . it was just a matter of time .
commanding a considerable and consistent lead over second placed vfb stuttgart and with third placed reigning champions borussia dortmund disappearing in the distance , bayern munich have looked champions-elect for the last two months .
however , the 2-0 victory at vfl wolfsburg this weekend was the crowning glory as the bavarian giants secured the bundesliga title with four games to play , thanks to goals from giovane elber and claudio pizarro .
the club 's 18th championship win led chairman karl-heinz rummenigge to proclaim : " it 's the best team we 've ever had . " ballack return inspires victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's contribution has been telling .
an integral part of that team was back in action and as influential as ever at the weekend .
returning from injury after seven weeks out with torn ankle ligaments , michael ballack was instrumental in the victory at wolfsburg , sending a perfect ball through the retreating home defense to set up the crucial first goal for elber on 59 minutes .
in his first season with the club , michael ballack has consistently proved that the € 43 million fee bayern paid to bring him from bayer leverkusen at the end of last season was money well spent .
ballack himself said after the win , " we had a good time out there today .
although we have not done well in the champions league , we have proven we are a good team with good individual players by being so dominant in the league . "
comparing this season of success to the previous campaign when he finished a runner-up in three competitions with bayer leverkusen , ballack added , " i 'm just glad to have won something after last season when i got nothing . "
in the glow of victory , his coach , ottmar hitzfeld , singled ballack out for praise : " it was superb that ballack was on the pitch and his class spoke for itself .
he was the decisive man and he put us back on course for success . "
ballack 's rise to the pinnacle of the german game is as meteoric as any in the history of the bundesliga .
after leaving school in 1995 , it took just three years and two clubs to reach the dizzy heights of the first division and his first professional accolade .
after working his way through the youth sides of local team f.c. chemnitzer , ballack was signed by f.c. kaiserslautern in 1997 after impressive displays for the german national under-21 team .
champion at 22 ballack was an instrumental part of the kaiserslautern side won the league in 1998 .
even then as a 22-year-old , comparisons were being made between the east german-born prodigy and the great midfield stars of german soccer , namely bayern director franz beckenbauer .
he was a regular in the following campaign and caught the attention of then-germany coach erick ribbeck , who gave ballack his first full cap for germany in april 1999 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucky 13 .
that year , ballack moved to bayer leverkusen for € 3.6 million where he chose the number 13 shirt , once the property of local hero rudi völler , " to provoke a little , " he admitted .
then things seemed to turn a little sour for the great young hope .
first he got injured and then on his return , he scored an own goal that cost leverkusen the bundesliga title - he cried on the pitch afterwards - and at the european championships in 2000 , he played only 63 minutes of germany 's inauspicious campaign .
technical change brings brilliance when domestic duties resumed , leverkusen 's coach klaus toppmöller converted ballack from a defensive midfield player into a marauding attacking star and an exceptional footballer .
as a result , bigger clubs came sniffing around .
he was courted by real madrid and barcelona before finally agreeing to move to bayern at the end of the 2001/02 season .
during his last year with leverkusen , ballack helped the team push bayern munich all the way in the championship race until the final day of the season .
his efforts also inspired leverkusen to battle through to the final of the german cup and the european champions league final .
disappointingly , leverkusen dramatically faltered on each occasion and their season ended empty-handed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and ballack were central to germany 's world cup campaign .
but his reputation remained intact and was enhanced by match saving performances during germany 's surprisingly successful world cup campaign in japan / korea in 2002 .
despite more disappointment at missing the final through suspension , compounded by the 2-0 defeat by brazil , ballack was undoubtedly one of the stars of the tournament .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.04.2003 having a " conscious party " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pumping with musical energy and righteous passion - the asian dub foundation british sound system asian dub foundation , known for their searing dub , hip-hop and jungle beats and unapologetic anti-racist politics performed in berlin on saturday .
dw-world caught up with bassist and founder dr. das . described as somewhere between punk and hip-hop and playing a blend of reggae , dub , ska and jungle infused with tabla and sitar sounds , asian dub foundation ’ s -lrb- adf -rrb- music has always been difficult to peg down .
emerging from a series of workshops on music in london in 1993 , adf , originally made up of five men of south asian origin , seized attention with their brand of unabashed anti-racist political messages and drum and bass concoction delivered through pulsing live performances .
protests against frequent racist attacks against asians in britain in the early 90s formed much of adf ’ s lyrical content in the early years .
while adf struggled to find acceptance in britain at the time as asian artists , they rose to swift popularity particularly in france , where their second album r.a.f.i. was released in 1997 .
adf is on the road in germany to promote their latest album enemy of the enemy , a steaming mix of political and social statements spanning paranoia over asylum seekers in europe to the threat of terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian dub foundation dr. das hours before their concert in berlin , founder member and bassist of adf , aniruddha das better known as dr. das spoke to dw-world about the band ’ s political views , the experience of being asian in britain , reconciling indian musical traditions with western music and their success in france .
anti-racist messages were the focus of your music in the early years .
how did that come about ?
that was a direct reaction to specific things that were going on in london at the time like the election of a fascist councilor in east london , the rise of the far-right bnp and how that allowed and encouraged racists to come out and attack people in broad daylight literally .
we were people making and teaching music , and so we formed a sound system with microphone and turntables .
for us a sound system is literally direct communication .
we were trying to do as musicians what we could do to talk about the situation and maybe encourage people to put up some kind of resistance .
is there ever a clash between the politically and socially loaded lyrics of your music and the music in itself ?
no , not all .
we don ’ t even analyze it like that .
for us it ’ s all expression , it ’ s about exposing what ’ s going on in our heads .
so whether it ’ s lyrically or musically , we make no distinction .
everything that comes out in the lyrics are things we happen to be talking about as people or concerns that we have as people .
when we started out we were talking about things that were more local , more specific to our experience directly .
now the issues are maybe the same , but it ’ s global .
we ’ ve already talked a lot in the first place about our experience of being " asian " of being the children of immigrants to britain and our experience in britain .
because we ’ ve traveled so much around the world , we ’ ve found that all kinds of people are finding something in our music something that is of relevance to their lives .
that surprised us , to get people from all kinds of musical and cultural backgrounds , that kind of made us think a bit more globally .
has your message changed over the years ?
what is " our " message anyway ?
you think our message is one thing , but we basically want people to be brave and question and to hopefully go out and do their own thing , whether it ’ s music or writing or art or whatever .
we ’ d just like to see more and more people being creative , making their own sound systems , creating their own parties , having exhibitions in their living room , whatever .
how do you think things changed since the sep.11 attacks and how has this affected your music ?
your latest album enemy of the enemy is a reference to the latest u.s.-led war on terror .
i think the world is exactly the same .
i think some people ’ s perception of it has maybe changed , but all the underlying principles of what ’ s going on is exactly the same .
the way cnn reports about what is going on in the world is completely different to what we ’ re getting , so the american population is completely oblivious to why people should want to attack them .
for us , calling our latest album enemy of the enemy is referring to things like that .
people like saddam hussein and osama bin laden were set up as the enemy of the enemy .
america supported saddam hussein , they gave him the chemical capabilities and the so-called weapons of mass destruction .
of course they -lrb- the americans -rrb- know there are weapons of mass destruction , they ’ ve got the receipts !
they set up saddam in the first place , trained him , trained his elite and the same goes for osama .
these are just two of the most obvious , underhand things that have been going on .
we ’ re just saying things aren ’ t as simple as they seem , this whole war on terrorism thing is completely bullshit because who ’ s trained and funded and supplied the terrorists in the first place for what reasons ?
the group public enemy in america , who you ’ ve often been compared to , is known as the cnn for the blacks .
do you see yourself as a kind of cnn for the asians ?
not really .
we do like the idea of alternative news broadcasts .
there is a role for artists and musicians to bring up issues and subject matter or things that the media does not wish to deal with or feel that they ’ re not allowed to deal with .
then you ’ ve got the whole internet thing , you can point people to all sources of information .
so in one respect people are beginning to ignore the media all together .
i know i am , this is the only time i don ’ t ignore the media , when i ’ m being interviewed by them !
we don ’ t mind being compared to the public enemy – they ’ re completely wicked , i just heard them again recently with a track called " son of a bush " .
they ’ re awesome , they started 20-25 years ago and they ’ re just up there doing some amazing innovative music , sonically just completely outrageous , they ’ ve live guitar bass and drums , turntables whatever .
how do you explain the present asian boom in europe ?
everything " asian " is dubbed " cool " .
ask your mates in the media .
it ’ s a media thing .
the same goes for us , i was making music for ten years before adf , five years of that in developing what became adf , you know the mixing of indian sounds and all of that with whatever else we were listening to .
we were just getting on with it all the time .
all this about asians being " cool " – that is so insulting , how can you call a whole group of people , a whole culture cool or uncool ?
i don ’ t relate to that at all .
as for the " asian underground " thing , i think talvin singh originally used that term for his first album or compilation and then it came to be associated with anybody who happened to be of asian origin creating music in britain .
whereas in terms of diversity , the stuff that everybody was doing was completely different .
they just all happen to be asian .
i think the only thing we have in common , which i ’ m very proud of , is asian musicians all embrace technology as well as having a foundation of very rich and old musical traditions to draw upon .
we got straight in there with the technology , the samplers , the sequences , drum machines whatever and had no problem with that whatsoever mixing rap with all the classical instruments , the acoustic stuff .
have you ever performed in india ?
would you like to ?
no , not yet .
but we would now .
in the first half of our existence as adf , it wasn ’ t relevant to us because adf is pretty much about the experience of asian people in britain primarily and other parts of the diaspora .
but now i think we ’ re ready now because i think we ’ ve said pretty much what we wanted to say about our experience in britain and our parents .
our music after all always has references to india , but in a different way – through technology .
a lot of the sounds that you hear , the strings and the percussion , particularly the early stuff , was from our parent ’ s record collection .
i just went back to all the vinyls from my dad ’ s collection that i used to listen to when i was little and just got loads of sounds from there .
now the album for the first time has been released in india , it ’ s the first official release that we ’ ve had .
how do you explain your amazing success in france ?
in the mid-90s , britain was all about brit pop and this retro thing and we were different in every respect – we were using technology , we had different colored skin , things we were talking about ...
in france , they just didn ’ t have a problem with that , they did n't have the baggage of us being asian , we were just another british band .
above all the audiences were well up for hearing new music , whereas in britain at the time they would fold their arms and would not move till someone in the media told them that is cool to move to .
that ’ s how it works .
some of the shops would tell us that they wouldn ’ t stock our stuff because they said asian people don ’ t shop here , white people wouldn ’ t be interested in this at all .
but that was in the early days .
now people realize that we ’ re just playing british music and that anybody can get into it and get something out of it regardless of their cultural origin .
how has the response been in germany this time ?
this is the first tour in germany in two or three years as opposed to coming to the festivals and i notice that there ’ s a change in the vibe , there is a much happier vibe , more party kind of attitude which is good .
i ’ ve been trying to say to people for years that you ’ re just zooming into one aspect of what we do , the fact that we ’ re talking about certain things and totally ignoring the rest of it and in the meantime we ’ re up there on the stage having a party . we don ’ t see a contradiction between talking about things and having a good time - – conscious party -lrb- live album by adf -rrb- . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links asian dub foundation official site 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

bayern munich are champions of germany for the 18th time after a 2-0 victory at wolfsburg this weekend , a victory inspired by the return of michael ballack , german soccer 's most prized asset . it was just a matter of time .
commanding a considerable and consistent lead over second placed vfb stuttgart and with third placed reigning champions borussia dortmund disappearing in the distance , bayern munich have looked champions-elect for the last two months .
however , the 2-0 victory at vfl wolfsburg this weekend was the crowning glory as the bavarian giants secured the bundesliga title with four games to play , thanks to goals from giovane elber and claudio pizarro .
the club 's 18th championship win led chairman karl-heinz rummenigge to proclaim : " it 's the best team we 've ever had . " ballack return inspires victory bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack 's contribution has been telling .
an integral part of that team was back in action and as influential as ever at the weekend .
returning from injury after seven weeks out with torn ankle ligaments , michael ballack was instrumental in the victory at wolfsburg , sending a perfect ball through the retreating home defense to set up the crucial first goal for elber on 59 minutes .
in his first season with the club , michael ballack has consistently proved that the € 43 million fee bayern paid to bring him from bayer leverkusen at the end of last season was money well spent .
ballack himself said after the win , " we had a good time out there today .
although we have not done well in the champions league , we have proven we are a good team with good individual players by being so dominant in the league . "
comparing this season of success to the previous campaign when he finished a runner-up in three competitions with bayer leverkusen , ballack added , " i 'm just glad to have won something after last season when i got nothing . "
in the glow of victory , his coach , ottmar hitzfeld , singled ballack out for praise : " it was superb that ballack was on the pitch and his class spoke for itself .
he was the decisive man and he put us back on course for success . "
ballack 's rise to the pinnacle of the german game is as meteoric as any in the history of the bundesliga .
after leaving school in 1995 , it took just three years and two clubs to reach the dizzy heights of the first division and his first professional accolade .
after working his way through the youth sides of local team f.c. chemnitzer , ballack was signed by f.c. kaiserslautern in 1997 after impressive displays for the german national under-21 team .
champion at 22 ballack was an instrumental part of the kaiserslautern side won the league in 1998 .
even then as a 22-year-old , comparisons were being made between the east german-born prodigy and the great midfield stars of german soccer , namely bayern director franz beckenbauer .
he was a regular in the following campaign and caught the attention of then-germany coach erick ribbeck , who gave ballack his first full cap for germany in april 1999 .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support plans to reform the welfare system and boost the economy , as the government lowered its official growth forecast for 2003 . in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , schröder said those opposed to his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms were endangering his ability to govern . “ anyone who wants to vote for or push through anything else has to know that they are removing the foundation of my work and are forcing me to deal with the consequences , ” schröder told journalists before a meeting with spd leaders in berlin . the party leadership voted to back the government ’ s reform agenda at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 .
the reforms , which aim to cut unemployment benefits and make it easier for firms to hire and fire , have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing spd hardliners .
four members of the spd leadership voted against the proposals at monday ’ s meeting . refusing to back down having staked his political future on the implementation of agenda 2010 , schröder refused to placate the left-wing hardliners : “ there is no reason to think about changes . ”
in an attempt to build more momentum for his reform proposals , schröder will hold the first of four regional spd conferences in bonn later on monday . germany ’ s economy has in recent years ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at around 11 percent . as if to highlight the urgency of undertaking the painful reforms , schröder ’ s government on monday also cut its official growth forecast for 2003 .
instead of its previous forecast of 1 percent , the economy ministry now expects europe ’ s largest economy to expand only 0.75 percent this year . the slower growth makes it more likely that germany will not meet the european union 's 3 percent budget deficit target in 2003 for the second year in a row . still seen as too high but the downward revision is still higher than more pessimistic forecasts from the international monetary fund , the oecd , european commission and germany 's six leading institutes , which expect the economy to expand between 0.3 and 0.5 percent in 2003 . “ this -lrb- government -rrb- forecast is irresponsible considering the actual economic developments and the continuing economic and finance policy mistakes , ” rudolf hickel , the director of the european economic institute in bremen , told the german news agency dpa . the official revision came as germany 's closely-watched ifo business climate index unexpectedly fell in april despite the end of the war in iraq which had been expected to boost sentiment .
the munich-based ifo economic institute said the index dropped to 86.6 from 88.1in march , as firms remained skeptical over the prospects for the coming months . in further gloomy news , credit insurer hermes said on monday there was likely to be record number of bankruptcies in germany this year .
the subsidiary of financial services giant allianz said it expected around 44,000 firms to declare insolvency in 2003 , the highest level in 12 years .
losses from insolvencies are expected to total around € 50 billion -lrb- $ billion -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder unable to quell opposition to reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder has increased the pressure on critics in his own party who reject the government ’ s planned social and welfare reforms .

a european defense summit held by four nations that opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq begins in brussels on tuesday .
but france and germany , anxious to mend ties with the u.s. , are now playing down its importance . a defense summit in brussels on tuesday , originally meant to reinforce plans for an integrated european defense policy , has largely downsized its ambitions in the face of growing skepticism and criticism .
the mini-summit called by belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt will see leaders of germany , france and luxembourg , all strongly opposed to the u.s.-led war against iraq , meeting for a half-day of talks in brussels .
among other things they are expected to discuss controversial proposals by verhofstadt for a european military headquarters separate from nato , specific defense spending targets and placing all multinational forces in the eu under a central command .
summit originally planned to bolster european defense verhofstadt launched the idea for the defense summit at the start of the iraq war , at a time when the european union was split on the bush administration ’ s war plans .
the original aim was to beef up eu defense , thereby giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the u.s. the summit participants also hoped to form a core group of like-minded states to push ahead with defense integration .
the belgian premier said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war .
though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion initially in particular of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s most effective military power alongside france .
france and germany backpedal initial enthusiasm the swift victory of the u.s. and britain in iraq , has seen the original drive to bolster european defense among the nations that support the summit fading .
in particular france and germany , eager to repair strained ties with the u.s. and britain , have now turned into reluctant supporters of the event .
" the timing could not have been more unfortunate .
the french and the germans want as low a profile as possible .
the less we talk about it the better , " one eu diplomat told reuters .
french president chirac , who angered the u.s. when he said paris would use its veto to block any security council resolution allowing the use of force in iraq , is now desperate to get back into washington ’ s good books .
it is believed that chirac is now anxious to avoid a european defense policy independent of the u.s.-led nato military alliance .
" chirac wants this summit to be as unprovocative as possible , " an eu diplomat told the financial times .
" at the same time he wants to support the idea of a stronger european defense policy .
it may be a difficult balancing act . "
schröder under pressure likewise german chancellor schröder , who was a vocal opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq and is now eager to repair frayed ties with washington , is playing down the significance of the summit .
schröder is also under pressure from the conservative opposition in germany , who have said that the summit will only further divisions in a europe already deeply split over iraq .
last week angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- renewed her party ’ s call to boycott the summit .
she reiterated that a new defense grouping could be used to decouple europe from nato and the transatlantic alliance with the united states .
" in my opinion it ’ s important , especially considering the limited defense budget that we have in germany , to strengthen nato and european security policy rather than just part of nato .
we shouldn ’ t forge new alliances , " merkel said .
prominent members to stay away apart from france and germany ’ s reluctance to publicize the defense summit , the meeting on tuesday also suffers from prominent absences .
greece , the current eu president , will not be attending , nor will javier solana , the eu ’ s foreign policy chief .
british officials say they were not invited and add that the summit is unnecessary , while the netherlands and italy , the other two founding members of the eu , were also not invited .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support plans to reform the welfare system and boost the economy , as the government lowered its official growth forecast for 2003 . in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , schröder said those opposed to his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms were endangering his ability to govern . “ anyone who wants to vote for or push through anything else has to know that they are removing the foundation of my work and are forcing me to deal with the consequences , ” schröder told journalists before a meeting with spd leaders in berlin . the party leadership voted to back the government ’ s reform agenda at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 .
the reforms , which aim to cut unemployment benefits and make it easier for firms to hire and fire , have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing spd hardliners .
four members of the spd leadership voted against the proposals at monday ’ s meeting . refusing to back down having staked his political future on the implementation of agenda 2010 , schröder refused to placate the left-wing hardliners : “ there is no reason to think about changes . ”
in an attempt to build more momentum for his reform proposals , schröder will hold the first of four regional spd conferences in bonn later on monday . germany ’ s economy has in recent years ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at around 11 percent . as if to highlight the urgency of undertaking the painful reforms , schröder ’ s government on monday also cut its official growth forecast for 2003 .
instead of its previous forecast of 1 percent , the economy ministry now expects europe ’ s largest economy to expand only 0.75 percent this year . the slower growth makes it more likely that germany will not meet the european union 's 3 percent budget deficit target in 2003 for the second year in a row . still seen as too high but the downward revision is still higher than more pessimistic forecasts from the international monetary fund , the oecd , european commission and germany 's six leading institutes , which expect the economy to expand between 0.3 and 0.5 percent in 2003 . “ this -lrb- government -rrb- forecast is irresponsible considering the actual economic developments and the continuing economic and finance policy mistakes , ” rudolf hickel , the director of the european economic institute in bremen , told the german news agency dpa . the official revision came as germany 's closely-watched ifo business climate index unexpectedly fell in april despite the end of the war in iraq which had been expected to boost sentiment .
the munich-based ifo economic institute said the index dropped to 86.6 from 88.1in march , as firms remained skeptical over the prospects for the coming months . in further gloomy news , credit insurer hermes said on monday there was likely to be record number of bankruptcies in germany this year .
the subsidiary of financial services giant allianz said it expected around 44,000 firms to declare insolvency in 2003 , the highest level in 12 years .
losses from insolvencies are expected to total around € 50 billion -lrb- $ billion -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder unable to quell opposition to reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder has increased the pressure on critics in his own party who reject the government ’ s planned social and welfare reforms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.04.2003 defense summit held by four eu nations wants a low profile großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu defense summit is expected to discuss plans for an independent european defense force .
a european defense summit held by four nations that opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq begins in brussels on tuesday .
but france and germany , anxious to mend ties with the u.s. , are now playing down its importance . a defense summit in brussels on tuesday , originally meant to reinforce plans for an integrated european defense policy , has largely downsized its ambitions in the face of growing skepticism and criticism .
the mini-summit called by belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt will see leaders of germany , france and luxembourg , all strongly opposed to the u.s.-led war against iraq , meeting for a half-day of talks in brussels .
among other things they are expected to discuss controversial proposals by verhofstadt for a european military headquarters separate from nato , specific defense spending targets and placing all multinational forces in the eu under a central command .
summit originally planned to bolster european defense verhofstadt launched the idea for the defense summit at the start of the iraq war , at a time when the european union was split on the bush administration ’ s war plans .
the original aim was to beef up eu defense , thereby giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the u.s. the summit participants also hoped to form a core group of like-minded states to push ahead with defense integration .
the belgian premier said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war .
though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion initially in particular of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s most effective military power alongside france .
france and germany backpedal initial enthusiasm the swift victory of the u.s. and britain in iraq , has seen the original drive to bolster european defense among the nations that support the summit fading .
in particular france and germany , eager to repair strained ties with the u.s. and britain , have now turned into reluctant supporters of the event .
" the timing could not have been more unfortunate .
the french and the germans want as low a profile as possible .
the less we talk about it the better , " one eu diplomat told reuters .
french president chirac , who angered the u.s. when he said paris would use its veto to block any security council resolution allowing the use of force in iraq , is now desperate to get back into washington ’ s good books .
it is believed that chirac is now anxious to avoid a european defense policy independent of the u.s.-led nato military alliance .
" chirac wants this summit to be as unprovocative as possible , " an eu diplomat told the financial times .
" at the same time he wants to support the idea of a stronger european defense policy .
it may be a difficult balancing act . "
schröder under pressure likewise german chancellor schröder , who was a vocal opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq and is now eager to repair frayed ties with washington , is playing down the significance of the summit .
schröder is also under pressure from the conservative opposition in germany , who have said that the summit will only further divisions in a europe already deeply split over iraq .
last week angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- renewed her party ’ s call to boycott the summit .
she reiterated that a new defense grouping could be used to decouple europe from nato and the transatlantic alliance with the united states .
" in my opinion it ’ s important , especially considering the limited defense budget that we have in germany , to strengthen nato and european security policy rather than just part of nato .
we shouldn ’ t forge new alliances , " merkel said .
prominent members to stay away apart from france and germany ’ s reluctance to publicize the defense summit , the meeting on tuesday also suffers from prominent absences .
greece , the current eu president , will not be attending , nor will javier solana , the eu ’ s foreign policy chief .
british officials say they were not invited and add that the summit is unnecessary , while the netherlands and italy , the other two founding members of the eu , were also not invited .
" this is a very wobbly summit-like gathering , " a dutch foreign ministry official told the financial times .
" it is bad on timing , bad on content and bad on the participating states .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.04.2003 having a " conscious party " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pumping with musical energy and righteous passion - the asian dub foundation british sound system asian dub foundation , known for their searing dub , hip-hop and jungle beats and unapologetic anti-racist politics performed in berlin on saturday .
dw-world caught up with bassist and founder dr. das . described as somewhere between punk and hip-hop and playing a blend of reggae , dub , ska and jungle infused with tabla and sitar sounds , asian dub foundation ’ s -lrb- adf -rrb- music has always been difficult to peg down .
emerging from a series of workshops on music in london in 1993 , adf , originally made up of five men of south asian origin , seized attention with their brand of unabashed anti-racist political messages and drum and bass concoction delivered through pulsing live performances .
protests against frequent racist attacks against asians in britain in the early 90s formed much of adf ’ s lyrical content in the early years .
while adf struggled to find acceptance in britain at the time as asian artists , they rose to swift popularity particularly in france , where their second album r.a.f.i. was released in 1997 .
adf is on the road in germany to promote their latest album enemy of the enemy , a steaming mix of political and social statements spanning paranoia over asylum seekers in europe to the threat of terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian dub foundation dr. das hours before their concert in berlin , founder member and bassist of adf , aniruddha das better known as dr. das spoke to dw-world about the band ’ s political views , the experience of being asian in britain , reconciling indian musical traditions with western music and their success in france .
anti-racist messages were the focus of your music in the early years .
how did that come about ?
that was a direct reaction to specific things that were going on in london at the time like the election of a fascist councilor in east london , the rise of the far-right bnp and how that allowed and encouraged racists to come out and attack people in broad daylight literally .
we were people making and teaching music , and so we formed a sound system with microphone and turntables .
for us a sound system is literally direct communication .
we were trying to do as musicians what we could do to talk about the situation and maybe encourage people to put up some kind of resistance .
is there ever a clash between the politically and socially loaded lyrics of your music and the music in itself ?
no , not all .
we don ’ t even analyze it like that .
for us it ’ s all expression , it ’ s about exposing what ’ s going on in our heads .
so whether it ’ s lyrically or musically , we make no distinction .
everything that comes out in the lyrics are things we happen to be talking about as people or concerns that we have as people .
when we started out we were talking about things that were more local , more specific to our experience directly .
now the issues are maybe the same , but it ’ s global .
we ’ ve already talked a lot in the first place about our experience of being " asian " of being the children of immigrants to britain and our experience in britain .
because we ’ ve traveled so much around the world , we ’ ve found that all kinds of people are finding something in our music something that is of relevance to their lives .
that surprised us , to get people from all kinds of musical and cultural backgrounds , that kind of made us think a bit more globally .
has your message changed over the years ?
what is " our " message anyway ?
you think our message is one thing , but we basically want people to be brave and question and to hopefully go out and do their own thing , whether it ’ s music or writing or art or whatever .
we ’ d just like to see more and more people being creative , making their own sound systems , creating their own parties , having exhibitions in their living room , whatever .
how do you think things changed since the sep.11 attacks and how has this affected your music ?
your latest album enemy of the enemy is a reference to the latest u.s.-led war on terror .
i think the world is exactly the same .
i think some people ’ s perception of it has maybe changed , but all the underlying principles of what ’ s going on is exactly the same .
the way cnn reports about what is going on in the world is completely different to what we ’ re getting , so the american population is completely oblivious to why people should want to attack them .
for us , calling our latest album enemy of the enemy is referring to things like that .
people like saddam hussein and osama bin laden were set up as the enemy of the enemy .
america supported saddam hussein , they gave him the chemical capabilities and the so-called weapons of mass destruction .
of course they -lrb- the americans -rrb- know there are weapons of mass destruction , they ’ ve got the receipts !
they set up saddam in the first place , trained him , trained his elite and the same goes for osama .
these are just two of the most obvious , underhand things that have been going on .
we ’ re just saying things aren ’ t as simple as they seem , this whole war on terrorism thing is completely bullshit because who ’ s trained and funded and supplied the terrorists in the first place for what reasons ?
the group public enemy in america , who you ’ ve often been compared to , is known as the cnn for the blacks .
do you see yourself as a kind of cnn for the asians ?
not really .
we do like the idea of alternative news broadcasts .
there is a role for artists and musicians to bring up issues and subject matter or things that the media does not wish to deal with or feel that they ’ re not allowed to deal with .
then you ’ ve got the whole internet thing , you can point people to all sources of information .
so in one respect people are beginning to ignore the media all together .
i know i am , this is the only time i don ’ t ignore the media , when i ’ m being interviewed by them !
we don ’ t mind being compared to the public enemy – they ’ re completely wicked , i just heard them again recently with a track called " son of a bush " .
they ’ re awesome , they started 20-25 years ago and they ’ re just up there doing some amazing innovative music , sonically just completely outrageous , they ’ ve live guitar bass and drums , turntables whatever .
how do you explain the present asian boom in europe ?
everything " asian " is dubbed " cool " .
ask your mates in the media .
it ’ s a media thing .
the same goes for us , i was making music for ten years before adf , five years of that in developing what became adf , you know the mixing of indian sounds and all of that with whatever else we were listening to .
we were just getting on with it all the time .
all this about asians being " cool " – that is so insulting , how can you call a whole group of people , a whole culture cool or uncool ?
i don ’ t relate to that at all .
as for the " asian underground " thing , i think talvin singh originally used that term for his first album or compilation and then it came to be associated with anybody who happened to be of asian origin creating music in britain .
whereas in terms of diversity , the stuff that everybody was doing was completely different .
they just all happen to be asian .
i think the only thing we have in common , which i ’ m very proud of , is asian musicians all embrace technology as well as having a foundation of very rich and old musical traditions to draw upon .
we got straight in there with the technology , the samplers , the sequences , drum machines whatever and had no problem with that whatsoever mixing rap with all the classical instruments , the acoustic stuff .
have you ever performed in india ?
would you like to ?
no , not yet .
but we would now .
in the first half of our existence as adf , it wasn ’ t relevant to us because adf is pretty much about the experience of asian people in britain primarily and other parts of the diaspora .
but now i think we ’ re ready now because i think we ’ ve said pretty much what we wanted to say about our experience in britain and our parents .
our music after all always has references to india , but in a different way – through technology .
a lot of the sounds that you hear , the strings and the percussion , particularly the early stuff , was from our parent ’ s record collection .
i just went back to all the vinyls from my dad ’ s collection that i used to listen to when i was little and just got loads of sounds from there .
now the album for the first time has been released in india , it ’ s the first official release that we ’ ve had .
how do you explain your amazing success in france ?
in the mid-90s , britain was all about brit pop and this retro thing and we were different in every respect – we were using technology , we had different colored skin , things we were talking about ...
in france , they just didn ’ t have a problem with that , they did n't have the baggage of us being asian , we were just another british band .
above all the audiences were well up for hearing new music , whereas in britain at the time they would fold their arms and would not move till someone in the media told them that is cool to move to .
that ’ s how it works .
some of the shops would tell us that they wouldn ’ t stock our stuff because they said asian people don ’ t shop here , white people wouldn ’ t be interested in this at all .
but that was in the early days .
now people realize that we ’ re just playing british music and that anybody can get into it and get something out of it regardless of their cultural origin .
how has the response been in germany this time ?
this is the first tour in germany in two or three years as opposed to coming to the festivals and i notice that there ’ s a change in the vibe , there is a much happier vibe , more party kind of attitude which is good .
i ’ ve been trying to say to people for years that you ’ re just zooming into one aspect of what we do , the fact that we ’ re talking about certain things and totally ignoring the rest of it and in the meantime we ’ re up there on the stage having a party . we don ’ t see a contradiction between talking about things and having a good time - – conscious party -lrb- live album by adf -rrb- . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links asian dub foundation official site 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

all this about asians being " cool " – that is so insulting , how can you call a whole group of people , a whole culture cool or uncool ?
i don ’ t relate to that at all .
as for the " asian underground " thing , i think talvin singh originally used that term for his first album or compilation and then it came to be associated with anybody who happened to be of asian origin creating music in britain .
whereas in terms of diversity , the stuff that everybody was doing was completely different .
they just all happen to be asian .
i think the only thing we have in common , which i ’ m very proud of , is asian musicians all embrace technology as well as having a foundation of very rich and old musical traditions to draw upon .
we got straight in there with the technology , the samplers , the sequences , drum machines whatever and had no problem with that whatsoever mixing rap with all the classical instruments , the acoustic stuff .
have you ever performed in india ?
would you like to ?
no , not yet .
but we would now .
in the first half of our existence as adf , it wasn ’ t relevant to us because adf is pretty much about the experience of asian people in britain primarily and other parts of the diaspora .
but now i think we ’ re ready now because i think we ’ ve said pretty much what we wanted to say about our experience in britain and our parents .
our music after all always has references to india , but in a different way – through technology .
a lot of the sounds that you hear , the strings and the percussion , particularly the early stuff , was from our parent ’ s record collection .
i just went back to all the vinyls from my dad ’ s collection that i used to listen to when i was little and just got loads of sounds from there .
now the album for the first time has been released in india , it ’ s the first official release that we ’ ve had .
how do you explain your amazing success in france ?
in the mid-90s , britain was all about brit pop and this retro thing and we were different in every respect – we were using technology , we had different colored skin , things we were talking about ...
in france , they just didn ’ t have a problem with that , they did n't have the baggage of us being asian , we were just another british band .
above all the audiences were well up for hearing new music , whereas in britain at the time they would fold their arms and would not move till someone in the media told them that is cool to move to .
that ’ s how it works .
some of the shops would tell us that they wouldn ’ t stock our stuff because they said asian people don ’ t shop here , white people wouldn ’ t be interested in this at all .
but that was in the early days .
now people realize that we ’ re just playing british music and that anybody can get into it and get something out of it regardless of their cultural origin .
how has the response been in germany this time ?
this is the first tour in germany in two or three years as opposed to coming to the festivals and i notice that there ’ s a change in the vibe , there is a much happier vibe , more party kind of attitude which is good .
i ’ ve been trying to say to people for years that you ’ re just zooming into one aspect of what we do , the fact that we ’ re talking about certain things and totally ignoring the rest of it and in the meantime we ’ re up there on the stage having a party . we don ’ t see a contradiction between talking about things and having a good time - – conscious party -lrb- live album by adf -rrb- . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links asian dub foundation official site 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

kraftwerk is back berlin ’ s music magnet attracts popkomm cracking down on bootlegs the love parade is dead , long live the love parade culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.04.2003 having a " conscious party " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pumping with musical energy and righteous passion - the asian dub foundation british sound system asian dub foundation , known for their searing dub , hip-hop and jungle beats and unapologetic anti-racist politics performed in berlin on saturday .
dw-world caught up with bassist and founder dr. das . described as somewhere between punk and hip-hop and playing a blend of reggae , dub , ska and jungle infused with tabla and sitar sounds , asian dub foundation ’ s -lrb- adf -rrb- music has always been difficult to peg down .
emerging from a series of workshops on music in london in 1993 , adf , originally made up of five men of south asian origin , seized attention with their brand of unabashed anti-racist political messages and drum and bass concoction delivered through pulsing live performances .
protests against frequent racist attacks against asians in britain in the early 90s formed much of adf ’ s lyrical content in the early years .
while adf struggled to find acceptance in britain at the time as asian artists , they rose to swift popularity particularly in france , where their second album r.a.f.i. was released in 1997 .
adf is on the road in germany to promote their latest album enemy of the enemy , a steaming mix of political and social statements spanning paranoia over asylum seekers in europe to the threat of terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asian dub foundation dr. das hours before their concert in berlin , founder member and bassist of adf , aniruddha das better known as dr. das spoke to dw-world about the band ’ s political views , the experience of being asian in britain , reconciling indian musical traditions with western music and their success in france .
anti-racist messages were the focus of your music in the early years .
how did that come about ?
that was a direct reaction to specific things that were going on in london at the time like the election of a fascist councilor in east london , the rise of the far-right bnp and how that allowed and encouraged racists to come out and attack people in broad daylight literally .
we were people making and teaching music , and so we formed a sound system with microphone and turntables .
for us a sound system is literally direct communication .
we were trying to do as musicians what we could do to talk about the situation and maybe encourage people to put up some kind of resistance .
is there ever a clash between the politically and socially loaded lyrics of your music and the music in itself ?
no , not all .
we don ’ t even analyze it like that .
for us it ’ s all expression , it ’ s about exposing what ’ s going on in our heads .
so whether it ’ s lyrically or musically , we make no distinction .
everything that comes out in the lyrics are things we happen to be talking about as people or concerns that we have as people .
when we started out we were talking about things that were more local , more specific to our experience directly .
now the issues are maybe the same , but it ’ s global .
we ’ ve already talked a lot in the first place about our experience of being " asian " of being the children of immigrants to britain and our experience in britain .
because we ’ ve traveled so much around the world , we ’ ve found that all kinds of people are finding something in our music something that is of relevance to their lives .
that surprised us , to get people from all kinds of musical and cultural backgrounds , that kind of made us think a bit more globally .
has your message changed over the years ?
what is " our " message anyway ?
you think our message is one thing , but we basically want people to be brave and question and to hopefully go out and do their own thing , whether it ’ s music or writing or art or whatever .
we ’ d just like to see more and more people being creative , making their own sound systems , creating their own parties , having exhibitions in their living room , whatever .
how do you think things changed since the sep.11 attacks and how has this affected your music ?
your latest album enemy of the enemy is a reference to the latest u.s.-led war on terror .
i think the world is exactly the same .
i think some people ’ s perception of it has maybe changed , but all the underlying principles of what ’ s going on is exactly the same .
the way cnn reports about what is going on in the world is completely different to what we ’ re getting , so the american population is completely oblivious to why people should want to attack them .
for us , calling our latest album enemy of the enemy is referring to things like that .
people like saddam hussein and osama bin laden were set up as the enemy of the enemy .
america supported saddam hussein , they gave him the chemical capabilities and the so-called weapons of mass destruction .
of course they -lrb- the americans -rrb- know there are weapons of mass destruction , they ’ ve got the receipts !
they set up saddam in the first place , trained him , trained his elite and the same goes for osama .
these are just two of the most obvious , underhand things that have been going on .
we ’ re just saying things aren ’ t as simple as they seem , this whole war on terrorism thing is completely bullshit because who ’ s trained and funded and supplied the terrorists in the first place for what reasons ?
the group public enemy in america , who you ’ ve often been compared to , is known as the cnn for the blacks .
do you see yourself as a kind of cnn for the asians ?
not really .
we do like the idea of alternative news broadcasts .
there is a role for artists and musicians to bring up issues and subject matter or things that the media does not wish to deal with or feel that they ’ re not allowed to deal with .
then you ’ ve got the whole internet thing , you can point people to all sources of information .
so in one respect people are beginning to ignore the media all together .
i know i am , this is the only time i don ’ t ignore the media , when i ’ m being interviewed by them !
we don ’ t mind being compared to the public enemy – they ’ re completely wicked , i just heard them again recently with a track called " son of a bush " .
they ’ re awesome , they started 20-25 years ago and they ’ re just up there doing some amazing innovative music , sonically just completely outrageous , they ’ ve live guitar bass and drums , turntables whatever .
how do you explain the present asian boom in europe ?
everything " asian " is dubbed " cool " .
ask your mates in the media .
it ’ s a media thing .
the same goes for us , i was making music for ten years before adf , five years of that in developing what became adf , you know the mixing of indian sounds and all of that with whatever else we were listening to .
we were just getting on with it all the time .
all this about asians being " cool " – that is so insulting , how can you call a whole group of people , a whole culture cool or uncool ?
i don ’ t relate to that at all .
as for the " asian underground " thing , i think talvin singh originally used that term for his first album or compilation and then it came to be associated with anybody who happened to be of asian origin creating music in britain .
whereas in terms of diversity , the stuff that everybody was doing was completely different .
they just all happen to be asian .
i think the only thing we have in common , which i ’ m very proud of , is asian musicians all embrace technology as well as having a foundation of very rich and old musical traditions to draw upon .
we got straight in there with the technology , the samplers , the sequences , drum machines whatever and had no problem with that whatsoever mixing rap with all the classical instruments , the acoustic stuff .

a european defense summit held by four nations that opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq begins in brussels on tuesday .
but france and germany , anxious to mend ties with the u.s. , are now playing down its importance . a defense summit in brussels on tuesday , originally meant to reinforce plans for an integrated european defense policy , has largely downsized its ambitions in the face of growing skepticism and criticism .
the mini-summit called by belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt will see leaders of germany , france and luxembourg , all strongly opposed to the u.s.-led war against iraq , meeting for a half-day of talks in brussels .
among other things they are expected to discuss controversial proposals by verhofstadt for a european military headquarters separate from nato , specific defense spending targets and placing all multinational forces in the eu under a central command .
summit originally planned to bolster european defense verhofstadt launched the idea for the defense summit at the start of the iraq war , at a time when the european union was split on the bush administration ’ s war plans .
the original aim was to beef up eu defense , thereby giving weight and unity to the region 's foreign policy , to avoid member states being dragged into " coalitions of the willing " created by the u.s. the summit participants also hoped to form a core group of like-minded states to push ahead with defense integration .
the belgian premier said that stronger european defense cooperation was the right lesson to be drawn from internal eu squabbling over the war .
though attempts were made later to open up the summit to other eu members , the exclusion initially in particular of britain , america ’ s closest ally in the war , was seen as a direct snub to europe ’ s most effective military power alongside france .
france and germany backpedal initial enthusiasm the swift victory of the u.s. and britain in iraq , has seen the original drive to bolster european defense among the nations that support the summit fading .
in particular france and germany , eager to repair strained ties with the u.s. and britain , have now turned into reluctant supporters of the event .
" the timing could not have been more unfortunate .
the french and the germans want as low a profile as possible .
the less we talk about it the better , " one eu diplomat told reuters .
french president chirac , who angered the u.s. when he said paris would use its veto to block any security council resolution allowing the use of force in iraq , is now desperate to get back into washington ’ s good books .
it is believed that chirac is now anxious to avoid a european defense policy independent of the u.s.-led nato military alliance .
" chirac wants this summit to be as unprovocative as possible , " an eu diplomat told the financial times .
" at the same time he wants to support the idea of a stronger european defense policy .
it may be a difficult balancing act . "
schröder under pressure likewise german chancellor schröder , who was a vocal opponent of the u.s.-led war in iraq and is now eager to repair frayed ties with washington , is playing down the significance of the summit .
schröder is also under pressure from the conservative opposition in germany , who have said that the summit will only further divisions in a europe already deeply split over iraq .
last week angela merkel , leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- renewed her party ’ s call to boycott the summit .
she reiterated that a new defense grouping could be used to decouple europe from nato and the transatlantic alliance with the united states .
" in my opinion it ’ s important , especially considering the limited defense budget that we have in germany , to strengthen nato and european security policy rather than just part of nato .
we shouldn ’ t forge new alliances , " merkel said .

greece , the current eu president , will not be attending , nor will javier solana , the eu ’ s foreign policy chief .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday implied he would quit if his party didn ’ t support plans to reform the welfare system and boost the economy , as the government lowered its official growth forecast for 2003 . in an attempt to impose discipline on left-wing members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , schröder said those opposed to his “ agenda 2010 ” package of social reforms were endangering his ability to govern . “ anyone who wants to vote for or push through anything else has to know that they are removing the foundation of my work and are forcing me to deal with the consequences , ” schröder told journalists before a meeting with spd leaders in berlin . the party leadership voted to back the government ’ s reform agenda at a special spd congress to be held on june 1 .
the reforms , which aim to cut unemployment benefits and make it easier for firms to hire and fire , have encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing spd hardliners .
four members of the spd leadership voted against the proposals at monday ’ s meeting . refusing to back down having staked his political future on the implementation of agenda 2010 , schröder refused to placate the left-wing hardliners : “ there is no reason to think about changes . ”
in an attempt to build more momentum for his reform proposals , schröder will hold the first of four regional spd conferences in bonn later on monday . germany ’ s economy has in recent years ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at around 11 percent . as if to highlight the urgency of undertaking the painful reforms , schröder ’ s government on monday also cut its official growth forecast for 2003 .
instead of its previous forecast of 1 percent , the economy ministry now expects europe ’ s largest economy to expand only 0.75 percent this year . the slower growth makes it more likely that germany will not meet the european union 's 3 percent budget deficit target in 2003 for the second year in a row . still seen as too high but the downward revision is still higher than more pessimistic forecasts from the international monetary fund , the oecd , european commission and germany 's six leading institutes , which expect the economy to expand between 0.3 and 0.5 percent in 2003 . “ this -lrb- government -rrb- forecast is irresponsible considering the actual economic developments and the continuing economic and finance policy mistakes , ” rudolf hickel , the director of the european economic institute in bremen , told the german news agency dpa . the official revision came as germany 's closely-watched ifo business climate index unexpectedly fell in april despite the end of the war in iraq which had been expected to boost sentiment .
the munich-based ifo economic institute said the index dropped to 86.6 from 88.1in march , as firms remained skeptical over the prospects for the coming months . in further gloomy news , credit insurer hermes said on monday there was likely to be record number of bankruptcies in germany this year .
the subsidiary of financial services giant allianz said it expected around 44,000 firms to declare insolvency in 2003 , the highest level in 12 years .

staff at whitworth art gallery in manchester uncovered the theft as they prepared to reopen at about 1200 bst on sunday .
the masterpieces - van gogh 's the fortification of paris with houses , picasso 's poverty and gauguin 's tahitian landscape - could have been stolen at any time after 2100 bst on saturday .
greater manchester police have described the raid as " well planned " .
they spent sunday combing the gallery for evidence .
officers said several other items had also been taken .
the gallery , on oxford road , south of the city centre , has been closed to the public .
picasso created poverty in 1903 its collection of 40,000 works of art is designated as of national significance by the government .
it includes 12 picassos and van gogh 's hayricks , as well as sculptures , drawings , prints , wallpapers , historic textiles , british watercolours , and modern and contemporary art .
dutchman vincent van gogh painted the fortification of paris with houses in 1878 , at the age of 25 , using pencil , chalk and watercolours .
between 1891 and 1893 , parisian paul gauguin , who was born in 1848 , created his dramatic tahitian landscape with pencils and watercolours .

if that was the case , he warned the publication of the robbery by officers leading the inquiry could prompt those behind the theft to burn the evidence .
the gallery , which has been part of the university of manchester since 1958 , regularly changes exhibits and gives access to reserve collections .
gauguin used pencils and watercolours on tahitian landscape founded at grove house in 1889 , it is named after sir joseph whitworth , a stockport-born engineer who left it money .
