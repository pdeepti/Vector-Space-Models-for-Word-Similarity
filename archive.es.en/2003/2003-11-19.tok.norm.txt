program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2003 row over prestige oil spill continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige dumped some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic .
one year after the oil tanker prestige sank off the coast of spain spilling thousands of tons of oil onto europe 's coastline , the dispute over responsibility goes on . on november 19 , 2002 , the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker , finally broke in half and sank after drifting for six days off spain ’ s northwestern galician coast in rough weather .
the tanker ’ s slow and painful demise released some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic , causing one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit europe . the international clean-up effort lasted over two months , but large swathes of spanish and french coastline were affected by the spill . the region ’ s seabirds , fish stocks , marine mammals and coastal plant life were all decimated by the disaster . a year after the prestige disaster , controversy and anger still surround the break-up of the tanker , as environmental pressure groups and politicians continue to call for action and compensation . french report blames spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beaches were polluted .
at the heart of the controversy is an on-going row between france and spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2003 row over prestige oil spill continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige dumped some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic .
one year after the oil tanker prestige sank off the coast of spain spilling thousands of tons of oil onto europe 's coastline , the dispute over responsibility goes on . on november 19 , 2002 , the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker , finally broke in half and sank after drifting for six days off spain ’ s northwestern galician coast in rough weather .
the tanker ’ s slow and painful demise released some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic , causing one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit europe . the international clean-up effort lasted over two months , but large swathes of spanish and french coastline were affected by the spill . the region ’ s seabirds , fish stocks , marine mammals and coastal plant life were all decimated by the disaster . a year after the prestige disaster , controversy and anger still surround the break-up of the tanker , as environmental pressure groups and politicians continue to call for action and compensation . french report blames spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beaches were polluted .
at the heart of the controversy is an on-going row between france and spain .
the argument over who ’ s to blame erupted while the stricken tanker was still lurching precariously in the sea but gathered momentum when the ship sank and its slick reached southern france . the dispute has now escalated further due to a recently published judicial report commissioned by french parliamentarian philippe de villiers the vendee region which was affected by the spill . highly critical of the spanish government , the report claims that madrid ’ s actions made matters worse by preventing emergency crews from boarding the tanker until they had agreed to tow it out to sea . " good sense should have told them to bring it into the port of la coruna " to prevent the oil spreading so far , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead , the prestige broke up 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the spanish coast and eventually polluted more than a thousand beaches from france to portugal .
de villiers said he would begin legal action against the spanish government in view of the enormity of spain ’ s liability revealed by the report . calls for more eu involvement french president jacques chirac called on europe to do more to protect its coastlines from devastating oil spills similar to the prestige disaster .
the eu last month adopted rules banning single-hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil from eu ports .
however , despite the new legislation , nothing can in principle prevent an old tanker passing through the english channel between britain and france , as long as it does not dock . the eu will press for the single-hull ban to be implemented worldwide when members of the international maritime organisation -lrb- imo -rrb- meet in london in december .
the european union hopes that the imo will adopt the ban , but doubts remain as to whether sanctions would be as stringently enforced outside the eu and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are also calling for more to be done to prevent another disaster on the scale of the prestige .
greenpeace warned on the first anniversary of the storm that sealed the prestige ’ s fate that something similar could easily happen again unless tankers are subject to tougher rules and penalties . lack of protection the environmental group announced in a statement on november 13 that shipping companies would only tighten security sufficiently if they were obliged to pay for all the damages caused by the oil slicks themselves . " a year on , the sea is still without protection , " lopes de uralde , director of greenpeace spain , told a madrid press conference , ahead of the first anniversary of the tanker ’ s sinking .
" after the prestige , no legal measure has been adopted which would guarantee that a similar catastrophe does not happen again on europe ’ s coasts . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another group , friends of the earth , warned that victims of the prestige disaster - in particular those fishing companies which saw their stocks depleted by the ensuing pollution - may never receive full compensation , as the international body for oil pollution compensation has n't the funds to pay their claims . the executive committee of the london-based international oil pollution compensation fund decided in may 2003 to limit payments in respect to the prestige to 15 percent of their value , because claims are likely to exceed the amount of compensation available . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to ban " rustbucket " oil tankers european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year .

" it really hurts , " michael rogowski , head of the bdi , told reporters after the dollar-euro currency rate closed in on $ 1.20 wednesday .
" the pain threshold has been passed . "
as the euro continues to climb on the back of the latest trade rows , fears are also increasing over the damage it could do to germany 's export-led economy , since a strong currency makes german goods more expensive abroad . " we are also concerned that the end is not yet in sight , " rogowski told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2003 row over prestige oil spill continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige dumped some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic .
one year after the oil tanker prestige sank off the coast of spain spilling thousands of tons of oil onto europe 's coastline , the dispute over responsibility goes on . on november 19 , 2002 , the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker , finally broke in half and sank after drifting for six days off spain ’ s northwestern galician coast in rough weather .
the tanker ’ s slow and painful demise released some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic , causing one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit europe . the international clean-up effort lasted over two months , but large swathes of spanish and french coastline were affected by the spill . the region ’ s seabirds , fish stocks , marine mammals and coastal plant life were all decimated by the disaster . a year after the prestige disaster , controversy and anger still surround the break-up of the tanker , as environmental pressure groups and politicians continue to call for action and compensation . french report blames spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beaches were polluted .
at the heart of the controversy is an on-going row between france and spain .
the argument over who ’ s to blame erupted while the stricken tanker was still lurching precariously in the sea but gathered momentum when the ship sank and its slick reached southern france . the dispute has now escalated further due to a recently published judicial report commissioned by french parliamentarian philippe de villiers the vendee region which was affected by the spill . highly critical of the spanish government , the report claims that madrid ’ s actions made matters worse by preventing emergency crews from boarding the tanker until they had agreed to tow it out to sea . " good sense should have told them to bring it into the port of la coruna " to prevent the oil spreading so far , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead , the prestige broke up 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the spanish coast and eventually polluted more than a thousand beaches from france to portugal .
de villiers said he would begin legal action against the spanish government in view of the enormity of spain ’ s liability revealed by the report . calls for more eu involvement french president jacques chirac called on europe to do more to protect its coastlines from devastating oil spills similar to the prestige disaster .
the eu last month adopted rules banning single-hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil from eu ports .
however , despite the new legislation , nothing can in principle prevent an old tanker passing through the english channel between britain and france , as long as it does not dock . the eu will press for the single-hull ban to be implemented worldwide when members of the international maritime organisation -lrb- imo -rrb- meet in london in december .
the european union hopes that the imo will adopt the ban , but doubts remain as to whether sanctions would be as stringently enforced outside the eu and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are also calling for more to be done to prevent another disaster on the scale of the prestige .
greenpeace warned on the first anniversary of the storm that sealed the prestige ’ s fate that something similar could easily happen again unless tankers are subject to tougher rules and penalties . lack of protection the environmental group announced in a statement on november 13 that shipping companies would only tighten security sufficiently if they were obliged to pay for all the damages caused by the oil slicks themselves . " a year on , the sea is still without protection , " lopes de uralde , director of greenpeace spain , told a madrid press conference , ahead of the first anniversary of the tanker ’ s sinking .
" after the prestige , no legal measure has been adopted which would guarantee that a similar catastrophe does not happen again on europe ’ s coasts . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another group , friends of the earth , warned that victims of the prestige disaster - in particular those fishing companies which saw their stocks depleted by the ensuing pollution - may never receive full compensation , as the international body for oil pollution compensation has n't the funds to pay their claims . the executive committee of the london-based international oil pollution compensation fund decided in may 2003 to limit payments in respect to the prestige to 15 percent of their value , because claims are likely to exceed the amount of compensation available . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to ban " rustbucket " oil tankers european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year .

one year after the oil tanker prestige sank off the coast of spain spilling thousands of tons of oil onto europe 's coastline , the dispute over responsibility goes on . on november 19 , 2002 , the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker , finally broke in half and sank after drifting for six days off spain ’ s northwestern galician coast in rough weather .
the tanker ’ s slow and painful demise released some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic , causing one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit europe . the international clean-up effort lasted over two months , but large swathes of spanish and french coastline were affected by the spill . the region ’ s seabirds , fish stocks , marine mammals and coastal plant life were all decimated by the disaster . a year after the prestige disaster , controversy and anger still surround the break-up of the tanker , as environmental pressure groups and politicians continue to call for action and compensation . french report blames spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beaches were polluted .
at the heart of the controversy is an on-going row between france and spain .
the argument over who ’ s to blame erupted while the stricken tanker was still lurching precariously in the sea but gathered momentum when the ship sank and its slick reached southern france . the dispute has now escalated further due to a recently published judicial report commissioned by french parliamentarian philippe de villiers the vendee region which was affected by the spill . highly critical of the spanish government , the report claims that madrid ’ s actions made matters worse by preventing emergency crews from boarding the tanker until they had agreed to tow it out to sea . " good sense should have told them to bring it into the port of la coruna " to prevent the oil spreading so far , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead , the prestige broke up 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the spanish coast and eventually polluted more than a thousand beaches from france to portugal .
de villiers said he would begin legal action against the spanish government in view of the enormity of spain ’ s liability revealed by the report . calls for more eu involvement french president jacques chirac called on europe to do more to protect its coastlines from devastating oil spills similar to the prestige disaster .
the eu last month adopted rules banning single-hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil from eu ports .
however , despite the new legislation , nothing can in principle prevent an old tanker passing through the english channel between britain and france , as long as it does not dock . the eu will press for the single-hull ban to be implemented worldwide when members of the international maritime organisation -lrb- imo -rrb- meet in london in december .
the european union hopes that the imo will adopt the ban , but doubts remain as to whether sanctions would be as stringently enforced outside the eu and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are also calling for more to be done to prevent another disaster on the scale of the prestige .
greenpeace warned on the first anniversary of the storm that sealed the prestige ’ s fate that something similar could easily happen again unless tankers are subject to tougher rules and penalties . lack of protection the environmental group announced in a statement on november 13 that shipping companies would only tighten security sufficiently if they were obliged to pay for all the damages caused by the oil slicks themselves . " a year on , the sea is still without protection , " lopes de uralde , director of greenpeace spain , told a madrid press conference , ahead of the first anniversary of the tanker ’ s sinking .
" after the prestige , no legal measure has been adopted which would guarantee that a similar catastrophe does not happen again on europe ’ s coasts . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another group , friends of the earth , warned that victims of the prestige disaster - in particular those fishing companies which saw their stocks depleted by the ensuing pollution - may never receive full compensation , as the international body for oil pollution compensation has n't the funds to pay their claims . the executive committee of the london-based international oil pollution compensation fund decided in may 2003 to limit payments in respect to the prestige to 15 percent of their value , because claims are likely to exceed the amount of compensation available . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to ban " rustbucket " oil tankers european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year .

one year after the oil tanker prestige sank off the coast of spain spilling thousands of tons of oil onto europe 's coastline , the dispute over responsibility goes on . on november 19 , 2002 , the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker , finally broke in half and sank after drifting for six days off spain ’ s northwestern galician coast in rough weather .
the tanker ’ s slow and painful demise released some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic , causing one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit europe . the international clean-up effort lasted over two months , but large swathes of spanish and french coastline were affected by the spill . the region ’ s seabirds , fish stocks , marine mammals and coastal plant life were all decimated by the disaster . a year after the prestige disaster , controversy and anger still surround the break-up of the tanker , as environmental pressure groups and politicians continue to call for action and compensation . french report blames spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beaches were polluted .
at the heart of the controversy is an on-going row between france and spain .
the argument over who ’ s to blame erupted while the stricken tanker was still lurching precariously in the sea but gathered momentum when the ship sank and its slick reached southern france . the dispute has now escalated further due to a recently published judicial report commissioned by french parliamentarian philippe de villiers the vendee region which was affected by the spill . highly critical of the spanish government , the report claims that madrid ’ s actions made matters worse by preventing emergency crews from boarding the tanker until they had agreed to tow it out to sea . " good sense should have told them to bring it into the port of la coruna " to prevent the oil spreading so far , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead , the prestige broke up 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the spanish coast and eventually polluted more than a thousand beaches from france to portugal .
de villiers said he would begin legal action against the spanish government in view of the enormity of spain ’ s liability revealed by the report . calls for more eu involvement french president jacques chirac called on europe to do more to protect its coastlines from devastating oil spills similar to the prestige disaster .
the eu last month adopted rules banning single-hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil from eu ports .
however , despite the new legislation , nothing can in principle prevent an old tanker passing through the english channel between britain and france , as long as it does not dock . the eu will press for the single-hull ban to be implemented worldwide when members of the international maritime organisation -lrb- imo -rrb- meet in london in december .
the european union hopes that the imo will adopt the ban , but doubts remain as to whether sanctions would be as stringently enforced outside the eu and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are also calling for more to be done to prevent another disaster on the scale of the prestige .
greenpeace warned on the first anniversary of the storm that sealed the prestige ’ s fate that something similar could easily happen again unless tankers are subject to tougher rules and penalties . lack of protection the environmental group announced in a statement on november 13 that shipping companies would only tighten security sufficiently if they were obliged to pay for all the damages caused by the oil slicks themselves . " a year on , the sea is still without protection , " lopes de uralde , director of greenpeace spain , told a madrid press conference , ahead of the first anniversary of the tanker ’ s sinking .
" after the prestige , no legal measure has been adopted which would guarantee that a similar catastrophe does not happen again on europe ’ s coasts . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another group , friends of the earth , warned that victims of the prestige disaster - in particular those fishing companies which saw their stocks depleted by the ensuing pollution - may never receive full compensation , as the international body for oil pollution compensation has n't the funds to pay their claims . the executive committee of the london-based international oil pollution compensation fund decided in may 2003 to limit payments in respect to the prestige to 15 percent of their value , because claims are likely to exceed the amount of compensation available . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to ban " rustbucket " oil tankers european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year .

it also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
a spokesman for eichel reiterated that germany has already worked with the commission to reduce the deficit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2003 row over prestige oil spill continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige dumped some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic .
one year after the oil tanker prestige sank off the coast of spain spilling thousands of tons of oil onto europe 's coastline , the dispute over responsibility goes on . on november 19 , 2002 , the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker , finally broke in half and sank after drifting for six days off spain ’ s northwestern galician coast in rough weather .
the tanker ’ s slow and painful demise released some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic , causing one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit europe . the international clean-up effort lasted over two months , but large swathes of spanish and french coastline were affected by the spill . the region ’ s seabirds , fish stocks , marine mammals and coastal plant life were all decimated by the disaster . a year after the prestige disaster , controversy and anger still surround the break-up of the tanker , as environmental pressure groups and politicians continue to call for action and compensation . french report blames spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beaches were polluted .
at the heart of the controversy is an on-going row between france and spain .
the argument over who ’ s to blame erupted while the stricken tanker was still lurching precariously in the sea but gathered momentum when the ship sank and its slick reached southern france . the dispute has now escalated further due to a recently published judicial report commissioned by french parliamentarian philippe de villiers the vendee region which was affected by the spill . highly critical of the spanish government , the report claims that madrid ’ s actions made matters worse by preventing emergency crews from boarding the tanker until they had agreed to tow it out to sea . " good sense should have told them to bring it into the port of la coruna " to prevent the oil spreading so far , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead , the prestige broke up 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the spanish coast and eventually polluted more than a thousand beaches from france to portugal .
de villiers said he would begin legal action against the spanish government in view of the enormity of spain ’ s liability revealed by the report . calls for more eu involvement french president jacques chirac called on europe to do more to protect its coastlines from devastating oil spills similar to the prestige disaster .
the eu last month adopted rules banning single-hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil from eu ports .
however , despite the new legislation , nothing can in principle prevent an old tanker passing through the english channel between britain and france , as long as it does not dock . the eu will press for the single-hull ban to be implemented worldwide when members of the international maritime organisation -lrb- imo -rrb- meet in london in december .
the european union hopes that the imo will adopt the ban , but doubts remain as to whether sanctions would be as stringently enforced outside the eu and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are also calling for more to be done to prevent another disaster on the scale of the prestige .
greenpeace warned on the first anniversary of the storm that sealed the prestige ’ s fate that something similar could easily happen again unless tankers are subject to tougher rules and penalties . lack of protection the environmental group announced in a statement on november 13 that shipping companies would only tighten security sufficiently if they were obliged to pay for all the damages caused by the oil slicks themselves . " a year on , the sea is still without protection , " lopes de uralde , director of greenpeace spain , told a madrid press conference , ahead of the first anniversary of the tanker ’ s sinking .
" after the prestige , no legal measure has been adopted which would guarantee that a similar catastrophe does not happen again on europe ’ s coasts . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another group , friends of the earth , warned that victims of the prestige disaster - in particular those fishing companies which saw their stocks depleted by the ensuing pollution - may never receive full compensation , as the international body for oil pollution compensation has n't the funds to pay their claims . the executive committee of the london-based international oil pollution compensation fund decided in may 2003 to limit payments in respect to the prestige to 15 percent of their value , because claims are likely to exceed the amount of compensation available . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to ban " rustbucket " oil tankers european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year .

one year after the oil tanker prestige sank off the coast of spain spilling thousands of tons of oil onto europe 's coastline , the dispute over responsibility goes on . on november 19 , 2002 , the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker , finally broke in half and sank after drifting for six days off spain ’ s northwestern galician coast in rough weather .
the tanker ’ s slow and painful demise released some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic , causing one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit europe . the international clean-up effort lasted over two months , but large swathes of spanish and french coastline were affected by the spill . the region ’ s seabirds , fish stocks , marine mammals and coastal plant life were all decimated by the disaster . a year after the prestige disaster , controversy and anger still surround the break-up of the tanker , as environmental pressure groups and politicians continue to call for action and compensation . french report blames spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beaches were polluted .
at the heart of the controversy is an on-going row between france and spain .
the argument over who ’ s to blame erupted while the stricken tanker was still lurching precariously in the sea but gathered momentum when the ship sank and its slick reached southern france . the dispute has now escalated further due to a recently published judicial report commissioned by french parliamentarian philippe de villiers the vendee region which was affected by the spill . highly critical of the spanish government , the report claims that madrid ’ s actions made matters worse by preventing emergency crews from boarding the tanker until they had agreed to tow it out to sea . " good sense should have told them to bring it into the port of la coruna " to prevent the oil spreading so far , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead , the prestige broke up 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the spanish coast and eventually polluted more than a thousand beaches from france to portugal .
de villiers said he would begin legal action against the spanish government in view of the enormity of spain ’ s liability revealed by the report . calls for more eu involvement french president jacques chirac called on europe to do more to protect its coastlines from devastating oil spills similar to the prestige disaster .
the eu last month adopted rules banning single-hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil from eu ports .
however , despite the new legislation , nothing can in principle prevent an old tanker passing through the english channel between britain and france , as long as it does not dock . the eu will press for the single-hull ban to be implemented worldwide when members of the international maritime organisation -lrb- imo -rrb- meet in london in december .
the european union hopes that the imo will adopt the ban , but doubts remain as to whether sanctions would be as stringently enforced outside the eu and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are also calling for more to be done to prevent another disaster on the scale of the prestige .
greenpeace warned on the first anniversary of the storm that sealed the prestige ’ s fate that something similar could easily happen again unless tankers are subject to tougher rules and penalties . lack of protection the environmental group announced in a statement on november 13 that shipping companies would only tighten security sufficiently if they were obliged to pay for all the damages caused by the oil slicks themselves . " a year on , the sea is still without protection , " lopes de uralde , director of greenpeace spain , told a madrid press conference , ahead of the first anniversary of the tanker ’ s sinking .
" after the prestige , no legal measure has been adopted which would guarantee that a similar catastrophe does not happen again on europe ’ s coasts . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another group , friends of the earth , warned that victims of the prestige disaster - in particular those fishing companies which saw their stocks depleted by the ensuing pollution - may never receive full compensation , as the international body for oil pollution compensation has n't the funds to pay their claims . the executive committee of the london-based international oil pollution compensation fund decided in may 2003 to limit payments in respect to the prestige to 15 percent of their value , because claims are likely to exceed the amount of compensation available . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to ban " rustbucket " oil tankers european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year .

the tanker ’ s slow and painful demise released some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic , causing one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit europe . the international clean-up effort lasted over two months , but large swathes of spanish and french coastline were affected by the spill . the region ’ s seabirds , fish stocks , marine mammals and coastal plant life were all decimated by the disaster . a year after the prestige disaster , controversy and anger still surround the break-up of the tanker , as environmental pressure groups and politicians continue to call for action and compensation . french report blames spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beaches were polluted .
at the heart of the controversy is an on-going row between france and spain .
the argument over who ’ s to blame erupted while the stricken tanker was still lurching precariously in the sea but gathered momentum when the ship sank and its slick reached southern france . the dispute has now escalated further due to a recently published judicial report commissioned by french parliamentarian philippe de villiers the vendee region which was affected by the spill . highly critical of the spanish government , the report claims that madrid ’ s actions made matters worse by preventing emergency crews from boarding the tanker until they had agreed to tow it out to sea . " good sense should have told them to bring it into the port of la coruna " to prevent the oil spreading so far , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead , the prestige broke up 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the spanish coast and eventually polluted more than a thousand beaches from france to portugal .
de villiers said he would begin legal action against the spanish government in view of the enormity of spain ’ s liability revealed by the report . calls for more eu involvement french president jacques chirac called on europe to do more to protect its coastlines from devastating oil spills similar to the prestige disaster .
the eu last month adopted rules banning single-hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil from eu ports .
however , despite the new legislation , nothing can in principle prevent an old tanker passing through the english channel between britain and france , as long as it does not dock . the eu will press for the single-hull ban to be implemented worldwide when members of the international maritime organisation -lrb- imo -rrb- meet in london in december .
the european union hopes that the imo will adopt the ban , but doubts remain as to whether sanctions would be as stringently enforced outside the eu and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are also calling for more to be done to prevent another disaster on the scale of the prestige .
greenpeace warned on the first anniversary of the storm that sealed the prestige ’ s fate that something similar could easily happen again unless tankers are subject to tougher rules and penalties . lack of protection the environmental group announced in a statement on november 13 that shipping companies would only tighten security sufficiently if they were obliged to pay for all the damages caused by the oil slicks themselves . " a year on , the sea is still without protection , " lopes de uralde , director of greenpeace spain , told a madrid press conference , ahead of the first anniversary of the tanker ’ s sinking .
" after the prestige , no legal measure has been adopted which would guarantee that a similar catastrophe does not happen again on europe ’ s coasts . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another group , friends of the earth , warned that victims of the prestige disaster - in particular those fishing companies which saw their stocks depleted by the ensuing pollution - may never receive full compensation , as the international body for oil pollution compensation has n't the funds to pay their claims . the executive committee of the london-based international oil pollution compensation fund decided in may 2003 to limit payments in respect to the prestige to 15 percent of their value , because claims are likely to exceed the amount of compensation available . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to ban " rustbucket " oil tankers european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year .

the argument over who ’ s to blame erupted while the stricken tanker was still lurching precariously in the sea but gathered momentum when the ship sank and its slick reached southern france . the dispute has now escalated further due to a recently published judicial report commissioned by french parliamentarian philippe de villiers the vendee region which was affected by the spill . highly critical of the spanish government , the report claims that madrid ’ s actions made matters worse by preventing emergency crews from boarding the tanker until they had agreed to tow it out to sea . " good sense should have told them to bring it into the port of la coruna " to prevent the oil spreading so far , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead , the prestige broke up 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the spanish coast and eventually polluted more than a thousand beaches from france to portugal .
de villiers said he would begin legal action against the spanish government in view of the enormity of spain ’ s liability revealed by the report . calls for more eu involvement french president jacques chirac called on europe to do more to protect its coastlines from devastating oil spills similar to the prestige disaster .
the eu last month adopted rules banning single-hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil from eu ports .
however , despite the new legislation , nothing can in principle prevent an old tanker passing through the english channel between britain and france , as long as it does not dock . the eu will press for the single-hull ban to be implemented worldwide when members of the international maritime organisation -lrb- imo -rrb- meet in london in december .
the european union hopes that the imo will adopt the ban , but doubts remain as to whether sanctions would be as stringently enforced outside the eu and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are also calling for more to be done to prevent another disaster on the scale of the prestige .
greenpeace warned on the first anniversary of the storm that sealed the prestige ’ s fate that something similar could easily happen again unless tankers are subject to tougher rules and penalties . lack of protection the environmental group announced in a statement on november 13 that shipping companies would only tighten security sufficiently if they were obliged to pay for all the damages caused by the oil slicks themselves . " a year on , the sea is still without protection , " lopes de uralde , director of greenpeace spain , told a madrid press conference , ahead of the first anniversary of the tanker ’ s sinking .
" after the prestige , no legal measure has been adopted which would guarantee that a similar catastrophe does not happen again on europe ’ s coasts . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another group , friends of the earth , warned that victims of the prestige disaster - in particular those fishing companies which saw their stocks depleted by the ensuing pollution - may never receive full compensation , as the international body for oil pollution compensation has n't the funds to pay their claims . the executive committee of the london-based international oil pollution compensation fund decided in may 2003 to limit payments in respect to the prestige to 15 percent of their value , because claims are likely to exceed the amount of compensation available . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to ban " rustbucket " oil tankers european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.11.2003 -pipe- 16:00 utc taxes on stock gains possible the german government is considering taxing all stock gains , according to the german business daily handelsblatt .
according to the report , not only interest and dividends , but also stock gains would be taxable at 25 percent by 2005 .
so far , the latter do n't get taxed if more than a year has passed between buying and selling shares .
if they 're sold earlier , shareholders have to pay taxes on half of the gains .

" the pain threshold has been passed . "
as the euro continues to climb on the back of the latest trade rows , fears are also increasing over the damage it could do to germany 's export-led economy , since a strong currency makes german goods more expensive abroad .

trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .
some fear the euro 's strength could begin to hurt germany 's stock market and its nascent economic recovery . the head of germany 's main industry association said the euro 's new high meant the german companies were already having trouble coping .
" it really hurts , " michael rogowski , head of the bdi , told reporters after the dollar-euro currency rate closed in on $ 1.20 wednesday .
" the pain threshold has been passed . "
as the euro continues to climb on the back of the latest trade rows , fears are also increasing over the damage it could do to germany 's export-led economy , since a strong currency makes german goods more expensive abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2003 row over prestige oil spill continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige dumped some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic .
one year after the oil tanker prestige sank off the coast of spain spilling thousands of tons of oil onto europe 's coastline , the dispute over responsibility goes on . on november 19 , 2002 , the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker , finally broke in half and sank after drifting for six days off spain ’ s northwestern galician coast in rough weather .
the tanker ’ s slow and painful demise released some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic , causing one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit europe . the international clean-up effort lasted over two months , but large swathes of spanish and french coastline were affected by the spill . the region ’ s seabirds , fish stocks , marine mammals and coastal plant life were all decimated by the disaster . a year after the prestige disaster , controversy and anger still surround the break-up of the tanker , as environmental pressure groups and politicians continue to call for action and compensation . french report blames spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beaches were polluted .
at the heart of the controversy is an on-going row between france and spain .
the argument over who ’ s to blame erupted while the stricken tanker was still lurching precariously in the sea but gathered momentum when the ship sank and its slick reached southern france . the dispute has now escalated further due to a recently published judicial report commissioned by french parliamentarian philippe de villiers the vendee region which was affected by the spill . highly critical of the spanish government , the report claims that madrid ’ s actions made matters worse by preventing emergency crews from boarding the tanker until they had agreed to tow it out to sea . " good sense should have told them to bring it into the port of la coruna " to prevent the oil spreading so far , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead , the prestige broke up 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the spanish coast and eventually polluted more than a thousand beaches from france to portugal .
de villiers said he would begin legal action against the spanish government in view of the enormity of spain ’ s liability revealed by the report . calls for more eu involvement french president jacques chirac called on europe to do more to protect its coastlines from devastating oil spills similar to the prestige disaster .
the eu last month adopted rules banning single-hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil from eu ports .
however , despite the new legislation , nothing can in principle prevent an old tanker passing through the english channel between britain and france , as long as it does not dock . the eu will press for the single-hull ban to be implemented worldwide when members of the international maritime organisation -lrb- imo -rrb- meet in london in december .
the european union hopes that the imo will adopt the ban , but doubts remain as to whether sanctions would be as stringently enforced outside the eu and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are also calling for more to be done to prevent another disaster on the scale of the prestige .
greenpeace warned on the first anniversary of the storm that sealed the prestige ’ s fate that something similar could easily happen again unless tankers are subject to tougher rules and penalties . lack of protection the environmental group announced in a statement on november 13 that shipping companies would only tighten security sufficiently if they were obliged to pay for all the damages caused by the oil slicks themselves . " a year on , the sea is still without protection , " lopes de uralde , director of greenpeace spain , told a madrid press conference , ahead of the first anniversary of the tanker ’ s sinking .
" after the prestige , no legal measure has been adopted which would guarantee that a similar catastrophe does not happen again on europe ’ s coasts . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another group , friends of the earth , warned that victims of the prestige disaster - in particular those fishing companies which saw their stocks depleted by the ensuing pollution - may never receive full compensation , as the international body for oil pollution compensation has n't the funds to pay their claims . the executive committee of the london-based international oil pollution compensation fund decided in may 2003 to limit payments in respect to the prestige to 15 percent of their value , because claims are likely to exceed the amount of compensation available . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to ban " rustbucket " oil tankers european union transport ministers endorsed a ban on thursday on old single hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil , in an attempt to prevent oil slicks like the one caused by the prestige disaster last year .

one year after the oil tanker prestige sank off the coast of spain spilling thousands of tons of oil onto europe 's coastline , the dispute over responsibility goes on . on november 19 , 2002 , the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker , finally broke in half and sank after drifting for six days off spain ’ s northwestern galician coast in rough weather .
the tanker ’ s slow and painful demise released some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic , causing one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit europe . the international clean-up effort lasted over two months , but large swathes of spanish and french coastline were affected by the spill . the region ’ s seabirds , fish stocks , marine mammals and coastal plant life were all decimated by the disaster . a year after the prestige disaster , controversy and anger still surround the break-up of the tanker , as environmental pressure groups and politicians continue to call for action and compensation . french report blames spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beaches were polluted .
at the heart of the controversy is an on-going row between france and spain .
the argument over who ’ s to blame erupted while the stricken tanker was still lurching precariously in the sea but gathered momentum when the ship sank and its slick reached southern france . the dispute has now escalated further due to a recently published judicial report commissioned by french parliamentarian philippe de villiers the vendee region which was affected by the spill . highly critical of the spanish government , the report claims that madrid ’ s actions made matters worse by preventing emergency crews from boarding the tanker until they had agreed to tow it out to sea . " good sense should have told them to bring it into the port of la coruna " to prevent the oil spreading so far , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead , the prestige broke up 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the spanish coast and eventually polluted more than a thousand beaches from france to portugal .
de villiers said he would begin legal action against the spanish government in view of the enormity of spain ’ s liability revealed by the report . calls for more eu involvement french president jacques chirac called on europe to do more to protect its coastlines from devastating oil spills similar to the prestige disaster .
the eu last month adopted rules banning single-hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil from eu ports .
however , despite the new legislation , nothing can in principle prevent an old tanker passing through the english channel between britain and france , as long as it does not dock . the eu will press for the single-hull ban to be implemented worldwide when members of the international maritime organisation -lrb- imo -rrb- meet in london in december .
the european union hopes that the imo will adopt the ban , but doubts remain as to whether sanctions would be as stringently enforced outside the eu and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are also calling for more to be done to prevent another disaster on the scale of the prestige .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.11.2003 row over prestige oil spill continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prestige dumped some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic .
one year after the oil tanker prestige sank off the coast of spain spilling thousands of tons of oil onto europe 's coastline , the dispute over responsibility goes on . on november 19 , 2002 , the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker , finally broke in half and sank after drifting for six days off spain ’ s northwestern galician coast in rough weather .
the tanker ’ s slow and painful demise released some 50,000 tons of oil into the atlantic , causing one of the worst environmental disasters ever to hit europe . the international clean-up effort lasted over two months , but large swathes of spanish and french coastline were affected by the spill . the region ’ s seabirds , fish stocks , marine mammals and coastal plant life were all decimated by the disaster . a year after the prestige disaster , controversy and anger still surround the break-up of the tanker , as environmental pressure groups and politicians continue to call for action and compensation . french report blames spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of beaches were polluted .
at the heart of the controversy is an on-going row between france and spain .
the argument over who ’ s to blame erupted while the stricken tanker was still lurching precariously in the sea but gathered momentum when the ship sank and its slick reached southern france . the dispute has now escalated further due to a recently published judicial report commissioned by french parliamentarian philippe de villiers the vendee region which was affected by the spill . highly critical of the spanish government , the report claims that madrid ’ s actions made matters worse by preventing emergency crews from boarding the tanker until they had agreed to tow it out to sea . " good sense should have told them to bring it into the port of la coruna " to prevent the oil spreading so far , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead , the prestige broke up 210 kilometers -lrb- 130 miles -rrb- off the spanish coast and eventually polluted more than a thousand beaches from france to portugal .
de villiers said he would begin legal action against the spanish government in view of the enormity of spain ’ s liability revealed by the report . calls for more eu involvement french president jacques chirac called on europe to do more to protect its coastlines from devastating oil spills similar to the prestige disaster .
the eu last month adopted rules banning single-hull tankers carrying heavy fuel oil from eu ports .
however , despite the new legislation , nothing can in principle prevent an old tanker passing through the english channel between britain and france , as long as it does not dock . the eu will press for the single-hull ban to be implemented worldwide when members of the international maritime organisation -lrb- imo -rrb- meet in london in december .
the european union hopes that the imo will adopt the ban , but doubts remain as to whether sanctions would be as stringently enforced outside the eu and the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are also calling for more to be done to prevent another disaster on the scale of the prestige .
greenpeace warned on the first anniversary of the storm that sealed the prestige ’ s fate that something similar could easily happen again unless tankers are subject to tougher rules and penalties . lack of protection the environmental group announced in a statement on november 13 that shipping companies would only tighten security sufficiently if they were obliged to pay for all the damages caused by the oil slicks themselves . " a year on , the sea is still without protection , " lopes de uralde , director of greenpeace spain , told a madrid press conference , ahead of the first anniversary of the tanker ’ s sinking .
" after the prestige , no legal measure has been adopted which would guarantee that a similar catastrophe does not happen again on europe ’ s coasts .

the commerce department said it planned to set quotas limiting growth in chinese textile imports to 7.5 % a year .
the move follows a sharp increase in shipments of chinese clothing products over the past 14 months .
us commerce undersecretary grant aldonas said the surge in imports had been helped by government subsidies .
" it 's not just a question of a dramatic surge , but a heavily state-owned industry that 's subsidised by state-owned banks , " he said .
dollar slides the financial markets reacted nervously , with the euro rising to an all-time high of $ 1.19 amid fears that the tentative us economic recovery may be derailed by a return to protectionist trade policies .

her lawyers wanted to strike out the two most serious charges , obstruction of justice and securities fraud .
they claimed that she was using her right to free speech when she denied insider dealing , rather than trying to prop up shares in her company .
but the judge said that right did not apply to " false factual statements " .
the scandal surrounding martha stewart - an icon of us media and retail , and the face of a homecare empire - began when a friend 's biotechnology company warned investors in 2001 that regulators had rejected a drug application .
shares in the firm , imclone , plummeted .
but soon afterwards it emerged that ms stewart had sold shares worth about $ 230,000 the day before the announcement , sparking allegations that she might have been told about the announcement ahead of time .
trading on private information leaked selectively by a public company is insider dealing , an offence for which imclone 's founder , sam waksal , is currently serving a seven-year jail term .
charges the securities fraud and obstruction of justice charges relate to ms stewart 's protestations of innocence following the publication of the allegations .
her pleas , the defence argued , were simply a matter of self-protection .
but prosecutors say they were designed to shore up shares in her firm , martha stewart living omnipedia .
using securities fraud charges - which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years - to tackle that kind of comment was " novel " , district judge miriam cedarbaum conceded .
but she said the judgement should rest with a jury , not with her .

hundreds of people displaced by ethnic violence are now expected to return home .
it is almost four months since a multi-national intervention force landed in the struggling south pacific nation , which had endured years of bloodshed , corruption and economic decline .

he said that 2,000 jobs had been created in the area since the scheme began in 2001 and the target by 2011 was for 10 times that number .
a number of companies such as esure , morgan stanley and jp morgan had already been attracted to the area , he said .

kevin jackson , from hadfield , greater manchester , had transferred to british gas after promises of lower bills .
but when he did not get any at all , he had to enlist the help of watchdog energywatch to get british gas to sort it out .
the power firm has finally sent him his bill for the past two years , taken off 10 % as a gesture of goodwill and given him three years to settle the balance .
i 'm surprised british gas manages to make millions if this joke is anything to judge them by kevin jackson mr jackson asked british gas , part of centrica , for electricity in november 2001 , but despite taking a meter reading a year later the bill was not issued .
mr jackson said : " i 'm surprised british gas manages to make millions if this joke is anything to judge them by .
" why they did n't want my money has never been explained to me . "
british gas told bbc news online a small number of customers had experienced difficulties when transferring their electricity , but added the issue had been well-publicised and was being dealt with .
a spokesman said : " these problems , relating to the transfer of customer 's data , have created difficulties for all suppliers in billing a small proportion customers - including in our case mr jackson .
" following our efforts this year we have already considerably reduced the overall number of delayed bills customers receive .
' realistic compensation ' " british gas provides discounts for all our customers affected as well as payment arrangements to suit their needs . "
but mr jackson said it was only taken seriously when he enlisted the help of energywatch .
energywatch 's north west chief david sidebottom welcomed the 10 % discount as " a start " but said the mistake was inexcusable .
he added : " a customer should not have to be reduced to pleading for a bill .
" we want to see compensation levels reflect the distress and inconvenience these billing blunders cause consumers . "

emi refused to give details of its bid - rumoured to be $ 1.6bn - but chairman eric nicoli said talks with time warner were " at an advanced stage " .
the group revealed adjusted pre-tax profits that were down 6.6 % to £ 39.4m in the six months to september .
sales at emi remained flat at £ 758.6m , but outperformed the global industry which saw sales fall by more than 10 % .
mr nicoli said that the negotiations to acquire time warner had " progressed well " .
" we have made a firm proposal to time warner which , we believe , would create substantial value for the shareholders of both companies , " he added .
a report in the financial times said the group had bid $ 1.6bn for its rival .
take-over battle ?
the takeover saga has been rumbling on for about two months , following an earlier failed attempt by the pair to link-up in 2000 .
why music companies feel the urge to merge meanwhile , the reuters news agency reported that sources close to the deal said emi might be planning to offer a $ 1bn sweetener to the us music giant .
the uk 's biggest music firm and time warner are expected to hold more talks on the deal on thursday .
but the plans could be upset by a rival offer launched by a consortium led by billionaire media investor haim saban and edgar bronfman , former chief executive of seagram .
the private offer is expected to value the whole of warner music - including its warner chappell music publishing arm - at about $ 2.5bn , reports suggest .
the move follows merger plans announced by music giants sony and bertelsmann music group earlier this month .
any such merger would allow firms to cut costs as they battle falling profits caused by widespread piracy and stiff competition .
emi 's roster of artists includes robbie williams , radiohead and norah jones .

emi refused to give details of its bid - rumoured to be $ 1.6bn - but chairman eric nicoli said talks with time warner were " at an advanced stage " .
the group revealed adjusted pre-tax profits that were down 6.6 % to £ 39.4m in the six months to september .
sales at emi remained flat at £ 758.6m , but outperformed the global industry which saw sales fall by more than 10 % .
mr nicoli said that the negotiations to acquire time warner had " progressed well " .
" we have made a firm proposal to time warner which , we believe , would create substantial value for the shareholders of both companies , " he added .
a report in the financial times said the group had bid $ 1.6bn for its rival .
take-over battle ?
the takeover saga has been rumbling on for about two months , following an earlier failed attempt by the pair to link-up in 2000 .
why music companies feel the urge to merge meanwhile , the reuters news agency reported that sources close to the deal said emi might be planning to offer a $ 1bn sweetener to the us music giant .
the uk 's biggest music firm and time warner are expected to hold more talks on the deal on thursday .
but the plans could be upset by a rival offer launched by a consortium led by billionaire media investor haim saban and edgar bronfman , former chief executive of seagram .
the private offer is expected to value the whole of warner music - including its warner chappell music publishing arm - at about $ 2.5bn , reports suggest .
the move follows merger plans announced by music giants sony and bertelsmann music group earlier this month .
any such merger would allow firms to cut costs as they battle falling profits caused by widespread piracy and stiff competition .
emi 's roster of artists includes robbie williams , radiohead and norah jones .

separatist forces would pay a " high cost " if they pushed ahead with formal independence , chinese media quoted a senior official as saying .
beijing has long threatened action against taiwan , which it sees as a renegade province .
correspondents say the threat , made four months before taiwan elections , is rarely put in such aggressive terms .
the remarks from wang zaixi , vice minister of china 's taiwan affairs office , are the most hardline public comments since taiwan last held presidential elections in 2000 .
president chen , who has formally declared his intention to seek re-election in march 's presidential elections , has signalled that he wants to make the debate over whether or not taiwan should declare independence the main issue of the election campaign , a move sure to further anger chinese authorities .
bbc correspondent francis markus says one of china 's main concerns is that president chen appears to be gaining popularity with the voters .
he is already a hate figure in beijing because of his party 's support for formal independence and now he seems to be hardening his stance on a new constitution for the island and a referendum on taiwan 's future , our correspondent adds .
china has threatened to reclaim taiwan through military means if the island ever formally declares independence .
it regards taiwan as a part of china although it has been governed separately since 1949 .
taiwan is formally recognised by fewer than 30 countries and was replaced at the united nations by china in 1971 .
