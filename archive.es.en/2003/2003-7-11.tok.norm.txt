the chancellor has enough of pasta ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder and his wife doris will be swapping the charms of the adriatic this year for the limited attractions of hanover .
the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .
" basta !
the chancellor has enough of pasta ! " screamed bild .
" ciao , bella italia ! "
the tabloid also printed a coupon , " fax this uncouth man out of office ! " , which readers could send to the italian embassy demanding the removal of italian deputy tourism minister stefano stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called german tourists " hypernationalistic , blond beach invaders , " earlier in the week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern league italian politician stefano stefani .
but unrestrained enthusiasm over the chancellor ’ s boycott of italy to spend his holiday was largely limited to the sensational bild .
though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .
" germans and their government should be self-confident enough to ignore the stupid comments of a subordinate italian politician , " business daily handelsblatt wrote .
" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that schröder ’ s move was making a mountain out of a molehill .
and even the local paper in schröder ’ s hometown hanover , where he will now spend his holiday , queried , " we were surprised that our chancellor took the words of any old junior minister so seriously .
hasn ’ t he overreacted ? "
holiday in rom , germany , rather than rome , italy ?
as fears grow among italy ’ s tourism industry of a possible fallout from the deepening diplomatic crisis -lrb- almost 10 million germans visit italy each year , spending more than eight billion euros -rrb- , the german chancellor has been flooded with offers for alternative holiday destinations .
kurt beck , state premier of rheinland-palatinate , invited schröder to rom , germany , rather than rome , italy .
" i have heard it said that rom in rheinland-palatinate is an idyllic , tranquil little place that is guaranteed to welcome outsiders , and where you can really relax , " beck said .
even pawel lewandowski , head of the polish tourist board , invited schröder and his family to visit poland ’ s version of " tuscany " instead .
" millions of germans have visited poland in past years and we can only confirm that they are always welcome as friendly , pleasant and open neighbors , " lewandowski said in an open letter to the chancellor .
" reciprocal visits contribute to reducing existing prejudices and helping europe grow together . "
similar offers poured in from austria , denmark and a clutch of local german hoteliers .
german-italian ties badly damaged ?
but the agonizing over where the german chancellor will spend his summer vacation aside , there are serious fears whether the german-italian relationship is on the rocks following a double set of insults hurled at germany last week .
gernot erler , a social democrat foreign policy expert , said in a radio interview the unfortunate italian comments could derail the european union and damage italy ’ s six-month eu presidency .
" it could lead to the whole european process , which really advanced in the last half year under greece ’ s excellent leadership , grinding to a halt .
that could also create a bad atmosphere which could even have economic consequences , " he said .
italian ambassador to germany silvio fagiolo rushed to allay fears that the ongoing row could have a negative effect on german-italian ties .
the ambassador said in a speech in berlin thursday that the two countries had too many things in common especially in european politics for ties to nosedive .
" neither of the two sides have indicated that it would negatively affect the diplomatic relationship , " he said .
meanwhile in italy ...
the repercussions of the snowballing crisis show no signs of dying down in italy .
tourism minister stefani finds himself in the eye of a diplomatic storm after making his derogatory comments on german tourists , saying they are " indoctrinated to feel top of the class whatever the situation . "
on friday opposition members of the conservative italian parliament called for his sacking for the " gravity , inappropriateness and irresponsibility of his statements . "
the liberal opposition said , " these statements have done grave damage to italy ’ s image , " while the governor of the italian region where schröder would have stayed compared stefani ’ s comments to a natural disaster .
" we intend to ask for political compensation for the serious damage inflicted on our region , " he said .
stefani , a member of the far-right northern league however has refused to apologize .

with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .
if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .
the alliance has been struggling to redefine its mission in the post-cold war era .

the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .
if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .

but he added that bavaria would naturally “ want to have answers to a series of questions , ” for example , whether the product can be used safely without physicians ’ supervision . hagemann said the prescription committee had found no risks associated with selling the pill without a prescription . they also looked into the social advantages , he told the frankfurter allgemeine : “ reducing the number of abortions among teenagers is an important issue .
other countries have had positive experiences . ” available in schools the morning-after pill has been available without prescription in britain for women over 16 years since the beginning of 2001 .
other countries where the pill is sold without prescriptions are france -lrb- where it is handed out by school nurses -rrb- , portugal , norway , sweden , finland , belgium , denmark and switzerland . the morning-after pill is based on the single hormone gestagen , and functions by preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus . it is not the same as the ru486 “ abortion pill , ” which causes a spontaneous miscarriage , and in fact will not terminate an already existent pregnancy . abortions among women between 15 and 18 years of age have risen in germany over the past six years , from 33 to 50 per 10,000 women . teenage pregnancies and the overall number of abortions have remained fairly stable . britain has the highest percentage of teen pregnancies in europe , 31 in 1,000 – more than twice as high as germany . only the united states ranks higher in industrial countries , with 52 in 1,000 women . while it is unclear whether having the morning-after pill available over the counter will actually slow the rate of teenage pregnancies and abortions , women ’ s rights and family-planning groups welcome the decision . “ it ’ s a great advantage because taking the pill is n't delayed by the necessity of visiting a doctor . international studies show that the pill is more effective the earlier it is taken , ” regine wlassitschau , of the german family-planning organization profamilia , told the frankfurter allgemeine .

european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility . italian daily la repubblica wrote that three months after the fall of the saddam regime , u.s. president george w. bush had to admit there ’ s a " security issue " in iraq .
the paper said every day brought new reasons to worry : a pentagon report has revealed that fatigue and bad equipment led to the capture of u.s. soldier jessica lynch .
one marine shot himself north of baghdad , and the first troops that return home are complaining about " great stress " .
this climate of insecurity within the u.s. could even worsen , the paper warned , as the justification of the iraq invasion is at stake because of claims washington used false proofs to go to war .
the spanish daily el mundo agreed and said not even u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld thinks that the banned weapons which have triggered this war will be found .
in a senate hearing he confessed that the bush administration had taken action without having new or relevant proofs against saddam hussein , the paper wrote , suggesting that this has become a serious threat to the credibility of u.s. president george w. bush .
london-based daily the independent took a different view and argued that invading iraq nevertheless was the right thing to do : " the clearest and most compelling argument for the war was simply that the iraqi people wanted it to happen .
it was the only way they could see to end the tyranny of saddam " , the paper said .

" the democrats will not miss any opportunity to put a spin on bush ’ s iraq mistakes with the american public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.07.2003 foreign tech workers still wanted in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wanted 20,000 foreign it specialists .
it got less than that .
germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance . had chancellor gerhard schröder 's government gotten its way , germany 's first immigration law would already be attracting highly-qualified workers to the country . but germany 's constitutional court threw out the proposed law in december 2003 , one month before it was to take effect .
the court ruled that the way the law was passed in germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , was unconstitutional . in place of the law is the policy germany has had since it first invited guest workers into the country in the 1950s .
an addition to that policy , the green card program , was quietly extended this week .
the move by economic minister wolfgang clement shows the social democratic-green party coalition is holding fast to at least part of its promise to pull qualified workers into germany . launched to a great fuss in 2000 , the program sought to bring in badly needed it specialists from eastern europe , india and russia to feed a booming industry .
that industry has all but collapsed , leaving a portion of the round 14,000 green card holders out of a job .
in munich , the home of one of the largest concentrations of green card holders , 7 percent had registered themselves as unemployed , according to a recent study . the situation fuels the arguments of christian democratic union politicians who say germany must do more to get the more than 4 million unemployed germans a job before focusing on bringing in immigrants . but economic experts are quick to point out that with every foreigner brought in , germans benefit . " they manage , through their special productive efficiency and willingness to be productive , to create more jobs , " said bernhard rohleder , of the it association , bitkom . in addition , they pay taxes , buy groceries and go out at night , contributing their share to keeping the german economy going , rohleder told deutsche welle .
the problem germany has is not bringing in enough of them . germany not very welcoming indeed , government officials hoped to have handed out 20,000 green cards by now .
but many candidates have been hesitant to go to a country where english is a second language and the nightly news carries reports on neo-nazi attacks on foreigners .
germany has n't done a good enough job of making the newcomers feel wanted , said christoph schmidt , president of the economic institute rwi . the usa and australia have no problem " bringing young people to their universities in order to … later integrate them as valuable members of the workforce , " schmidt said . the new immigration law foresaw more money and effort devoted to integrating foreigners already in germany . now , that money has been put on hold .
earlier this month , the government asked a committee involving members of both houses of parliament to examine the proposed law again .
but serious negotiations are n't expected to take place until the fall . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

the chancellor has enough of pasta ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder and his wife doris will be swapping the charms of the adriatic this year for the limited attractions of hanover .
the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .
" basta !
the chancellor has enough of pasta ! " screamed bild .
" ciao , bella italia ! "
the tabloid also printed a coupon , " fax this uncouth man out of office ! " , which readers could send to the italian embassy demanding the removal of italian deputy tourism minister stefano stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called german tourists " hypernationalistic , blond beach invaders , " earlier in the week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern league italian politician stefano stefani .
but unrestrained enthusiasm over the chancellor ’ s boycott of italy to spend his holiday was largely limited to the sensational bild .
though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .
" germans and their government should be self-confident enough to ignore the stupid comments of a subordinate italian politician , " business daily handelsblatt wrote .
" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that schröder ’ s move was making a mountain out of a molehill .
and even the local paper in schröder ’ s hometown hanover , where he will now spend his holiday , queried , " we were surprised that our chancellor took the words of any old junior minister so seriously .
hasn ’ t he overreacted ? "
holiday in rom , germany , rather than rome , italy ?
as fears grow among italy ’ s tourism industry of a possible fallout from the deepening diplomatic crisis -lrb- almost 10 million germans visit italy each year , spending more than eight billion euros -rrb- , the german chancellor has been flooded with offers for alternative holiday destinations .
kurt beck , state premier of rheinland-palatinate , invited schröder to rom , germany , rather than rome , italy .
" i have heard it said that rom in rheinland-palatinate is an idyllic , tranquil little place that is guaranteed to welcome outsiders , and where you can really relax , " beck said .
even pawel lewandowski , head of the polish tourist board , invited schröder and his family to visit poland ’ s version of " tuscany " instead .
" millions of germans have visited poland in past years and we can only confirm that they are always welcome as friendly , pleasant and open neighbors , " lewandowski said in an open letter to the chancellor .
" reciprocal visits contribute to reducing existing prejudices and helping europe grow together . "
similar offers poured in from austria , denmark and a clutch of local german hoteliers .
german-italian ties badly damaged ?
but the agonizing over where the german chancellor will spend his summer vacation aside , there are serious fears whether the german-italian relationship is on the rocks following a double set of insults hurled at germany last week .
gernot erler , a social democrat foreign policy expert , said in a radio interview the unfortunate italian comments could derail the european union and damage italy ’ s six-month eu presidency .
" it could lead to the whole european process , which really advanced in the last half year under greece ’ s excellent leadership , grinding to a halt .
that could also create a bad atmosphere which could even have economic consequences , " he said .
italian ambassador to germany silvio fagiolo rushed to allay fears that the ongoing row could have a negative effect on german-italian ties .
the ambassador said in a speech in berlin thursday that the two countries had too many things in common especially in european politics for ties to nosedive .
" neither of the two sides have indicated that it would negatively affect the diplomatic relationship , " he said .
meanwhile in italy ...
the repercussions of the snowballing crisis show no signs of dying down in italy .
tourism minister stefani finds himself in the eye of a diplomatic storm after making his derogatory comments on german tourists , saying they are " indoctrinated to feel top of the class whatever the situation . "
on friday opposition members of the conservative italian parliament called for his sacking for the " gravity , inappropriateness and irresponsibility of his statements . "
the liberal opposition said , " these statements have done grave damage to italy ’ s image , " while the governor of the italian region where schröder would have stayed compared stefani ’ s comments to a natural disaster .
" we intend to ask for political compensation for the serious damage inflicted on our region , " he said .
stefani , a member of the far-right northern league however has refused to apologize .
" i don ’ t hold anything against the germans .
i had a german wife for 20 years , " he said .
" but on certain types of germans i haven ’ t changed my mind , " he added . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor says ciao italia radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility . italian daily la repubblica wrote that three months after the fall of the saddam regime , u.s. president george w. bush had to admit there ’ s a " security issue " in iraq .
the paper said every day brought new reasons to worry : a pentagon report has revealed that fatigue and bad equipment led to the capture of u.s. soldier jessica lynch .
one marine shot himself north of baghdad , and the first troops that return home are complaining about " great stress " .
this climate of insecurity within the u.s. could even worsen , the paper warned , as the justification of the iraq invasion is at stake because of claims washington used false proofs to go to war .
the spanish daily el mundo agreed and said not even u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld thinks that the banned weapons which have triggered this war will be found .
in a senate hearing he confessed that the bush administration had taken action without having new or relevant proofs against saddam hussein , the paper wrote , suggesting that this has become a serious threat to the credibility of u.s. president george w. bush .
london-based daily the independent took a different view and argued that invading iraq nevertheless was the right thing to do : " the clearest and most compelling argument for the war was simply that the iraqi people wanted it to happen .
it was the only way they could see to end the tyranny of saddam " , the paper said .
that ’ s why it sees the morality of the war hinging on one simple question : " is iraq better or worse off now than under saddam ? "
der standard from austria suggested iraq could become a serious handicap for bush in the next presidential election campaign .
" the democrats will not miss any opportunity to put a spin on bush ’ s iraq mistakes with the american public .
the claim that the president lied could be especially dangerous , the paper pointed out , because who will believe the economic promises of a president who is known " not be one hundred percent strict about even the most sensitive national security information ? "
germany ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented on washington ’ s request to share the cost and responsibility of the iraq occupation with a coalition of countries , including france and germany .
yes , rumsfeld needs help , the paper stated .
but it warned that any satisfaction derived from it by the opponents of the iraq war should not go so far as to stop them from giving any assistance at all .
on the other hand , washington must understand that help has its price .
it can not distribute the burdens of occupation while at the same time keeping total control .
anyone who joins , must also be given a say , the paper said concluding : " it seems that the united nations could get their chance in iraq at last . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

other countries where the pill is sold without prescriptions are france -lrb- where it is handed out by school nurses -rrb- , portugal , norway , sweden , finland , belgium , denmark and switzerland . the morning-after pill is based on the single hormone gestagen , and functions by preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus . it is not the same as the ru486 “ abortion pill , ” which causes a spontaneous miscarriage , and in fact will not terminate an already existent pregnancy . abortions among women between 15 and 18 years of age have risen in germany over the past six years , from 33 to 50 per 10,000 women . teenage pregnancies and the overall number of abortions have remained fairly stable . britain has the highest percentage of teen pregnancies in europe , 31 in 1,000 – more than twice as high as germany . only the united states ranks higher in industrial countries , with 52 in 1,000 women . while it is unclear whether having the morning-after pill available over the counter will actually slow the rate of teenage pregnancies and abortions , women ’ s rights and family-planning groups welcome the decision . “ it ’ s a great advantage because taking the pill is n't delayed by the necessity of visiting a doctor . international studies show that the pill is more effective the earlier it is taken , ” regine wlassitschau , of the german family-planning organization profamilia , told the frankfurter allgemeine .

with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .
if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .
the alliance has been struggling to redefine its mission in the post-cold war era .

the chancellor has enough of pasta ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder and his wife doris will be swapping the charms of the adriatic this year for the limited attractions of hanover .
the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .
" basta !
the chancellor has enough of pasta ! " screamed bild .
" ciao , bella italia ! "
the tabloid also printed a coupon , " fax this uncouth man out of office ! " , which readers could send to the italian embassy demanding the removal of italian deputy tourism minister stefano stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called german tourists " hypernationalistic , blond beach invaders , " earlier in the week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern league italian politician stefano stefani .
but unrestrained enthusiasm over the chancellor ’ s boycott of italy to spend his holiday was largely limited to the sensational bild .
though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .
" germans and their government should be self-confident enough to ignore the stupid comments of a subordinate italian politician , " business daily handelsblatt wrote .
" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that schröder ’ s move was making a mountain out of a molehill .
and even the local paper in schröder ’ s hometown hanover , where he will now spend his holiday , queried , " we were surprised that our chancellor took the words of any old junior minister so seriously .
hasn ’ t he overreacted ? "
holiday in rom , germany , rather than rome , italy ?
as fears grow among italy ’ s tourism industry of a possible fallout from the deepening diplomatic crisis -lrb- almost 10 million germans visit italy each year , spending more than eight billion euros -rrb- , the german chancellor has been flooded with offers for alternative holiday destinations .
kurt beck , state premier of rheinland-palatinate , invited schröder to rom , germany , rather than rome , italy .
" i have heard it said that rom in rheinland-palatinate is an idyllic , tranquil little place that is guaranteed to welcome outsiders , and where you can really relax , " beck said .
even pawel lewandowski , head of the polish tourist board , invited schröder and his family to visit poland ’ s version of " tuscany " instead .
" millions of germans have visited poland in past years and we can only confirm that they are always welcome as friendly , pleasant and open neighbors , " lewandowski said in an open letter to the chancellor .
" reciprocal visits contribute to reducing existing prejudices and helping europe grow together . "
similar offers poured in from austria , denmark and a clutch of local german hoteliers .
german-italian ties badly damaged ?
but the agonizing over where the german chancellor will spend his summer vacation aside , there are serious fears whether the german-italian relationship is on the rocks following a double set of insults hurled at germany last week .
gernot erler , a social democrat foreign policy expert , said in a radio interview the unfortunate italian comments could derail the european union and damage italy ’ s six-month eu presidency .
" it could lead to the whole european process , which really advanced in the last half year under greece ’ s excellent leadership , grinding to a halt .
that could also create a bad atmosphere which could even have economic consequences , " he said .
italian ambassador to germany silvio fagiolo rushed to allay fears that the ongoing row could have a negative effect on german-italian ties .
the ambassador said in a speech in berlin thursday that the two countries had too many things in common especially in european politics for ties to nosedive .
" neither of the two sides have indicated that it would negatively affect the diplomatic relationship , " he said .
meanwhile in italy ...
the repercussions of the snowballing crisis show no signs of dying down in italy .
tourism minister stefani finds himself in the eye of a diplomatic storm after making his derogatory comments on german tourists , saying they are " indoctrinated to feel top of the class whatever the situation . "
on friday opposition members of the conservative italian parliament called for his sacking for the " gravity , inappropriateness and irresponsibility of his statements . "
the liberal opposition said , " these statements have done grave damage to italy ’ s image , " while the governor of the italian region where schröder would have stayed compared stefani ’ s comments to a natural disaster .
" we intend to ask for political compensation for the serious damage inflicted on our region , " he said .
stefani , a member of the far-right northern league however has refused to apologize .

the chancellor has enough of pasta ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder and his wife doris will be swapping the charms of the adriatic this year for the limited attractions of hanover .
the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .
" basta !
the chancellor has enough of pasta ! " screamed bild .
" ciao , bella italia ! "
the tabloid also printed a coupon , " fax this uncouth man out of office ! " , which readers could send to the italian embassy demanding the removal of italian deputy tourism minister stefano stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called german tourists " hypernationalistic , blond beach invaders , " earlier in the week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern league italian politician stefano stefani .
but unrestrained enthusiasm over the chancellor ’ s boycott of italy to spend his holiday was largely limited to the sensational bild .
though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .
" germans and their government should be self-confident enough to ignore the stupid comments of a subordinate italian politician , " business daily handelsblatt wrote .
" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that schröder ’ s move was making a mountain out of a molehill .
and even the local paper in schröder ’ s hometown hanover , where he will now spend his holiday , queried , " we were surprised that our chancellor took the words of any old junior minister so seriously .
hasn ’ t he overreacted ? "
holiday in rom , germany , rather than rome , italy ?
as fears grow among italy ’ s tourism industry of a possible fallout from the deepening diplomatic crisis -lrb- almost 10 million germans visit italy each year , spending more than eight billion euros -rrb- , the german chancellor has been flooded with offers for alternative holiday destinations .
kurt beck , state premier of rheinland-palatinate , invited schröder to rom , germany , rather than rome , italy .
" i have heard it said that rom in rheinland-palatinate is an idyllic , tranquil little place that is guaranteed to welcome outsiders , and where you can really relax , " beck said .
even pawel lewandowski , head of the polish tourist board , invited schröder and his family to visit poland ’ s version of " tuscany " instead .
" millions of germans have visited poland in past years and we can only confirm that they are always welcome as friendly , pleasant and open neighbors , " lewandowski said in an open letter to the chancellor .
" reciprocal visits contribute to reducing existing prejudices and helping europe grow together . "
similar offers poured in from austria , denmark and a clutch of local german hoteliers .
german-italian ties badly damaged ?
but the agonizing over where the german chancellor will spend his summer vacation aside , there are serious fears whether the german-italian relationship is on the rocks following a double set of insults hurled at germany last week .
gernot erler , a social democrat foreign policy expert , said in a radio interview the unfortunate italian comments could derail the european union and damage italy ’ s six-month eu presidency .
" it could lead to the whole european process , which really advanced in the last half year under greece ’ s excellent leadership , grinding to a halt .
that could also create a bad atmosphere which could even have economic consequences , " he said .
italian ambassador to germany silvio fagiolo rushed to allay fears that the ongoing row could have a negative effect on german-italian ties .
the ambassador said in a speech in berlin thursday that the two countries had too many things in common especially in european politics for ties to nosedive .
" neither of the two sides have indicated that it would negatively affect the diplomatic relationship , " he said .
meanwhile in italy ...
the repercussions of the snowballing crisis show no signs of dying down in italy .
tourism minister stefani finds himself in the eye of a diplomatic storm after making his derogatory comments on german tourists , saying they are " indoctrinated to feel top of the class whatever the situation . "
on friday opposition members of the conservative italian parliament called for his sacking for the " gravity , inappropriateness and irresponsibility of his statements . "
the liberal opposition said , " these statements have done grave damage to italy ’ s image , " while the governor of the italian region where schröder would have stayed compared stefani ’ s comments to a natural disaster .
" we intend to ask for political compensation for the serious damage inflicted on our region , " he said .

european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility . italian daily la repubblica wrote that three months after the fall of the saddam regime , u.s. president george w. bush had to admit there ’ s a " security issue " in iraq .
the paper said every day brought new reasons to worry : a pentagon report has revealed that fatigue and bad equipment led to the capture of u.s. soldier jessica lynch .
one marine shot himself north of baghdad , and the first troops that return home are complaining about " great stress " .
this climate of insecurity within the u.s. could even worsen , the paper warned , as the justification of the iraq invasion is at stake because of claims washington used false proofs to go to war .
the spanish daily el mundo agreed and said not even u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld thinks that the banned weapons which have triggered this war will be found .
in a senate hearing he confessed that the bush administration had taken action without having new or relevant proofs against saddam hussein , the paper wrote , suggesting that this has become a serious threat to the credibility of u.s. president george w. bush .
london-based daily the independent took a different view and argued that invading iraq nevertheless was the right thing to do : " the clearest and most compelling argument for the war was simply that the iraqi people wanted it to happen .
it was the only way they could see to end the tyranny of saddam " , the paper said .
that ’ s why it sees the morality of the war hinging on one simple question : " is iraq better or worse off now than under saddam ? "
der standard from austria suggested iraq could become a serious handicap for bush in the next presidential election campaign .
" the democrats will not miss any opportunity to put a spin on bush ’ s iraq mistakes with the american public .
the claim that the president lied could be especially dangerous , the paper pointed out , because who will believe the economic promises of a president who is known " not be one hundred percent strict about even the most sensitive national security information ? "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.07.2003 foreign tech workers still wanted in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wanted 20,000 foreign it specialists .
it got less than that .
germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance . had chancellor gerhard schröder 's government gotten its way , germany 's first immigration law would already be attracting highly-qualified workers to the country . but germany 's constitutional court threw out the proposed law in december 2003 , one month before it was to take effect .
the court ruled that the way the law was passed in germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , was unconstitutional . in place of the law is the policy germany has had since it first invited guest workers into the country in the 1950s .
an addition to that policy , the green card program , was quietly extended this week .
the move by economic minister wolfgang clement shows the social democratic-green party coalition is holding fast to at least part of its promise to pull qualified workers into germany . launched to a great fuss in 2000 , the program sought to bring in badly needed it specialists from eastern europe , india and russia to feed a booming industry .
that industry has all but collapsed , leaving a portion of the round 14,000 green card holders out of a job .
in munich , the home of one of the largest concentrations of green card holders , 7 percent had registered themselves as unemployed , according to a recent study . the situation fuels the arguments of christian democratic union politicians who say germany must do more to get the more than 4 million unemployed germans a job before focusing on bringing in immigrants . but economic experts are quick to point out that with every foreigner brought in , germans benefit . " they manage , through their special productive efficiency and willingness to be productive , to create more jobs , " said bernhard rohleder , of the it association , bitkom . in addition , they pay taxes , buy groceries and go out at night , contributing their share to keeping the german economy going , rohleder told deutsche welle .
the problem germany has is not bringing in enough of them . germany not very welcoming indeed , government officials hoped to have handed out 20,000 green cards by now .
but many candidates have been hesitant to go to a country where english is a second language and the nightly news carries reports on neo-nazi attacks on foreigners .
germany has n't done a good enough job of making the newcomers feel wanted , said christoph schmidt , president of the economic institute rwi . the usa and australia have no problem " bringing young people to their universities in order to … later integrate them as valuable members of the workforce , " schmidt said . the new immigration law foresaw more money and effort devoted to integrating foreigners already in germany . now , that money has been put on hold .
earlier this month , the government asked a committee involving members of both houses of parliament to examine the proposed law again .
but serious negotiations are n't expected to take place until the fall . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance . had chancellor gerhard schröder 's government gotten its way , germany 's first immigration law would already be attracting highly-qualified workers to the country . but germany 's constitutional court threw out the proposed law in december 2003 , one month before it was to take effect .
the court ruled that the way the law was passed in germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , was unconstitutional . in place of the law is the policy germany has had since it first invited guest workers into the country in the 1950s .

in munich , the home of one of the largest concentrations of green card holders , 7 percent had registered themselves as unemployed , according to a recent study . the situation fuels the arguments of christian democratic union politicians who say germany must do more to get the more than 4 million unemployed germans a job before focusing on bringing in immigrants . but economic experts are quick to point out that with every foreigner brought in , germans benefit . " they manage , through their special productive efficiency and willingness to be productive , to create more jobs , " said bernhard rohleder , of the it association , bitkom . in addition , they pay taxes , buy groceries and go out at night , contributing their share to keeping the german economy going , rohleder told deutsche welle .

european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility . italian daily la repubblica wrote that three months after the fall of the saddam regime , u.s. president george w. bush had to admit there ’ s a " security issue " in iraq .
the paper said every day brought new reasons to worry : a pentagon report has revealed that fatigue and bad equipment led to the capture of u.s. soldier jessica lynch .
one marine shot himself north of baghdad , and the first troops that return home are complaining about " great stress " .
this climate of insecurity within the u.s. could even worsen , the paper warned , as the justification of the iraq invasion is at stake because of claims washington used false proofs to go to war .
the spanish daily el mundo agreed and said not even u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld thinks that the banned weapons which have triggered this war will be found .
in a senate hearing he confessed that the bush administration had taken action without having new or relevant proofs against saddam hussein , the paper wrote , suggesting that this has become a serious threat to the credibility of u.s. president george w. bush .
london-based daily the independent took a different view and argued that invading iraq nevertheless was the right thing to do : " the clearest and most compelling argument for the war was simply that the iraqi people wanted it to happen .
it was the only way they could see to end the tyranny of saddam " , the paper said .
that ’ s why it sees the morality of the war hinging on one simple question : " is iraq better or worse off now than under saddam ? "
der standard from austria suggested iraq could become a serious handicap for bush in the next presidential election campaign .
" the democrats will not miss any opportunity to put a spin on bush ’ s iraq mistakes with the american public .
the claim that the president lied could be especially dangerous , the paper pointed out , because who will believe the economic promises of a president who is known " not be one hundred percent strict about even the most sensitive national security information ? "
germany ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented on washington ’ s request to share the cost and responsibility of the iraq occupation with a coalition of countries , including france and germany .
yes , rumsfeld needs help , the paper stated .
but it warned that any satisfaction derived from it by the opponents of the iraq war should not go so far as to stop them from giving any assistance at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2003 u.s. expected to ask germany , france to send troops to iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. says it will need help bringing iraq under control .
with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .
if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .

the chancellor has enough of pasta ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder and his wife doris will be swapping the charms of the adriatic this year for the limited attractions of hanover .
the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .
" basta !
the chancellor has enough of pasta ! " screamed bild .
" ciao , bella italia ! "
the tabloid also printed a coupon , " fax this uncouth man out of office ! " , which readers could send to the italian embassy demanding the removal of italian deputy tourism minister stefano stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called german tourists " hypernationalistic , blond beach invaders , " earlier in the week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern league italian politician stefano stefani .
but unrestrained enthusiasm over the chancellor ’ s boycott of italy to spend his holiday was largely limited to the sensational bild .
though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .
" germans and their government should be self-confident enough to ignore the stupid comments of a subordinate italian politician , " business daily handelsblatt wrote .
" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that schröder ’ s move was making a mountain out of a molehill .
and even the local paper in schröder ’ s hometown hanover , where he will now spend his holiday , queried , " we were surprised that our chancellor took the words of any old junior minister so seriously .
hasn ’ t he overreacted ? "
holiday in rom , germany , rather than rome , italy ?
as fears grow among italy ’ s tourism industry of a possible fallout from the deepening diplomatic crisis -lrb- almost 10 million germans visit italy each year , spending more than eight billion euros -rrb- , the german chancellor has been flooded with offers for alternative holiday destinations .
kurt beck , state premier of rheinland-palatinate , invited schröder to rom , germany , rather than rome , italy .
" i have heard it said that rom in rheinland-palatinate is an idyllic , tranquil little place that is guaranteed to welcome outsiders , and where you can really relax , " beck said .
even pawel lewandowski , head of the polish tourist board , invited schröder and his family to visit poland ’ s version of " tuscany " instead .
" millions of germans have visited poland in past years and we can only confirm that they are always welcome as friendly , pleasant and open neighbors , " lewandowski said in an open letter to the chancellor .
" reciprocal visits contribute to reducing existing prejudices and helping europe grow together . "
similar offers poured in from austria , denmark and a clutch of local german hoteliers .
german-italian ties badly damaged ?
but the agonizing over where the german chancellor will spend his summer vacation aside , there are serious fears whether the german-italian relationship is on the rocks following a double set of insults hurled at germany last week .
gernot erler , a social democrat foreign policy expert , said in a radio interview the unfortunate italian comments could derail the european union and damage italy ’ s six-month eu presidency .
" it could lead to the whole european process , which really advanced in the last half year under greece ’ s excellent leadership , grinding to a halt .
that could also create a bad atmosphere which could even have economic consequences , " he said .
italian ambassador to germany silvio fagiolo rushed to allay fears that the ongoing row could have a negative effect on german-italian ties .
the ambassador said in a speech in berlin thursday that the two countries had too many things in common especially in european politics for ties to nosedive .
" neither of the two sides have indicated that it would negatively affect the diplomatic relationship , " he said .
meanwhile in italy ...
the repercussions of the snowballing crisis show no signs of dying down in italy .
tourism minister stefani finds himself in the eye of a diplomatic storm after making his derogatory comments on german tourists , saying they are " indoctrinated to feel top of the class whatever the situation . "
on friday opposition members of the conservative italian parliament called for his sacking for the " gravity , inappropriateness and irresponsibility of his statements . "
the liberal opposition said , " these statements have done grave damage to italy ’ s image , " while the governor of the italian region where schröder would have stayed compared stefani ’ s comments to a natural disaster .
" we intend to ask for political compensation for the serious damage inflicted on our region , " he said .
stefani , a member of the far-right northern league however has refused to apologize .

it got less than that .
germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance . had chancellor gerhard schröder 's government gotten its way , germany 's first immigration law would already be attracting highly-qualified workers to the country . but germany 's constitutional court threw out the proposed law in december 2003 , one month before it was to take effect .
the court ruled that the way the law was passed in germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , was unconstitutional . in place of the law is the policy germany has had since it first invited guest workers into the country in the 1950s .
an addition to that policy , the green card program , was quietly extended this week .
the move by economic minister wolfgang clement shows the social democratic-green party coalition is holding fast to at least part of its promise to pull qualified workers into germany . launched to a great fuss in 2000 , the program sought to bring in badly needed it specialists from eastern europe , india and russia to feed a booming industry .
that industry has all but collapsed , leaving a portion of the round 14,000 green card holders out of a job .
in munich , the home of one of the largest concentrations of green card holders , 7 percent had registered themselves as unemployed , according to a recent study . the situation fuels the arguments of christian democratic union politicians who say germany must do more to get the more than 4 million unemployed germans a job before focusing on bringing in immigrants . but economic experts are quick to point out that with every foreigner brought in , germans benefit . " they manage , through their special productive efficiency and willingness to be productive , to create more jobs , " said bernhard rohleder , of the it association , bitkom . in addition , they pay taxes , buy groceries and go out at night , contributing their share to keeping the german economy going , rohleder told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.07.2003 european press review : the u.n. could at last get its chance in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while u.s. president bush along with daughter barbara pets elephants in botswana , european papers fret about his policies in iraq .
european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility . italian daily la repubblica wrote that three months after the fall of the saddam regime , u.s. president george w. bush had to admit there ’ s a " security issue " in iraq .
the paper said every day brought new reasons to worry : a pentagon report has revealed that fatigue and bad equipment led to the capture of u.s. soldier jessica lynch .
one marine shot himself north of baghdad , and the first troops that return home are complaining about " great stress " .
this climate of insecurity within the u.s. could even worsen , the paper warned , as the justification of the iraq invasion is at stake because of claims washington used false proofs to go to war .
the spanish daily el mundo agreed and said not even u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld thinks that the banned weapons which have triggered this war will be found .
in a senate hearing he confessed that the bush administration had taken action without having new or relevant proofs against saddam hussein , the paper wrote , suggesting that this has become a serious threat to the credibility of u.s. president george w. bush .
london-based daily the independent took a different view and argued that invading iraq nevertheless was the right thing to do : " the clearest and most compelling argument for the war was simply that the iraqi people wanted it to happen .
it was the only way they could see to end the tyranny of saddam " , the paper said .
that ’ s why it sees the morality of the war hinging on one simple question : " is iraq better or worse off now than under saddam ? "
der standard from austria suggested iraq could become a serious handicap for bush in the next presidential election campaign .
" the democrats will not miss any opportunity to put a spin on bush ’ s iraq mistakes with the american public .
the claim that the president lied could be especially dangerous , the paper pointed out , because who will believe the economic promises of a president who is known " not be one hundred percent strict about even the most sensitive national security information ? "
germany ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented on washington ’ s request to share the cost and responsibility of the iraq occupation with a coalition of countries , including france and germany .
yes , rumsfeld needs help , the paper stated .
but it warned that any satisfaction derived from it by the opponents of the iraq war should not go so far as to stop them from giving any assistance at all .
on the other hand , washington must understand that help has its price .
it can not distribute the burdens of occupation while at the same time keeping total control .
anyone who joins , must also be given a say , the paper said concluding : " it seems that the united nations could get their chance in iraq at last . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility . italian daily la repubblica wrote that three months after the fall of the saddam regime , u.s. president george w. bush had to admit there ’ s a " security issue " in iraq .
the paper said every day brought new reasons to worry : a pentagon report has revealed that fatigue and bad equipment led to the capture of u.s. soldier jessica lynch .
one marine shot himself north of baghdad , and the first troops that return home are complaining about " great stress " .
this climate of insecurity within the u.s. could even worsen , the paper warned , as the justification of the iraq invasion is at stake because of claims washington used false proofs to go to war .
the spanish daily el mundo agreed and said not even u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld thinks that the banned weapons which have triggered this war will be found .
in a senate hearing he confessed that the bush administration had taken action without having new or relevant proofs against saddam hussein , the paper wrote , suggesting that this has become a serious threat to the credibility of u.s. president george w. bush .
london-based daily the independent took a different view and argued that invading iraq nevertheless was the right thing to do : " the clearest and most compelling argument for the war was simply that the iraqi people wanted it to happen .
it was the only way they could see to end the tyranny of saddam " , the paper said .
that ’ s why it sees the morality of the war hinging on one simple question : " is iraq better or worse off now than under saddam ? "
der standard from austria suggested iraq could become a serious handicap for bush in the next presidential election campaign .
" the democrats will not miss any opportunity to put a spin on bush ’ s iraq mistakes with the american public .
the claim that the president lied could be especially dangerous , the paper pointed out , because who will believe the economic promises of a president who is known " not be one hundred percent strict about even the most sensitive national security information ? "
germany ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented on washington ’ s request to share the cost and responsibility of the iraq occupation with a coalition of countries , including france and germany .
yes , rumsfeld needs help , the paper stated .
but it warned that any satisfaction derived from it by the opponents of the iraq war should not go so far as to stop them from giving any assistance at all .
on the other hand , washington must understand that help has its price .
it can not distribute the burdens of occupation while at the same time keeping total control .
anyone who joins , must also be given a say , the paper said concluding : " it seems that the united nations could get their chance in iraq at last . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the chancellor has enough of pasta ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder and his wife doris will be swapping the charms of the adriatic this year for the limited attractions of hanover .
the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .
" basta !
the chancellor has enough of pasta ! " screamed bild .
" ciao , bella italia ! "
the tabloid also printed a coupon , " fax this uncouth man out of office ! " , which readers could send to the italian embassy demanding the removal of italian deputy tourism minister stefano stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called german tourists " hypernationalistic , blond beach invaders , " earlier in the week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern league italian politician stefano stefani .
but unrestrained enthusiasm over the chancellor ’ s boycott of italy to spend his holiday was largely limited to the sensational bild .
though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .
" germans and their government should be self-confident enough to ignore the stupid comments of a subordinate italian politician , " business daily handelsblatt wrote .
" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that schröder ’ s move was making a mountain out of a molehill .
and even the local paper in schröder ’ s hometown hanover , where he will now spend his holiday , queried , " we were surprised that our chancellor took the words of any old junior minister so seriously .
hasn ’ t he overreacted ? "
holiday in rom , germany , rather than rome , italy ?
as fears grow among italy ’ s tourism industry of a possible fallout from the deepening diplomatic crisis -lrb- almost 10 million germans visit italy each year , spending more than eight billion euros -rrb- , the german chancellor has been flooded with offers for alternative holiday destinations .
kurt beck , state premier of rheinland-palatinate , invited schröder to rom , germany , rather than rome , italy .
" i have heard it said that rom in rheinland-palatinate is an idyllic , tranquil little place that is guaranteed to welcome outsiders , and where you can really relax , " beck said .
even pawel lewandowski , head of the polish tourist board , invited schröder and his family to visit poland ’ s version of " tuscany " instead .
" millions of germans have visited poland in past years and we can only confirm that they are always welcome as friendly , pleasant and open neighbors , " lewandowski said in an open letter to the chancellor .
" reciprocal visits contribute to reducing existing prejudices and helping europe grow together . "
similar offers poured in from austria , denmark and a clutch of local german hoteliers .
german-italian ties badly damaged ?
but the agonizing over where the german chancellor will spend his summer vacation aside , there are serious fears whether the german-italian relationship is on the rocks following a double set of insults hurled at germany last week .
gernot erler , a social democrat foreign policy expert , said in a radio interview the unfortunate italian comments could derail the european union and damage italy ’ s six-month eu presidency .
" it could lead to the whole european process , which really advanced in the last half year under greece ’ s excellent leadership , grinding to a halt .
that could also create a bad atmosphere which could even have economic consequences , " he said .
italian ambassador to germany silvio fagiolo rushed to allay fears that the ongoing row could have a negative effect on german-italian ties .
the ambassador said in a speech in berlin thursday that the two countries had too many things in common especially in european politics for ties to nosedive .
" neither of the two sides have indicated that it would negatively affect the diplomatic relationship , " he said .
meanwhile in italy ...
the repercussions of the snowballing crisis show no signs of dying down in italy .
tourism minister stefani finds himself in the eye of a diplomatic storm after making his derogatory comments on german tourists , saying they are " indoctrinated to feel top of the class whatever the situation . "
on friday opposition members of the conservative italian parliament called for his sacking for the " gravity , inappropriateness and irresponsibility of his statements . "
the liberal opposition said , " these statements have done grave damage to italy ’ s image , " while the governor of the italian region where schröder would have stayed compared stefani ’ s comments to a natural disaster .
" we intend to ask for political compensation for the serious damage inflicted on our region , " he said .
stefani , a member of the far-right northern league however has refused to apologize .
" i don ’ t hold anything against the germans .
i had a german wife for 20 years , " he said .
" but on certain types of germans i haven ’ t changed my mind , " he added . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor says ciao italia 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .
if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .
the alliance has been struggling to redefine its mission in the post-cold war era .
next week , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to make his first trip to the united states since the war and some in government circles fear troop participation could become an issue , even though it 's not on the planned agenda . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris , warsaw try to heal iraq rift the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations .

but he added that bavaria would naturally “ want to have answers to a series of questions , ” for example , whether the product can be used safely without physicians ’ supervision . hagemann said the prescription committee had found no risks associated with selling the pill without a prescription . they also looked into the social advantages , he told the frankfurter allgemeine : “ reducing the number of abortions among teenagers is an important issue .
other countries have had positive experiences . ” available in schools the morning-after pill has been available without prescription in britain for women over 16 years since the beginning of 2001 .
other countries where the pill is sold without prescriptions are france -lrb- where it is handed out by school nurses -rrb- , portugal , norway , sweden , finland , belgium , denmark and switzerland . the morning-after pill is based on the single hormone gestagen , and functions by preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus . it is not the same as the ru486 “ abortion pill , ” which causes a spontaneous miscarriage , and in fact will not terminate an already existent pregnancy . abortions among women between 15 and 18 years of age have risen in germany over the past six years , from 33 to 50 per 10,000 women . teenage pregnancies and the overall number of abortions have remained fairly stable . britain has the highest percentage of teen pregnancies in europe , 31 in 1,000 – more than twice as high as germany . only the united states ranks higher in industrial countries , with 52 in 1,000 women . while it is unclear whether having the morning-after pill available over the counter will actually slow the rate of teenage pregnancies and abortions , women ’ s rights and family-planning groups welcome the decision . “ it ’ s a great advantage because taking the pill is n't delayed by the necessity of visiting a doctor . international studies show that the pill is more effective the earlier it is taken , ” regine wlassitschau , of the german family-planning organization profamilia , told the frankfurter allgemeine .

if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .
the alliance has been struggling to redefine its mission in the post-cold war era .

it got less than that .
germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance . had chancellor gerhard schröder 's government gotten its way , germany 's first immigration law would already be attracting highly-qualified workers to the country . but germany 's constitutional court threw out the proposed law in december 2003 , one month before it was to take effect .
the court ruled that the way the law was passed in germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , was unconstitutional . in place of the law is the policy germany has had since it first invited guest workers into the country in the 1950s .
an addition to that policy , the green card program , was quietly extended this week .
the move by economic minister wolfgang clement shows the social democratic-green party coalition is holding fast to at least part of its promise to pull qualified workers into germany . launched to a great fuss in 2000 , the program sought to bring in badly needed it specialists from eastern europe , india and russia to feed a booming industry .
that industry has all but collapsed , leaving a portion of the round 14,000 green card holders out of a job .
in munich , the home of one of the largest concentrations of green card holders , 7 percent had registered themselves as unemployed , according to a recent study . the situation fuels the arguments of christian democratic union politicians who say germany must do more to get the more than 4 million unemployed germans a job before focusing on bringing in immigrants . but economic experts are quick to point out that with every foreigner brought in , germans benefit . " they manage , through their special productive efficiency and willingness to be productive , to create more jobs , " said bernhard rohleder , of the it association , bitkom . in addition , they pay taxes , buy groceries and go out at night , contributing their share to keeping the german economy going , rohleder told deutsche welle .
the problem germany has is not bringing in enough of them . germany not very welcoming indeed , government officials hoped to have handed out 20,000 green cards by now .
but many candidates have been hesitant to go to a country where english is a second language and the nightly news carries reports on neo-nazi attacks on foreigners .
germany has n't done a good enough job of making the newcomers feel wanted , said christoph schmidt , president of the economic institute rwi . the usa and australia have no problem " bringing young people to their universities in order to … later integrate them as valuable members of the workforce , " schmidt said . the new immigration law foresaw more money and effort devoted to integrating foreigners already in germany . now , that money has been put on hold .
earlier this month , the government asked a committee involving members of both houses of parliament to examine the proposed law again .
but serious negotiations are n't expected to take place until the fall . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .

with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .

european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility . italian daily la repubblica wrote that three months after the fall of the saddam regime , u.s. president george w. bush had to admit there ’ s a " security issue " in iraq .
the paper said every day brought new reasons to worry : a pentagon report has revealed that fatigue and bad equipment led to the capture of u.s. soldier jessica lynch .
one marine shot himself north of baghdad , and the first troops that return home are complaining about " great stress " .
this climate of insecurity within the u.s. could even worsen , the paper warned , as the justification of the iraq invasion is at stake because of claims washington used false proofs to go to war .
the spanish daily el mundo agreed and said not even u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld thinks that the banned weapons which have triggered this war will be found .
in a senate hearing he confessed that the bush administration had taken action without having new or relevant proofs against saddam hussein , the paper wrote , suggesting that this has become a serious threat to the credibility of u.s. president george w. bush .
london-based daily the independent took a different view and argued that invading iraq nevertheless was the right thing to do : " the clearest and most compelling argument for the war was simply that the iraqi people wanted it to happen .
it was the only way they could see to end the tyranny of saddam " , the paper said .
that ’ s why it sees the morality of the war hinging on one simple question : " is iraq better or worse off now than under saddam ? "
der standard from austria suggested iraq could become a serious handicap for bush in the next presidential election campaign .
" the democrats will not miss any opportunity to put a spin on bush ’ s iraq mistakes with the american public .
the claim that the president lied could be especially dangerous , the paper pointed out , because who will believe the economic promises of a president who is known " not be one hundred percent strict about even the most sensitive national security information ? "
germany ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented on washington ’ s request to share the cost and responsibility of the iraq occupation with a coalition of countries , including france and germany .
yes , rumsfeld needs help , the paper stated .
but it warned that any satisfaction derived from it by the opponents of the iraq war should not go so far as to stop them from giving any assistance at all .
on the other hand , washington must understand that help has its price .
it can not distribute the burdens of occupation while at the same time keeping total control .

european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility . italian daily la repubblica wrote that three months after the fall of the saddam regime , u.s. president george w. bush had to admit there ’ s a " security issue " in iraq .
the paper said every day brought new reasons to worry : a pentagon report has revealed that fatigue and bad equipment led to the capture of u.s. soldier jessica lynch .
one marine shot himself north of baghdad , and the first troops that return home are complaining about " great stress " .
this climate of insecurity within the u.s. could even worsen , the paper warned , as the justification of the iraq invasion is at stake because of claims washington used false proofs to go to war .
the spanish daily el mundo agreed and said not even u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld thinks that the banned weapons which have triggered this war will be found .
in a senate hearing he confessed that the bush administration had taken action without having new or relevant proofs against saddam hussein , the paper wrote , suggesting that this has become a serious threat to the credibility of u.s. president george w. bush .
london-based daily the independent took a different view and argued that invading iraq nevertheless was the right thing to do : " the clearest and most compelling argument for the war was simply that the iraqi people wanted it to happen .
it was the only way they could see to end the tyranny of saddam " , the paper said .
that ’ s why it sees the morality of the war hinging on one simple question : " is iraq better or worse off now than under saddam ? "
der standard from austria suggested iraq could become a serious handicap for bush in the next presidential election campaign .
" the democrats will not miss any opportunity to put a spin on bush ’ s iraq mistakes with the american public .
the claim that the president lied could be especially dangerous , the paper pointed out , because who will believe the economic promises of a president who is known " not be one hundred percent strict about even the most sensitive national security information ? "
germany ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented on washington ’ s request to share the cost and responsibility of the iraq occupation with a coalition of countries , including france and germany .
yes , rumsfeld needs help , the paper stated .
but it warned that any satisfaction derived from it by the opponents of the iraq war should not go so far as to stop them from giving any assistance at all .
on the other hand , washington must understand that help has its price .
it can not distribute the burdens of occupation while at the same time keeping total control .
anyone who joins , must also be given a say , the paper said concluding : " it seems that the united nations could get their chance in iraq at last . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it got less than that .
germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance . had chancellor gerhard schröder 's government gotten its way , germany 's first immigration law would already be attracting highly-qualified workers to the country . but germany 's constitutional court threw out the proposed law in december 2003 , one month before it was to take effect .
the court ruled that the way the law was passed in germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , was unconstitutional . in place of the law is the policy germany has had since it first invited guest workers into the country in the 1950s .
an addition to that policy , the green card program , was quietly extended this week .
the move by economic minister wolfgang clement shows the social democratic-green party coalition is holding fast to at least part of its promise to pull qualified workers into germany . launched to a great fuss in 2000 , the program sought to bring in badly needed it specialists from eastern europe , india and russia to feed a booming industry .
that industry has all but collapsed , leaving a portion of the round 14,000 green card holders out of a job .
in munich , the home of one of the largest concentrations of green card holders , 7 percent had registered themselves as unemployed , according to a recent study . the situation fuels the arguments of christian democratic union politicians who say germany must do more to get the more than 4 million unemployed germans a job before focusing on bringing in immigrants . but economic experts are quick to point out that with every foreigner brought in , germans benefit . " they manage , through their special productive efficiency and willingness to be productive , to create more jobs , " said bernhard rohleder , of the it association , bitkom . in addition , they pay taxes , buy groceries and go out at night , contributing their share to keeping the german economy going , rohleder told deutsche welle .
the problem germany has is not bringing in enough of them . germany not very welcoming indeed , government officials hoped to have handed out 20,000 green cards by now .
but many candidates have been hesitant to go to a country where english is a second language and the nightly news carries reports on neo-nazi attacks on foreigners .
germany has n't done a good enough job of making the newcomers feel wanted , said christoph schmidt , president of the economic institute rwi . the usa and australia have no problem " bringing young people to their universities in order to … later integrate them as valuable members of the workforce , " schmidt said . the new immigration law foresaw more money and effort devoted to integrating foreigners already in germany . now , that money has been put on hold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.07.2003 foreign tech workers still wanted in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wanted 20,000 foreign it specialists .
it got less than that .
germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance . had chancellor gerhard schröder 's government gotten its way , germany 's first immigration law would already be attracting highly-qualified workers to the country . but germany 's constitutional court threw out the proposed law in december 2003 , one month before it was to take effect .
the court ruled that the way the law was passed in germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , was unconstitutional . in place of the law is the policy germany has had since it first invited guest workers into the country in the 1950s .
an addition to that policy , the green card program , was quietly extended this week .
the move by economic minister wolfgang clement shows the social democratic-green party coalition is holding fast to at least part of its promise to pull qualified workers into germany . launched to a great fuss in 2000 , the program sought to bring in badly needed it specialists from eastern europe , india and russia to feed a booming industry .
that industry has all but collapsed , leaving a portion of the round 14,000 green card holders out of a job .
in munich , the home of one of the largest concentrations of green card holders , 7 percent had registered themselves as unemployed , according to a recent study . the situation fuels the arguments of christian democratic union politicians who say germany must do more to get the more than 4 million unemployed germans a job before focusing on bringing in immigrants . but economic experts are quick to point out that with every foreigner brought in , germans benefit . " they manage , through their special productive efficiency and willingness to be productive , to create more jobs , " said bernhard rohleder , of the it association , bitkom . in addition , they pay taxes , buy groceries and go out at night , contributing their share to keeping the german economy going , rohleder told deutsche welle .
the problem germany has is not bringing in enough of them . germany not very welcoming indeed , government officials hoped to have handed out 20,000 green cards by now .
but many candidates have been hesitant to go to a country where english is a second language and the nightly news carries reports on neo-nazi attacks on foreigners .
germany has n't done a good enough job of making the newcomers feel wanted , said christoph schmidt , president of the economic institute rwi . the usa and australia have no problem " bringing young people to their universities in order to … later integrate them as valuable members of the workforce , " schmidt said . the new immigration law foresaw more money and effort devoted to integrating foreigners already in germany . now , that money has been put on hold .
earlier this month , the government asked a committee involving members of both houses of parliament to examine the proposed law again .
but serious negotiations are n't expected to take place until the fall . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows many german green card holders out of work with german unemployment creeping towards five million , a new study suggests that even many of the immigrant holders of the special it green card have lost their jobs .

the chancellor has enough of pasta ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder and his wife doris will be swapping the charms of the adriatic this year for the limited attractions of hanover .
the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .
" basta !
the chancellor has enough of pasta ! " screamed bild .
" ciao , bella italia ! "
the tabloid also printed a coupon , " fax this uncouth man out of office ! " , which readers could send to the italian embassy demanding the removal of italian deputy tourism minister stefano stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called german tourists " hypernationalistic , blond beach invaders , " earlier in the week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern league italian politician stefano stefani .
but unrestrained enthusiasm over the chancellor ’ s boycott of italy to spend his holiday was largely limited to the sensational bild .
though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .
" germans and their government should be self-confident enough to ignore the stupid comments of a subordinate italian politician , " business daily handelsblatt wrote .
" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that schröder ’ s move was making a mountain out of a molehill .
and even the local paper in schröder ’ s hometown hanover , where he will now spend his holiday , queried , " we were surprised that our chancellor took the words of any old junior minister so seriously .
hasn ’ t he overreacted ? "
holiday in rom , germany , rather than rome , italy ?
as fears grow among italy ’ s tourism industry of a possible fallout from the deepening diplomatic crisis -lrb- almost 10 million germans visit italy each year , spending more than eight billion euros -rrb- , the german chancellor has been flooded with offers for alternative holiday destinations .
kurt beck , state premier of rheinland-palatinate , invited schröder to rom , germany , rather than rome , italy .
" i have heard it said that rom in rheinland-palatinate is an idyllic , tranquil little place that is guaranteed to welcome outsiders , and where you can really relax , " beck said .
even pawel lewandowski , head of the polish tourist board , invited schröder and his family to visit poland ’ s version of " tuscany " instead .
" millions of germans have visited poland in past years and we can only confirm that they are always welcome as friendly , pleasant and open neighbors , " lewandowski said in an open letter to the chancellor .
" reciprocal visits contribute to reducing existing prejudices and helping europe grow together . "
similar offers poured in from austria , denmark and a clutch of local german hoteliers .
german-italian ties badly damaged ?
but the agonizing over where the german chancellor will spend his summer vacation aside , there are serious fears whether the german-italian relationship is on the rocks following a double set of insults hurled at germany last week .
gernot erler , a social democrat foreign policy expert , said in a radio interview the unfortunate italian comments could derail the european union and damage italy ’ s six-month eu presidency .
" it could lead to the whole european process , which really advanced in the last half year under greece ’ s excellent leadership , grinding to a halt .
that could also create a bad atmosphere which could even have economic consequences , " he said .
italian ambassador to germany silvio fagiolo rushed to allay fears that the ongoing row could have a negative effect on german-italian ties .
the ambassador said in a speech in berlin thursday that the two countries had too many things in common especially in european politics for ties to nosedive .
" neither of the two sides have indicated that it would negatively affect the diplomatic relationship , " he said .
meanwhile in italy ...
the repercussions of the snowballing crisis show no signs of dying down in italy .
tourism minister stefani finds himself in the eye of a diplomatic storm after making his derogatory comments on german tourists , saying they are " indoctrinated to feel top of the class whatever the situation . "
on friday opposition members of the conservative italian parliament called for his sacking for the " gravity , inappropriateness and irresponsibility of his statements . "
the liberal opposition said , " these statements have done grave damage to italy ’ s image , " while the governor of the italian region where schröder would have stayed compared stefani ’ s comments to a natural disaster .
" we intend to ask for political compensation for the serious damage inflicted on our region , " he said .
stefani , a member of the far-right northern league however has refused to apologize .

the chancellor has enough of pasta ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder and his wife doris will be swapping the charms of the adriatic this year for the limited attractions of hanover .
the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .
" basta !
the chancellor has enough of pasta ! " screamed bild .
" ciao , bella italia ! "
the tabloid also printed a coupon , " fax this uncouth man out of office ! " , which readers could send to the italian embassy demanding the removal of italian deputy tourism minister stefano stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called german tourists " hypernationalistic , blond beach invaders , " earlier in the week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern league italian politician stefano stefani .
but unrestrained enthusiasm over the chancellor ’ s boycott of italy to spend his holiday was largely limited to the sensational bild .
though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .
" germans and their government should be self-confident enough to ignore the stupid comments of a subordinate italian politician , " business daily handelsblatt wrote .
" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that schröder ’ s move was making a mountain out of a molehill .
and even the local paper in schröder ’ s hometown hanover , where he will now spend his holiday , queried , " we were surprised that our chancellor took the words of any old junior minister so seriously .

with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .
if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .
the alliance has been struggling to redefine its mission in the post-cold war era .

with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .

the chancellor has enough of pasta ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder and his wife doris will be swapping the charms of the adriatic this year for the limited attractions of hanover .
the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .
" basta !

" ciao , bella italia ! "
the tabloid also printed a coupon , " fax this uncouth man out of office ! " , which readers could send to the italian embassy demanding the removal of italian deputy tourism minister stefano stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called german tourists " hypernationalistic , blond beach invaders , " earlier in the week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern league italian politician stefano stefani .
but unrestrained enthusiasm over the chancellor ’ s boycott of italy to spend his holiday was largely limited to the sensational bild .
though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .
" germans and their government should be self-confident enough to ignore the stupid comments of a subordinate italian politician , " business daily handelsblatt wrote .
" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that schröder ’ s move was making a mountain out of a molehill .
and even the local paper in schröder ’ s hometown hanover , where he will now spend his holiday , queried , " we were surprised that our chancellor took the words of any old junior minister so seriously .
hasn ’ t he overreacted ? "
holiday in rom , germany , rather than rome , italy ?
as fears grow among italy ’ s tourism industry of a possible fallout from the deepening diplomatic crisis -lrb- almost 10 million germans visit italy each year , spending more than eight billion euros -rrb- , the german chancellor has been flooded with offers for alternative holiday destinations .
kurt beck , state premier of rheinland-palatinate , invited schröder to rom , germany , rather than rome , italy .
" i have heard it said that rom in rheinland-palatinate is an idyllic , tranquil little place that is guaranteed to welcome outsiders , and where you can really relax , " beck said .
even pawel lewandowski , head of the polish tourist board , invited schröder and his family to visit poland ’ s version of " tuscany " instead .
" millions of germans have visited poland in past years and we can only confirm that they are always welcome as friendly , pleasant and open neighbors , " lewandowski said in an open letter to the chancellor .
" reciprocal visits contribute to reducing existing prejudices and helping europe grow together . "
similar offers poured in from austria , denmark and a clutch of local german hoteliers .
german-italian ties badly damaged ?
but the agonizing over where the german chancellor will spend his summer vacation aside , there are serious fears whether the german-italian relationship is on the rocks following a double set of insults hurled at germany last week .
gernot erler , a social democrat foreign policy expert , said in a radio interview the unfortunate italian comments could derail the european union and damage italy ’ s six-month eu presidency .
" it could lead to the whole european process , which really advanced in the last half year under greece ’ s excellent leadership , grinding to a halt .
that could also create a bad atmosphere which could even have economic consequences , " he said .
italian ambassador to germany silvio fagiolo rushed to allay fears that the ongoing row could have a negative effect on german-italian ties .
the ambassador said in a speech in berlin thursday that the two countries had too many things in common especially in european politics for ties to nosedive .
" neither of the two sides have indicated that it would negatively affect the diplomatic relationship , " he said .
meanwhile in italy ...
the repercussions of the snowballing crisis show no signs of dying down in italy .
tourism minister stefani finds himself in the eye of a diplomatic storm after making his derogatory comments on german tourists , saying they are " indoctrinated to feel top of the class whatever the situation . "
on friday opposition members of the conservative italian parliament called for his sacking for the " gravity , inappropriateness and irresponsibility of his statements . "
the liberal opposition said , " these statements have done grave damage to italy ’ s image , " while the governor of the italian region where schröder would have stayed compared stefani ’ s comments to a natural disaster .
" we intend to ask for political compensation for the serious damage inflicted on our region , " he said .
stefani , a member of the far-right northern league however has refused to apologize .

the liberal opposition said , " these statements have done grave damage to italy ’ s image , " while the governor of the italian region where schröder would have stayed compared stefani ’ s comments to a natural disaster .
" we intend to ask for political compensation for the serious damage inflicted on our region , " he said .
stefani , a member of the far-right northern league however has refused to apologize .
" i don ’ t hold anything against the germans .
i had a german wife for 20 years , " he said .
" but on certain types of germans i haven ’ t changed my mind , " he added . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor says ciao italia 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .
if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .
the alliance has been struggling to redefine its mission in the post-cold war era .
next week , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to make his first trip to the united states since the war and some in government circles fear troop participation could become an issue , even though it 's not on the planned agenda . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris , warsaw try to heal iraq rift the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations .

with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .
if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .
the alliance has been struggling to redefine its mission in the post-cold war era .
next week , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to make his first trip to the united states since the war and some in government circles fear troop participation could become an issue , even though it 's not on the planned agenda . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris , warsaw try to heal iraq rift the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations .

but he added that bavaria would naturally “ want to have answers to a series of questions , ” for example , whether the product can be used safely without physicians ’ supervision . hagemann said the prescription committee had found no risks associated with selling the pill without a prescription . they also looked into the social advantages , he told the frankfurter allgemeine : “ reducing the number of abortions among teenagers is an important issue .

other countries where the pill is sold without prescriptions are france -lrb- where it is handed out by school nurses -rrb- , portugal , norway , sweden , finland , belgium , denmark and switzerland . the morning-after pill is based on the single hormone gestagen , and functions by preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus . it is not the same as the ru486 “ abortion pill , ” which causes a spontaneous miscarriage , and in fact will not terminate an already existent pregnancy . abortions among women between 15 and 18 years of age have risen in germany over the past six years , from 33 to 50 per 10,000 women . teenage pregnancies and the overall number of abortions have remained fairly stable . britain has the highest percentage of teen pregnancies in europe , 31 in 1,000 – more than twice as high as germany . only the united states ranks higher in industrial countries , with 52 in 1,000 women . while it is unclear whether having the morning-after pill available over the counter will actually slow the rate of teenage pregnancies and abortions , women ’ s rights and family-planning groups welcome the decision . “ it ’ s a great advantage because taking the pill is n't delayed by the necessity of visiting a doctor . international studies show that the pill is more effective the earlier it is taken , ” regine wlassitschau , of the german family-planning organization profamilia , told the frankfurter allgemeine .

but he added that bavaria would naturally “ want to have answers to a series of questions , ” for example , whether the product can be used safely without physicians ’ supervision . hagemann said the prescription committee had found no risks associated with selling the pill without a prescription . they also looked into the social advantages , he told the frankfurter allgemeine : “ reducing the number of abortions among teenagers is an important issue .
other countries have had positive experiences . ” available in schools the morning-after pill has been available without prescription in britain for women over 16 years since the beginning of 2001 .
other countries where the pill is sold without prescriptions are france -lrb- where it is handed out by school nurses -rrb- , portugal , norway , sweden , finland , belgium , denmark and switzerland . the morning-after pill is based on the single hormone gestagen , and functions by preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus . it is not the same as the ru486 “ abortion pill , ” which causes a spontaneous miscarriage , and in fact will not terminate an already existent pregnancy . abortions among women between 15 and 18 years of age have risen in germany over the past six years , from 33 to 50 per 10,000 women . teenage pregnancies and the overall number of abortions have remained fairly stable . britain has the highest percentage of teen pregnancies in europe , 31 in 1,000 – more than twice as high as germany . only the united states ranks higher in industrial countries , with 52 in 1,000 women . while it is unclear whether having the morning-after pill available over the counter will actually slow the rate of teenage pregnancies and abortions , women ’ s rights and family-planning groups welcome the decision . “ it ’ s a great advantage because taking the pill is n't delayed by the necessity of visiting a doctor . international studies show that the pill is more effective the earlier it is taken , ” regine wlassitschau , of the german family-planning organization profamilia , told the frankfurter allgemeine .

european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility . italian daily la repubblica wrote that three months after the fall of the saddam regime , u.s. president george w. bush had to admit there ’ s a " security issue " in iraq .
the paper said every day brought new reasons to worry : a pentagon report has revealed that fatigue and bad equipment led to the capture of u.s. soldier jessica lynch .
one marine shot himself north of baghdad , and the first troops that return home are complaining about " great stress " .
this climate of insecurity within the u.s. could even worsen , the paper warned , as the justification of the iraq invasion is at stake because of claims washington used false proofs to go to war .
the spanish daily el mundo agreed and said not even u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld thinks that the banned weapons which have triggered this war will be found .
in a senate hearing he confessed that the bush administration had taken action without having new or relevant proofs against saddam hussein , the paper wrote , suggesting that this has become a serious threat to the credibility of u.s. president george w. bush .
london-based daily the independent took a different view and argued that invading iraq nevertheless was the right thing to do : " the clearest and most compelling argument for the war was simply that the iraqi people wanted it to happen .
it was the only way they could see to end the tyranny of saddam " , the paper said .
that ’ s why it sees the morality of the war hinging on one simple question : " is iraq better or worse off now than under saddam ? "
der standard from austria suggested iraq could become a serious handicap for bush in the next presidential election campaign .
" the democrats will not miss any opportunity to put a spin on bush ’ s iraq mistakes with the american public .
the claim that the president lied could be especially dangerous , the paper pointed out , because who will believe the economic promises of a president who is known " not be one hundred percent strict about even the most sensitive national security information ? "
germany ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented on washington ’ s request to share the cost and responsibility of the iraq occupation with a coalition of countries , including france and germany .
yes , rumsfeld needs help , the paper stated .
but it warned that any satisfaction derived from it by the opponents of the iraq war should not go so far as to stop them from giving any assistance at all .
on the other hand , washington must understand that help has its price .
it can not distribute the burdens of occupation while at the same time keeping total control .

european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility . italian daily la repubblica wrote that three months after the fall of the saddam regime , u.s. president george w. bush had to admit there ’ s a " security issue " in iraq .
the paper said every day brought new reasons to worry : a pentagon report has revealed that fatigue and bad equipment led to the capture of u.s. soldier jessica lynch .
one marine shot himself north of baghdad , and the first troops that return home are complaining about " great stress " .
this climate of insecurity within the u.s. could even worsen , the paper warned , as the justification of the iraq invasion is at stake because of claims washington used false proofs to go to war .
the spanish daily el mundo agreed and said not even u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld thinks that the banned weapons which have triggered this war will be found .
in a senate hearing he confessed that the bush administration had taken action without having new or relevant proofs against saddam hussein , the paper wrote , suggesting that this has become a serious threat to the credibility of u.s. president george w. bush .
london-based daily the independent took a different view and argued that invading iraq nevertheless was the right thing to do : " the clearest and most compelling argument for the war was simply that the iraqi people wanted it to happen .
it was the only way they could see to end the tyranny of saddam " , the paper said .
that ’ s why it sees the morality of the war hinging on one simple question : " is iraq better or worse off now than under saddam ? "
der standard from austria suggested iraq could become a serious handicap for bush in the next presidential election campaign .
" the democrats will not miss any opportunity to put a spin on bush ’ s iraq mistakes with the american public .
the claim that the president lied could be especially dangerous , the paper pointed out , because who will believe the economic promises of a president who is known " not be one hundred percent strict about even the most sensitive national security information ? "
germany ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented on washington ’ s request to share the cost and responsibility of the iraq occupation with a coalition of countries , including france and germany .
yes , rumsfeld needs help , the paper stated .
but it warned that any satisfaction derived from it by the opponents of the iraq war should not go so far as to stop them from giving any assistance at all .
on the other hand , washington must understand that help has its price .
it can not distribute the burdens of occupation while at the same time keeping total control .

it got less than that .
germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance . had chancellor gerhard schröder 's government gotten its way , germany 's first immigration law would already be attracting highly-qualified workers to the country . but germany 's constitutional court threw out the proposed law in december 2003 , one month before it was to take effect .
the court ruled that the way the law was passed in germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , was unconstitutional . in place of the law is the policy germany has had since it first invited guest workers into the country in the 1950s .
an addition to that policy , the green card program , was quietly extended this week .
the move by economic minister wolfgang clement shows the social democratic-green party coalition is holding fast to at least part of its promise to pull qualified workers into germany . launched to a great fuss in 2000 , the program sought to bring in badly needed it specialists from eastern europe , india and russia to feed a booming industry .
that industry has all but collapsed , leaving a portion of the round 14,000 green card holders out of a job .
in munich , the home of one of the largest concentrations of green card holders , 7 percent had registered themselves as unemployed , according to a recent study . the situation fuels the arguments of christian democratic union politicians who say germany must do more to get the more than 4 million unemployed germans a job before focusing on bringing in immigrants . but economic experts are quick to point out that with every foreigner brought in , germans benefit . " they manage , through their special productive efficiency and willingness to be productive , to create more jobs , " said bernhard rohleder , of the it association , bitkom . in addition , they pay taxes , buy groceries and go out at night , contributing their share to keeping the german economy going , rohleder told deutsche welle .
the problem germany has is not bringing in enough of them . germany not very welcoming indeed , government officials hoped to have handed out 20,000 green cards by now .
but many candidates have been hesitant to go to a country where english is a second language and the nightly news carries reports on neo-nazi attacks on foreigners .
germany has n't done a good enough job of making the newcomers feel wanted , said christoph schmidt , president of the economic institute rwi . the usa and australia have no problem " bringing young people to their universities in order to … later integrate them as valuable members of the workforce , " schmidt said . the new immigration law foresaw more money and effort devoted to integrating foreigners already in germany . now , that money has been put on hold .

the chancellor has enough of pasta ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder and his wife doris will be swapping the charms of the adriatic this year for the limited attractions of hanover .
the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .
" basta !
the chancellor has enough of pasta ! " screamed bild .
" ciao , bella italia ! "
the tabloid also printed a coupon , " fax this uncouth man out of office ! " , which readers could send to the italian embassy demanding the removal of italian deputy tourism minister stefano stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called german tourists " hypernationalistic , blond beach invaders , " earlier in the week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern league italian politician stefano stefani .
but unrestrained enthusiasm over the chancellor ’ s boycott of italy to spend his holiday was largely limited to the sensational bild .
though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .
" germans and their government should be self-confident enough to ignore the stupid comments of a subordinate italian politician , " business daily handelsblatt wrote .
" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that schröder ’ s move was making a mountain out of a molehill .
and even the local paper in schröder ’ s hometown hanover , where he will now spend his holiday , queried , " we were surprised that our chancellor took the words of any old junior minister so seriously .
hasn ’ t he overreacted ? "
holiday in rom , germany , rather than rome , italy ?
as fears grow among italy ’ s tourism industry of a possible fallout from the deepening diplomatic crisis -lrb- almost 10 million germans visit italy each year , spending more than eight billion euros -rrb- , the german chancellor has been flooded with offers for alternative holiday destinations .
kurt beck , state premier of rheinland-palatinate , invited schröder to rom , germany , rather than rome , italy .
" i have heard it said that rom in rheinland-palatinate is an idyllic , tranquil little place that is guaranteed to welcome outsiders , and where you can really relax , " beck said .
even pawel lewandowski , head of the polish tourist board , invited schröder and his family to visit poland ’ s version of " tuscany " instead .
" millions of germans have visited poland in past years and we can only confirm that they are always welcome as friendly , pleasant and open neighbors , " lewandowski said in an open letter to the chancellor .
" reciprocal visits contribute to reducing existing prejudices and helping europe grow together . "
similar offers poured in from austria , denmark and a clutch of local german hoteliers .
german-italian ties badly damaged ?
but the agonizing over where the german chancellor will spend his summer vacation aside , there are serious fears whether the german-italian relationship is on the rocks following a double set of insults hurled at germany last week .
gernot erler , a social democrat foreign policy expert , said in a radio interview the unfortunate italian comments could derail the european union and damage italy ’ s six-month eu presidency .
" it could lead to the whole european process , which really advanced in the last half year under greece ’ s excellent leadership , grinding to a halt .
that could also create a bad atmosphere which could even have economic consequences , " he said .
italian ambassador to germany silvio fagiolo rushed to allay fears that the ongoing row could have a negative effect on german-italian ties .
the ambassador said in a speech in berlin thursday that the two countries had too many things in common especially in european politics for ties to nosedive .
" neither of the two sides have indicated that it would negatively affect the diplomatic relationship , " he said .
meanwhile in italy ...
the repercussions of the snowballing crisis show no signs of dying down in italy .
tourism minister stefani finds himself in the eye of a diplomatic storm after making his derogatory comments on german tourists , saying they are " indoctrinated to feel top of the class whatever the situation . "
on friday opposition members of the conservative italian parliament called for his sacking for the " gravity , inappropriateness and irresponsibility of his statements . "
the liberal opposition said , " these statements have done grave damage to italy ’ s image , " while the governor of the italian region where schröder would have stayed compared stefani ’ s comments to a natural disaster .
" we intend to ask for political compensation for the serious damage inflicted on our region , " he said .
stefani , a member of the far-right northern league however has refused to apologize .
" i don ’ t hold anything against the germans .
i had a german wife for 20 years , " he said .
" but on certain types of germans i haven ’ t changed my mind , " he added . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor says ciao italia 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but he added that bavaria would naturally “ want to have answers to a series of questions , ” for example , whether the product can be used safely without physicians ’ supervision . hagemann said the prescription committee had found no risks associated with selling the pill without a prescription . they also looked into the social advantages , he told the frankfurter allgemeine : “ reducing the number of abortions among teenagers is an important issue .
other countries have had positive experiences . ” available in schools the morning-after pill has been available without prescription in britain for women over 16 years since the beginning of 2001 .
other countries where the pill is sold without prescriptions are france -lrb- where it is handed out by school nurses -rrb- , portugal , norway , sweden , finland , belgium , denmark and switzerland . the morning-after pill is based on the single hormone gestagen , and functions by preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus . it is not the same as the ru486 “ abortion pill , ” which causes a spontaneous miscarriage , and in fact will not terminate an already existent pregnancy . abortions among women between 15 and 18 years of age have risen in germany over the past six years , from 33 to 50 per 10,000 women . teenage pregnancies and the overall number of abortions have remained fairly stable . britain has the highest percentage of teen pregnancies in europe , 31 in 1,000 – more than twice as high as germany . only the united states ranks higher in industrial countries , with 52 in 1,000 women . while it is unclear whether having the morning-after pill available over the counter will actually slow the rate of teenage pregnancies and abortions , women ’ s rights and family-planning groups welcome the decision . “ it ’ s a great advantage because taking the pill is n't delayed by the necessity of visiting a doctor . international studies show that the pill is more effective the earlier it is taken , ” regine wlassitschau , of the german family-planning organization profamilia , told the frankfurter allgemeine .

" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .
" germans and their government should be self-confident enough to ignore the stupid comments of a subordinate italian politician , " business daily handelsblatt wrote .
" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that schröder ’ s move was making a mountain out of a molehill .
and even the local paper in schröder ’ s hometown hanover , where he will now spend his holiday , queried , " we were surprised that our chancellor took the words of any old junior minister so seriously .
hasn ’ t he overreacted ? "
holiday in rom , germany , rather than rome , italy ?
as fears grow among italy ’ s tourism industry of a possible fallout from the deepening diplomatic crisis -lrb- almost 10 million germans visit italy each year , spending more than eight billion euros -rrb- , the german chancellor has been flooded with offers for alternative holiday destinations .
kurt beck , state premier of rheinland-palatinate , invited schröder to rom , germany , rather than rome , italy .
" i have heard it said that rom in rheinland-palatinate is an idyllic , tranquil little place that is guaranteed to welcome outsiders , and where you can really relax , " beck said .
even pawel lewandowski , head of the polish tourist board , invited schröder and his family to visit poland ’ s version of " tuscany " instead .
" millions of germans have visited poland in past years and we can only confirm that they are always welcome as friendly , pleasant and open neighbors , " lewandowski said in an open letter to the chancellor .
" reciprocal visits contribute to reducing existing prejudices and helping europe grow together . "
similar offers poured in from austria , denmark and a clutch of local german hoteliers .
german-italian ties badly damaged ?
but the agonizing over where the german chancellor will spend his summer vacation aside , there are serious fears whether the german-italian relationship is on the rocks following a double set of insults hurled at germany last week .
gernot erler , a social democrat foreign policy expert , said in a radio interview the unfortunate italian comments could derail the european union and damage italy ’ s six-month eu presidency .
" it could lead to the whole european process , which really advanced in the last half year under greece ’ s excellent leadership , grinding to a halt .
that could also create a bad atmosphere which could even have economic consequences , " he said .
italian ambassador to germany silvio fagiolo rushed to allay fears that the ongoing row could have a negative effect on german-italian ties .
the ambassador said in a speech in berlin thursday that the two countries had too many things in common especially in european politics for ties to nosedive .
" neither of the two sides have indicated that it would negatively affect the diplomatic relationship , " he said .
meanwhile in italy ...
the repercussions of the snowballing crisis show no signs of dying down in italy .
tourism minister stefani finds himself in the eye of a diplomatic storm after making his derogatory comments on german tourists , saying they are " indoctrinated to feel top of the class whatever the situation . "
on friday opposition members of the conservative italian parliament called for his sacking for the " gravity , inappropriateness and irresponsibility of his statements . "
the liberal opposition said , " these statements have done grave damage to italy ’ s image , " while the governor of the italian region where schröder would have stayed compared stefani ’ s comments to a natural disaster .

the chancellor has enough of pasta ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder and his wife doris will be swapping the charms of the adriatic this year for the limited attractions of hanover .
the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .
" basta !
the chancellor has enough of pasta ! " screamed bild .
" ciao , bella italia ! "
the tabloid also printed a coupon , " fax this uncouth man out of office ! " , which readers could send to the italian embassy demanding the removal of italian deputy tourism minister stefano stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called german tourists " hypernationalistic , blond beach invaders , " earlier in the week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern league italian politician stefano stefani .
but unrestrained enthusiasm over the chancellor ’ s boycott of italy to spend his holiday was largely limited to the sensational bild .
though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .

" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "

european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility . italian daily la repubblica wrote that three months after the fall of the saddam regime , u.s. president george w. bush had to admit there ’ s a " security issue " in iraq .
the paper said every day brought new reasons to worry : a pentagon report has revealed that fatigue and bad equipment led to the capture of u.s. soldier jessica lynch .
one marine shot himself north of baghdad , and the first troops that return home are complaining about " great stress " .
this climate of insecurity within the u.s. could even worsen , the paper warned , as the justification of the iraq invasion is at stake because of claims washington used false proofs to go to war .
the spanish daily el mundo agreed and said not even u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld thinks that the banned weapons which have triggered this war will be found .
in a senate hearing he confessed that the bush administration had taken action without having new or relevant proofs against saddam hussein , the paper wrote , suggesting that this has become a serious threat to the credibility of u.s. president george w. bush .
london-based daily the independent took a different view and argued that invading iraq nevertheless was the right thing to do : " the clearest and most compelling argument for the war was simply that the iraqi people wanted it to happen .
it was the only way they could see to end the tyranny of saddam " , the paper said .
that ’ s why it sees the morality of the war hinging on one simple question : " is iraq better or worse off now than under saddam ? "
der standard from austria suggested iraq could become a serious handicap for bush in the next presidential election campaign .
" the democrats will not miss any opportunity to put a spin on bush ’ s iraq mistakes with the american public .
the claim that the president lied could be especially dangerous , the paper pointed out , because who will believe the economic promises of a president who is known " not be one hundred percent strict about even the most sensitive national security information ? "
germany ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented on washington ’ s request to share the cost and responsibility of the iraq occupation with a coalition of countries , including france and germany .
yes , rumsfeld needs help , the paper stated .
but it warned that any satisfaction derived from it by the opponents of the iraq war should not go so far as to stop them from giving any assistance at all .
on the other hand , washington must understand that help has its price .

european papers on friday focused on the increasingly risk-fraught attempt by the americans to restore order in postwar iraq and the erosion of president bush 's credibility . italian daily la repubblica wrote that three months after the fall of the saddam regime , u.s. president george w. bush had to admit there ’ s a " security issue " in iraq .
the paper said every day brought new reasons to worry : a pentagon report has revealed that fatigue and bad equipment led to the capture of u.s. soldier jessica lynch .
one marine shot himself north of baghdad , and the first troops that return home are complaining about " great stress " .
this climate of insecurity within the u.s. could even worsen , the paper warned , as the justification of the iraq invasion is at stake because of claims washington used false proofs to go to war .
the spanish daily el mundo agreed and said not even u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld thinks that the banned weapons which have triggered this war will be found .
in a senate hearing he confessed that the bush administration had taken action without having new or relevant proofs against saddam hussein , the paper wrote , suggesting that this has become a serious threat to the credibility of u.s. president george w. bush .
london-based daily the independent took a different view and argued that invading iraq nevertheless was the right thing to do : " the clearest and most compelling argument for the war was simply that the iraqi people wanted it to happen .
it was the only way they could see to end the tyranny of saddam " , the paper said .
that ’ s why it sees the morality of the war hinging on one simple question : " is iraq better or worse off now than under saddam ? "
der standard from austria suggested iraq could become a serious handicap for bush in the next presidential election campaign .
" the democrats will not miss any opportunity to put a spin on bush ’ s iraq mistakes with the american public .
the claim that the president lied could be especially dangerous , the paper pointed out , because who will believe the economic promises of a president who is known " not be one hundred percent strict about even the most sensitive national security information ? "
germany ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented on washington ’ s request to share the cost and responsibility of the iraq occupation with a coalition of countries , including france and germany .
yes , rumsfeld needs help , the paper stated .
but it warned that any satisfaction derived from it by the opponents of the iraq war should not go so far as to stop them from giving any assistance at all .
on the other hand , washington must understand that help has its price .
it can not distribute the burdens of occupation while at the same time keeping total control .
anyone who joins , must also be given a say , the paper said concluding : " it seems that the united nations could get their chance in iraq at last . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2003 u.s. expected to ask germany , france to send troops to iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. says it will need help bringing iraq under control .
with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .
if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .
the alliance has been struggling to redefine its mission in the post-cold war era .
next week , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to make his first trip to the united states since the war and some in government circles fear troop participation could become an issue , even though it 's not on the planned agenda . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris , warsaw try to heal iraq rift the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations .

with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .
if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .
the alliance has been struggling to redefine its mission in the post-cold war era .
next week , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to make his first trip to the united states since the war and some in government circles fear troop participation could become an issue , even though it 's not on the planned agenda . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris , warsaw try to heal iraq rift the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations .

it got less than that .
germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance . had chancellor gerhard schröder 's government gotten its way , germany 's first immigration law would already be attracting highly-qualified workers to the country . but germany 's constitutional court threw out the proposed law in december 2003 , one month before it was to take effect .
the court ruled that the way the law was passed in germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , was unconstitutional . in place of the law is the policy germany has had since it first invited guest workers into the country in the 1950s .
an addition to that policy , the green card program , was quietly extended this week .
the move by economic minister wolfgang clement shows the social democratic-green party coalition is holding fast to at least part of its promise to pull qualified workers into germany . launched to a great fuss in 2000 , the program sought to bring in badly needed it specialists from eastern europe , india and russia to feed a booming industry .
that industry has all but collapsed , leaving a portion of the round 14,000 green card holders out of a job .
in munich , the home of one of the largest concentrations of green card holders , 7 percent had registered themselves as unemployed , according to a recent study . the situation fuels the arguments of christian democratic union politicians who say germany must do more to get the more than 4 million unemployed germans a job before focusing on bringing in immigrants . but economic experts are quick to point out that with every foreigner brought in , germans benefit . " they manage , through their special productive efficiency and willingness to be productive , to create more jobs , " said bernhard rohleder , of the it association , bitkom . in addition , they pay taxes , buy groceries and go out at night , contributing their share to keeping the german economy going , rohleder told deutsche welle .
the problem germany has is not bringing in enough of them . germany not very welcoming indeed , government officials hoped to have handed out 20,000 green cards by now .
but many candidates have been hesitant to go to a country where english is a second language and the nightly news carries reports on neo-nazi attacks on foreigners .

but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .
if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .
the alliance has been struggling to redefine its mission in the post-cold war era .
next week , german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected to make his first trip to the united states since the war and some in government circles fear troop participation could become an issue , even though it 's not on the planned agenda . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , paris , warsaw try to heal iraq rift the leaders of france , germany and poland agreed to disagree over the iraq war at the weimar triangle summit on friday , but vowed not to let their differences jeopardize relations .

the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .

though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .

as fears grow among italy ’ s tourism industry of a possible fallout from the deepening diplomatic crisis -lrb- almost 10 million germans visit italy each year , spending more than eight billion euros -rrb- , the german chancellor has been flooded with offers for alternative holiday destinations .
kurt beck , state premier of rheinland-palatinate , invited schröder to rom , germany , rather than rome , italy .
" i have heard it said that rom in rheinland-palatinate is an idyllic , tranquil little place that is guaranteed to welcome outsiders , and where you can really relax , " beck said .
even pawel lewandowski , head of the polish tourist board , invited schröder and his family to visit poland ’ s version of " tuscany " instead .
" millions of germans have visited poland in past years and we can only confirm that they are always welcome as friendly , pleasant and open neighbors , " lewandowski said in an open letter to the chancellor .
" reciprocal visits contribute to reducing existing prejudices and helping europe grow together . "
similar offers poured in from austria , denmark and a clutch of local german hoteliers .

it got less than that .
germany this week extended its " green card " program to skilled immigrants .
the move comes at a time when the country 's immigration policy hangs in the balance . had chancellor gerhard schröder 's government gotten its way , germany 's first immigration law would already be attracting highly-qualified workers to the country . but germany 's constitutional court threw out the proposed law in december 2003 , one month before it was to take effect .
the court ruled that the way the law was passed in germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , was unconstitutional . in place of the law is the policy germany has had since it first invited guest workers into the country in the 1950s .
an addition to that policy , the green card program , was quietly extended this week .
the move by economic minister wolfgang clement shows the social democratic-green party coalition is holding fast to at least part of its promise to pull qualified workers into germany . launched to a great fuss in 2000 , the program sought to bring in badly needed it specialists from eastern europe , india and russia to feed a booming industry .
that industry has all but collapsed , leaving a portion of the round 14,000 green card holders out of a job .
in munich , the home of one of the largest concentrations of green card holders , 7 percent had registered themselves as unemployed , according to a recent study . the situation fuels the arguments of christian democratic union politicians who say germany must do more to get the more than 4 million unemployed germans a job before focusing on bringing in immigrants . but economic experts are quick to point out that with every foreigner brought in , germans benefit . " they manage , through their special productive efficiency and willingness to be productive , to create more jobs , " said bernhard rohleder , of the it association , bitkom . in addition , they pay taxes , buy groceries and go out at night , contributing their share to keeping the german economy going , rohleder told deutsche welle .
the problem germany has is not bringing in enough of them . germany not very welcoming indeed , government officials hoped to have handed out 20,000 green cards by now .
but many candidates have been hesitant to go to a country where english is a second language and the nightly news carries reports on neo-nazi attacks on foreigners .

with the u.s. senate poised to request nato troops to stabilize security in iraq , the german and french governments are expecting to be asked to send their own soldiers , despite their opposition to the war . following thursday 's unanimous decision by the united states senate to request nato support for its occupation of iraq , germany and france are expected to receive official requests for troops .
but officials in both france and germany have said they would oppose even considering sending troops without a united nations mandate .
a spokesman for the german defense ministry confirmed his ministry 's stance to deutsche welle on thrusday .
the latest diplomatic negotiations come against a backdrop of rising violence and instability in iraq .
every day , new reports come out of attacks against u.s. soldiers .
a total of 31 have been killed since u.s. president george w. bush announced the end of the main fighting in iraq in may .
reports also indicate that morale among the 146,000 u.s. soldiers currently stationed in iraq is plunging .
the u.s. government also admitted this week that costs have increased dramatically – rising from approximately $ 2 billion a month in april , taxpayers were told they would have to spend to $ 3.9 billion a month now .
on wednesday and thursday , u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld spent two days before the senate answering questions about operation iraqi freedom and the recent spiral of violence .
retired u.s. general tommy franks said the country should expect to have troops stationed in iraq for as long as four years .
" i anticipate we 'll be involved in iraq in the future , " franks told the house armed services committee thursday .
" whether that means two years or four years , i do n't know . "
sharing the burden with rising costs and an increasing number of deaths among american and british soldiers , u.s. politicians are now keen to share the burden with other countries .
on thursday , the senate voted 97-0 to request that the president " consider requesting formally and expeditiously that nato raise a force for deployment in post-war iraq similar to what it has done in afghanistan , bosnia and kosovo . "
currently polish , italian and spanish troops are on the ground alongside american and british soldiers in iraq , but those countries , despite their nato membership , are not participating in the occupying forces under the auspices of nato .
now , a number of u.s. politicians want to expand that roster of countries .
democratic senator john kerry , who is a candidate for the u.s. presidency , said it was time to bring the international community into the rebuilding and security effort in iraq .
" it is time for the president to tell the truth that we lack sufficient forces to do the job of reconstruction in iraq and withdraw in a reasonable time , " kerry said .
" america should not go it alone . "
the discussion came after rumsfeld on wednesday said he wanted to make a request to nato members to send troops to iraq to support the u.s. and british soldiers already stationed there .
as nato members , germany and france – the most vocal opponents of the war in iraq – are likely to be among those asked to aid in those efforts .
" our goal is to get large numbers of international forces in from lots of countries , including those two , " rumsfeld said on tuesday .
trouble for berlin but the request could throw the government of chancellor gerhard schröder into a crisis .
if the request comes , the government would be faced with two choices : it could offer its support and send german nato troops to iraq or it could contribute financially to the immense costs of democratizing the country .
it 's unlikely germany will send troops to iraq considering that the bundeswehr has already been stretched to its limits with other peacekeeping operations .
it currently has over 8,000 german soldiers deployed on foreign missions - mostly in afghanistan and in the balkans region .
with an anticipated € 30 billion shortfall in its 2004 fiscal budget , it is also unlikely germany will be able to contribute much by way of checkbook diplomacy .
unnamed german government sources told deutsche welle on thursday that the idea of germany sending peacekeeping troops to iraq is n't even a subject for debate at this point .
meanwhile , french foreign minister dominique de villepin has said that french soldiers would only be deployed at the request of the united nations .
if nato does submit official requests to germany and france , and they are rejected , it would once again portray nato as a divided alliance .
in february , germany , france and belgium launched one of the worst crises in nato 's 53-year history after they intially vetoed a u.s. request to begin planning to defend turkey if iraq launched an attack on its neighbor response to a u.s. invasion .
the countries maintained that such preparations would suggest war against iraq was inevitable .
eventually , the three agreed to change their positions , but the event demonstrated a level of discord that threatened the future of nato .
the alliance has been struggling to redefine its mission in the post-cold war era .

the chancellor has enough of pasta ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder and his wife doris will be swapping the charms of the adriatic this year for the limited attractions of hanover .
the chancellor 's scrapping of his italian holiday following insulting remarks by an italian minister earned him plaudits as well as criticism , but fears remain whether diplomatic ties can weather the current crisis . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s cancellation of his holiday to the adriatic coast in italy was greeted with hoops of joy by germany ’ s largest-selling daily bild on thursday .
" basta !
the chancellor has enough of pasta ! " screamed bild .
" ciao , bella italia ! "
the tabloid also printed a coupon , " fax this uncouth man out of office ! " , which readers could send to the italian embassy demanding the removal of italian deputy tourism minister stefano stefani -lrb- photo -rrb- , who called german tourists " hypernationalistic , blond beach invaders , " earlier in the week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern league italian politician stefano stefani .
but unrestrained enthusiasm over the chancellor ’ s boycott of italy to spend his holiday was largely limited to the sensational bild .
though the paper cited a survey by national pollsters emnid which showed that 14 percent of germans would avoid italian restaurants after italian premier berlusconi ’ s controversial nazi slur last week , several commentators , politicians and media alike likened the chancellor ’ s move to a populist gimmick and said it merely confirmed anti-german stereotypes .
" irresponsible populism " and " overreaction " elmar brok , a representative of the opposition christian democrats at the eu forum drawing up a new constitution , accused schröder of damaging ties with rome just as his anti-war stance had done earlier in the year with washington .
brock accused schröder of " irresponsible populism . "
" even if individual politicians talk nonsense , nations should not be brought against each other , " he said .
michael kahn-ackermann , head of the goethe institut in rome told reuters , " we germans here in italy would have liked politicians to have reacted with more of a sense of humor , if only to counter the prejudice that germans are boring . "
similar views were echoed in several of germany ’ s leading newspapers .
" germans and their government should be self-confident enough to ignore the stupid comments of a subordinate italian politician , " business daily handelsblatt wrote .
" something like this should not happen between two states which cooperate so closely in the eu and the single currency . "
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung commented that schröder ’ s move was making a mountain out of a molehill .
and even the local paper in schröder ’ s hometown hanover , where he will now spend his holiday , queried , " we were surprised that our chancellor took the words of any old junior minister so seriously .
hasn ’ t he overreacted ? "
holiday in rom , germany , rather than rome , italy ?
as fears grow among italy ’ s tourism industry of a possible fallout from the deepening diplomatic crisis -lrb- almost 10 million germans visit italy each year , spending more than eight billion euros -rrb- , the german chancellor has been flooded with offers for alternative holiday destinations .
kurt beck , state premier of rheinland-palatinate , invited schröder to rom , germany , rather than rome , italy .
" i have heard it said that rom in rheinland-palatinate is an idyllic , tranquil little place that is guaranteed to welcome outsiders , and where you can really relax , " beck said .
even pawel lewandowski , head of the polish tourist board , invited schröder and his family to visit poland ’ s version of " tuscany " instead .
" millions of germans have visited poland in past years and we can only confirm that they are always welcome as friendly , pleasant and open neighbors , " lewandowski said in an open letter to the chancellor .
" reciprocal visits contribute to reducing existing prejudices and helping europe grow together . "
similar offers poured in from austria , denmark and a clutch of local german hoteliers .
german-italian ties badly damaged ?
but the agonizing over where the german chancellor will spend his summer vacation aside , there are serious fears whether the german-italian relationship is on the rocks following a double set of insults hurled at germany last week .
gernot erler , a social democrat foreign policy expert , said in a radio interview the unfortunate italian comments could derail the european union and damage italy ’ s six-month eu presidency .
" it could lead to the whole european process , which really advanced in the last half year under greece ’ s excellent leadership , grinding to a halt .
that could also create a bad atmosphere which could even have economic consequences , " he said .
italian ambassador to germany silvio fagiolo rushed to allay fears that the ongoing row could have a negative effect on german-italian ties .
the ambassador said in a speech in berlin thursday that the two countries had too many things in common especially in european politics for ties to nosedive .
" neither of the two sides have indicated that it would negatively affect the diplomatic relationship , " he said .
meanwhile in italy ...
the repercussions of the snowballing crisis show no signs of dying down in italy .
tourism minister stefani finds himself in the eye of a diplomatic storm after making his derogatory comments on german tourists , saying they are " indoctrinated to feel top of the class whatever the situation . "
on friday opposition members of the conservative italian parliament called for his sacking for the " gravity , inappropriateness and irresponsibility of his statements . "
the liberal opposition said , " these statements have done grave damage to italy ’ s image , " while the governor of the italian region where schröder would have stayed compared stefani ’ s comments to a natural disaster .
" we intend to ask for political compensation for the serious damage inflicted on our region , " he said .
stefani , a member of the far-right northern league however has refused to apologize .
" i don ’ t hold anything against the germans .
i had a german wife for 20 years , " he said .
" but on certain types of germans i haven ’ t changed my mind , " he added . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor says ciao italia 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" the ball is not in my court right now , " he said .
" the ball is in the court of west africa and the international forces .
as soon as they get here , there should be no reason for me to tarry . "
bush 's decision president bush will be ready to decide within days whether to send peacekeepers , colin powell told reporters .
" i expect that over the next several days ... the president will be in a position to make a decision , " he told reporters covering the president 's trip to africa .

he told the bbc that american troops would face no danger in liberia .
in a separate interview , the embattled president said he would not leave office until international peacekeepers were on the ground .
us secretary of state colin powell said on thursday that president george w bush would be ready to make a decision on sending troops within days .
he emphasised that the role of american soldiers would be very limited in duration and scope .
the bbc 's matt frei says the us clearly does not want its troops to get bogged down in another crisis and so west africa will have to take the lead .
liberia 's government and the rebels have stopped fighting but the truce may collapse if troops do not arrive soon , the bbc 's paul welsh reports from the capital , monrovia .
west african peacekeepers are not expected for two weeks and may actually take much longer to arrive .
safety guarantee charles taylor said american troops need not fear another somalia - where their last peacekeeping operation in africa left many american soldiers dead .
" america owes it to liberia ... "
mr taylor told the bbc .
as soon as -lsb- peacekeepers -rsb- get here , there should be no reason for me to tarry charles taylor " do not be afraid about american boys getting hurt in liberia .
i can guarantee no matter where i am that liberians will never fire a pistol at an american soldier here because we want them here , because we feel left out . "
he also told the bbc that his downfall had been masterminded by the british and american governments since before he was elected .
in an interview for reuters news agency , mr taylor , who has already accepted an offer of asylum in nigeria , also made clear that his own presence in liberia was tied to the arrival of peacekeepers .
" the ball is not in my court right now , " he said .
" the ball is in the court of west africa and the international forces .
as soon as they get here , there should be no reason for me to tarry . "
bush 's decision president bush will be ready to decide within days whether to send peacekeepers , colin powell told reporters .
liberians are desperate for an end to over a decade of conflict in pictures " i expect that over the next several days ... the president will be in a position to make a decision , " he told reporters covering the president 's trip to africa .
hundreds of liberians gathered in pounding rain at an airfield near monrovia on wednesday to greet the us military team now assessing the situation on the ground .
the crowd of mostly women and children chanted " we want peace " as the team arrived .
the americans were tasked with visiting the airfield , the port and monrovia 's main hospital .
meanwhile , a united nations agency has warned that thousands of displaced people , living in camps around monrovia , will soon face starvation unless supplies can reach them .
world food programme spokesman arnold vercken says it has trucks ready to take them food but that it is too dangerous to make the deliveries .

the findings of doctors at a glasgow hospital are published in this week 's edition of the medical journal the lancet .
the research was carried out by david george and colleagues at the western infirmary .
they looked at the treatment of 1,700 women in the uk , australia and new zealand after they were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ -lrb- dcis -rrb- .
this is early breast cancer , where the cancer cells are contained within the milk ducts and have not spread into the surrounding tissue .
breast screening has led to an increasing diagnosis of the condition , which is almost always completely cured .
too drastic however , the treatment has been the subject of controversy .
mastectomy is often considered to be too drastic for dcis , but some believe it is not enough to remove the duct without additional treatment .
mr george and his colleagues investigated whether additional treatment with radiotherapy , medication or a combination of both could reduce recurrence of breast cancer after surgery . "
many surgeons , especially in the uk , think that radiotherapy is not required if the disease is completely removed in surgery " joan houghton co-author they said that radiotherapy after surgery reduced the relative risk of recurrence in the same breast by more than 60 % .
it also cut the overall relative risk of invasive cancer in the same breast by more than half .
the use of anti-oestrogen drug tamoxifen led to a 30 % fall in the risk of dcis recurring , but had no effect in reducing the risk of invasive cancer in the same breast .
neither treatment had any effect on the cancer risk in the other breast .
co-author joan houghton said : " these results are important because many surgeons , especially in the uk , think that radiotherapy is not required if the disease is completely removed in surgery .
" however , we will have to await the results of our more detailed study of the pathological characteristics of the removed tissues before we can confirm that radiotherapy is useful for all patients . "

the findings of doctors at a glasgow hospital are published in this week 's edition of the medical journal the lancet .
the research was carried out by david george and colleagues at the western infirmary .
they looked at the treatment of 1,700 women in the uk , australia and new zealand after they were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ -lrb- dcis -rrb- .
this is early breast cancer , where the cancer cells are contained within the milk ducts and have not spread into the surrounding tissue .
breast screening has led to an increasing diagnosis of the condition , which is almost always completely cured .
too drastic however , the treatment has been the subject of controversy .
mastectomy is often considered to be too drastic for dcis , but some believe it is not enough to remove the duct without additional treatment .
mr george and his colleagues investigated whether additional treatment with radiotherapy , medication or a combination of both could reduce recurrence of breast cancer after surgery .
many surgeons , especially in the uk , think that radiotherapy is not required if the disease is completely removed in surgery joan houghton co-author they said that radiotherapy after surgery reduced the relative risk of recurrence in the same breast by more than 60 % .
it also cut the overall relative risk of invasive cancer in the same breast by more than half .
the use of anti-oestrogen drug tamoxifen led to a 30 % fall in the risk of dcis recurring , but had no effect in reducing the risk of invasive cancer in the same breast .
neither treatment had any effect on the cancer risk in the other breast .
co-author joan houghton said : " these results are important because many surgeons , especially in the uk , think that radiotherapy is not required if the disease is completely removed in surgery .

they are adding their voice to a welsh assembly report which calls for everyone to ease the strain on the nhs by making more of an effort to stay healthy .
the review of health and social care in wales claims the nhs will not be able to cope unless there is a " step-change " in the way individuals and communities accept responsibility for their lifestyle .
richard lewis , a gp and secretary of the british medical association in wales , said ridding schools of vending machines with sugary drinks and sweets was a good way to drive home that message to the adults of tomorrow .
you ca n't just leave it to the doctors tony beddow , welsh institute for health and social care he said : " we 're asking that , where snacks and drinks need to be made available , the healthy options need to be balanced with the unhealthy options .
" children do need access to something to drink during the day , and i think a number of schools do provide non-detrimental alternatives such as bottled water .
" very often children follow a learned behaviour from their family - those are the role models they tend to follow .
" in order to empower patients to adopt healthy lifestyles and healthy living , that education has to start at school . "
food for thought : not eating this could help the nhs in wales " it 's very much common sense stuff - healthy eating , plenty of fresh fruit in your diet and a sensible exercise regime .
the nhs in wales is struggling to cope with the rise in obesity cases and it is feared that , in 15 years ' time , a third of the population could be obese .
the assembly-commissioned report said the public needed to do much more to relieve the burden on the service , which faces collapse without major reform .
derek wanless , the former chief executive of natwest bank , was the report adviser .
" no amount of effort by the health and care services can be a substitute for this , " he said .
he called for " policy action to raise public awareness " of how people can look after their own health .
health service analyst tony beddow , senior fellow at the welsh institute for health and social care , said the document , published by health secretary jane hutt on wednesday , reflected the view of many health professionals .
doctors : people should not leave their health just to the experts mr beddow , a former chief executive of a welsh health authority , said : " you ca n't just leave it to the doctors . "
" we have a responsibility to our own health .
" smoking , diet and exercise are the obvious things but alcohol , violence and drugs misuse are also coming up the agenda . "

more than 1,000 households in swaffham , norfolk , will be able to use the environmentally friendly electricity when the 85-metre-tall turbine is operational .
engineers and staff from ecotricity , the firm behind the turbine scheme , have used three huge cranes to put sections of the turbine 's tower together .

" this is what it is all about - creating clean energy sources .
" people across the country can choose to switch their supply and power their homes with green electricity at the same price as their local supplier . "
when it is complete , the turbine will generate enough power for more than 1,200 homes .
combined with the existing turbine put up in 1999 , it will supply 75 % of swaffham 's total home electricity requirements , boosting norfolk 's total wind power by 30 % .
mr vince said the new turbine , built following demands from local people after the success of the first , would be producing locally generated power within two weeks .

components have been delivered to the site from all over europe .
it is the second turbine to be built by the company in swaffham .
people see wind power as a serious solution to our need for energy dale vince , managing director of ecotricity dale vince , managing director of ecotricity , said : " it 's great to be building another wind turbine .
" this is what it is all about - creating clean energy sources .
" people across the country can choose to switch their supply and power their homes with green electricity at the same price as their local supplier . "
when it is complete , the turbine will generate enough power for more than 1,200 homes .
combined with the existing turbine put up in 1999 , it will supply 75 % of swaffham 's total home electricity requirements , boosting norfolk 's total wind power by 30 % .

decisions taken on friday will affect where patients have their operations in future , and how hospitals manage limited funds .
the royal cornwall hospital at treliske in truro is full to capacity and it is a similar story at derriford hospital in plymouth , which serves the north and east of the county .
the conference was looking at ways to take the pressure off them and make better use of cornwall 's community hospitals .
treatment centres all health trusts have been looking at ways to improve the way £ 470m a year is spent on healthcare across the county .
making better use of smaller hospitals , like one in falmouth which has hi-tech links with consultants elsewhere , could be one way of helping to cut waiting lists .
new diagnostic and treatment centres already proposed in some areas might also allow more day case surgery closer to where people live .
the organisers of the meeting in newquay say the whole community will have the chance to have a say and local mps and councillors have been invited to take part in the discussions .

steve lovatt , from nottingham , is being treated for head injuries at ysbyty gwynedd in bangor - his condition is described as serious but stable .
a team of air investigators will arrive in snowdonia on friday to try to find out why his light aircraft crash-landed .
national park wardens will help direct them to the spot on the elidir fawr mountain above the ogwen and nant peris valleys where the two-seater plane came down .
the piper tomahawk plane crashed just after 1500 bst on thursday .
first reports suggested mr lovatt - who was cut free from the wreckage of the cockpit in a three-hour operation - had escaped virtually unharmed .
a doctor who examined him at the scene said he was conscious .
he was stretchered down the mountain to a position from where he could be airlifted to hospital .
but doctors at ysbyty gwynedd in bangor showed concern about the nature of his head injuries , and he underwent a number of tests .
the pilot was airlifted to hospital reports suggest that he had to make a forced landing flight lieutenant kate diacin , who piloted the sea king rescue helicopter , said a rapid weather change could have caused the crash .
" he might have come into some bad weather - if the cloud base lowered quickly , he could have got disorientated and flown into cloud , " she said .
" if he ended up anywhere near the mountains in cloud , he was very lucky to get away with it .
" there are hardly any flat areas to land a helicopter , let alone a light aircraft that needs a good 200m to run on . "
there are not many plane crashes in snowdonia - the ogwen valley mountain rescue team estimates such accidents happen about once every seven years .
he is being treated for head injuries at ysbyty gwynedd in bangor but roger jones , one of the team leaders , believes that they could become more common .
" small private flying is becoming more and more popular , so i presume the chances of incidents will increase , " he said .
a major search got under way when the plane failed to turn up at caernarfon airport after taking off from nottingham at 0915 bst on thursday morning .
ogwen valley mountain rescue team had 10 people , supported by raf valley 22 squadron , searching a five mile radius of bethesda .
it made a routine navigation call to liverpool airport control 20 minutes later but then lost contact .
a group of mountain walkers had reported hearing an aircraft followed by a loud bang - it is not known if that noise was the crash or a fault on the plane which brought it down .
