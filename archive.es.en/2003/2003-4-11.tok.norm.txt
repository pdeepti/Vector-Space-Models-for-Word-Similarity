english-speaking news hounds interested in a german point of view from the country 's most-respected newsmagazine now have a new source for information - the new york times online . with little fanfare , the content of germany 's most-respected newsweekly , der spiegel , recently began appearing on the web site of america 's national newspaper of record , the new york times .
the internet outposts of both publishers - spiegel online and nytimes.com - began sharing stories a few weeks ago in a cross-pollination effort after controversy surrounding u.s. policy in iraq became a shared interest for germans and americans .
english speakers interested in the german point of view and germans whose english is good enough to read a new york times editorial can now be brought up to date at the click of a mouse .
" we said , ' why not translate at least the cover story in english and then put it on our site , " ' said matthias müller von blumencrone , editor in chief of spiegel online .
" then we had a second idea of finding a partner to trade this story with . "
that partner turned out to be nytimes.com.
about five weeks ago , the story-sharing began .
there is no financial aspect to the agreement .
international appeal is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush warriors spiegel online sends the new york times the magazine 's translated cover story , or whichever story is of broadest international appeal .
in return , spiegel online runs two or three general-interest stories from the times , but the lion 's share so far has been opinion pieces .
the latest spiegel stories featured on the new york times ' web site are an interview with former u.s. national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski and a feature on arabs from other nations who have volunteered to fight for iraq .
on the spiegel site , readers can find pulitzer prize-winning writer maureen dowd admonishing the bush administration not to turn the united states into another sparta or reminding congress , which recently rechristened french fries as " freedom fries , " that the capital city was designed by pierre-charles l 'enfant , a frenchman . the german publication does n't just pick what it thinks germans will like to read , however .
" the times editorial board is very mixed , " von blumencrone said .
" sometimes you read a piece and think , ' wow , how can they argue that ? '
but then , you know , it 's a widely made argument .
so let 's present it to our readers . "
another interesting aspect for germans is that " often the articles are very critical of bush .
then you know that the u.s. public is not 100 percent behind bush .
that 's something that is sometimes not very clear here , " von blumencrone says .
reader reaction is positive for the nytimes.com as well as spiegel online , the agreement is the latest of many .

the spiegel stories have gotten " a positive reaction , " nisenholtz said , but they also point up a limitation inherent in online media - and possibly a difference in the way germans and americans are used to digesting information .
" the spiegel articles are very long , written for magazine format , so the practical idea of reading them from a screen has its limitations , " he said .
new focus on germany ?
nonetheless , von blumencrone notes that there has been a good deal of interest in the german view .
spiegel stories on the times site have logged " up to 60,000 hits , which is n't much for a times story , but for us it 's a big number , " considering that the spiegel only has a small button on the right side of the screen in the international section of nytimes.com.

the agreement came into being based around the iraq conflict , " but who knows how long it will continue , " von blumencrone said .
" americans have an interest in the european position now , at least more than they did two years ago .
when it goes back to normal - normal being that most people in the u.s. are n't very interested in the german or european point of view - then we 'll see . "
but nisenholtz suggested that the deal should not be seen as a representation of a sudden leap in interest in the german point of view .
" speaking for the web site only , i do not think there has been a particular increased interest in german issues in recent months . ...

once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .
large oil revenues can provide only some of the relief . from berlin , the iraqi dissident kazem habib listens to the debate about postwar iraq - who will be the guiding force in the reconstruction of the country ?
the u.s.-led coalition that is fighting the war ?
or the united nations ?
but the economics professor knows that once these political questions are finally settled the international community will have to turn its attention to the numerous dollar-and-cents issues that litter the landscape much like the statues of saddam hussein scattered across the countryside .
" i think iraq needs about $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion to complete its reconstruction , " habib told deutsche welle .
" and it will not be a matter of one or two years .
we will need 10 to 15 years . "
legacy of war creates problems one of the primary reasons iraq will need such money lies in the war-pocked past of saddam 's iron rule .
" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .
u.s. seeks new iraqi leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed chalabi , a longtime iraqi exile who heads the iraqi national congress .
at this point , though , u.s. leaders are still focusing on ending the war and addressing the sticky political issues involved in creating an administration that could lead iraq toward this petro-dollar future .
as a first step in creating this administration , the united states is inviting more than 40 iraqi politicians to attend a saturday conference in southern iraq , said iraqi national congress leader ahmed chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the conference will be the first of a series of meetings that will culminate in a convention where a transitional government will be created , a spokesman for the u.s. state department said this week .
but the plan ran into immediate objections from one of the most important exile groups of iraqis , the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq .
" we can not participate in a military government of the country , " said hamid el bajati , a spokesman for the group in london .
the u.s. reconstruction effort is being led by the retired lt. gen. jay garner , who answers to the commander of the coalition forces , u.s. army gen. tommy franks .
garner has been critcized by arab groups for his support of israel and by humanitarian organizations for his military past .
chalabi , too , is seen as a divisive figure in the u.s. plan for a postwar iraq .
he is considered to be the favorite of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
but secretary of state colin powell reportedly prefers to wait and see who emerges as a potential leader during the upcoming debate over the future government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. offering partnership to u.n. in a postwar iraq the united states and some of its european partners argued intensely over the possibility of war against iraq .

we will need 10 to 15 years . "
legacy of war creates problems one of the primary reasons iraq will need such money lies in the war-pocked past of saddam 's iron rule .
" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .
u.s. seeks new iraqi leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed chalabi , a longtime iraqi exile who heads the iraqi national congress .
at this point , though , u.s. leaders are still focusing on ending the war and addressing the sticky political issues involved in creating an administration that could lead iraq toward this petro-dollar future .
as a first step in creating this administration , the united states is inviting more than 40 iraqi politicians to attend a saturday conference in southern iraq , said iraqi national congress leader ahmed chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the conference will be the first of a series of meetings that will culminate in a convention where a transitional government will be created , a spokesman for the u.s. state department said this week .

'
english-speaking news hounds interested in a german point of view from the country 's most-respected newsmagazine now have a new source for information - the new york times online . with little fanfare , the content of germany 's most-respected newsweekly , der spiegel , recently began appearing on the web site of america 's national newspaper of record , the new york times .
the internet outposts of both publishers - spiegel online and nytimes.com - began sharing stories a few weeks ago in a cross-pollination effort after controversy surrounding u.s. policy in iraq became a shared interest for germans and americans .
english speakers interested in the german point of view and germans whose english is good enough to read a new york times editorial can now be brought up to date at the click of a mouse .
" we said , ' why not translate at least the cover story in english and then put it on our site , " ' said matthias müller von blumencrone , editor in chief of spiegel online .
" then we had a second idea of finding a partner to trade this story with . "
that partner turned out to be nytimes.com.
about five weeks ago , the story-sharing began .
there is no financial aspect to the agreement .
international appeal is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush warriors spiegel online sends the new york times the magazine 's translated cover story , or whichever story is of broadest international appeal .
in return , spiegel online runs two or three general-interest stories from the times , but the lion 's share so far has been opinion pieces .
the latest spiegel stories featured on the new york times ' web site are an interview with former u.s. national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski and a feature on arabs from other nations who have volunteered to fight for iraq .
on the spiegel site , readers can find pulitzer prize-winning writer maureen dowd admonishing the bush administration not to turn the united states into another sparta or reminding congress , which recently rechristened french fries as " freedom fries , " that the capital city was designed by pierre-charles l 'enfant , a frenchman . the german publication does n't just pick what it thinks germans will like to read , however .
" the times editorial board is very mixed , " von blumencrone said .
" sometimes you read a piece and think , ' wow , how can they argue that ? '
but then , you know , it 's a widely made argument .
so let 's present it to our readers . "
another interesting aspect for germans is that " often the articles are very critical of bush .
then you know that the u.s. public is not 100 percent behind bush .
that 's something that is sometimes not very clear here , " von blumencrone says .
reader reaction is positive for the nytimes.com as well as spiegel online , the agreement is the latest of many .
epecially in the area of online news , content swapping is becoming ever more commonplace .
martin nisenholtz , nytimes.com ceo , notes that his company started first working with the financial times , then the british broadcasting corp. and now der spiegel .
" i hope we can continue to expand , " he adds .
the spiegel stories have gotten " a positive reaction , " nisenholtz said , but they also point up a limitation inherent in online media - and possibly a difference in the way germans and americans are used to digesting information .
" the spiegel articles are very long , written for magazine format , so the practical idea of reading them from a screen has its limitations , " he said .
new focus on germany ?
nonetheless , von blumencrone notes that there has been a good deal of interest in the german view .
spiegel stories on the times site have logged " up to 60,000 hits , which is n't much for a times story , but for us it 's a big number , " considering that the spiegel only has a small button on the right side of the screen in the international section of nytimes.com.
" but even then , people find it and appreciate it , " he said .
the agreement came into being based around the iraq conflict , " but who knows how long it will continue , " von blumencrone said .
" americans have an interest in the european position now , at least more than they did two years ago .
when it goes back to normal - normal being that most people in the u.s. are n't very interested in the german or european point of view - then we 'll see . "
but nisenholtz suggested that the deal should not be seen as a representation of a sudden leap in interest in the german point of view .
" speaking for the web site only , i do not think there has been a particular increased interest in german issues in recent months . ...
the diplomacy surrounding the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- , which of course involves germany , is an important part of the coverage .
but it would be wrong to say there is a particular focus on germany , " he said .

international appeal is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush warriors spiegel online sends the new york times the magazine 's translated cover story , or whichever story is of broadest international appeal .
in return , spiegel online runs two or three general-interest stories from the times , but the lion 's share so far has been opinion pieces .
the latest spiegel stories featured on the new york times ' web site are an interview with former u.s. national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski and a feature on arabs from other nations who have volunteered to fight for iraq .
on the spiegel site , readers can find pulitzer prize-winning writer maureen dowd admonishing the bush administration not to turn the united states into another sparta or reminding congress , which recently rechristened french fries as " freedom fries , " that the capital city was designed by pierre-charles l 'enfant , a frenchman . the german publication does n't just pick what it thinks germans will like to read , however .
" the times editorial board is very mixed , " von blumencrone said .
" sometimes you read a piece and think , ' wow , how can they argue that ? '
but then , you know , it 's a widely made argument .
so let 's present it to our readers . "
another interesting aspect for germans is that " often the articles are very critical of bush .
then you know that the u.s. public is not 100 percent behind bush .
that 's something that is sometimes not very clear here , " von blumencrone says .
reader reaction is positive for the nytimes.com as well as spiegel online , the agreement is the latest of many .
epecially in the area of online news , content swapping is becoming ever more commonplace .
martin nisenholtz , nytimes.com ceo , notes that his company started first working with the financial times , then the british broadcasting corp. and now der spiegel .
" i hope we can continue to expand , " he adds .
the spiegel stories have gotten " a positive reaction , " nisenholtz said , but they also point up a limitation inherent in online media - and possibly a difference in the way germans and americans are used to digesting information .
" the spiegel articles are very long , written for magazine format , so the practical idea of reading them from a screen has its limitations , " he said .
new focus on germany ?
nonetheless , von blumencrone notes that there has been a good deal of interest in the german view .
spiegel stories on the times site have logged " up to 60,000 hits , which is n't much for a times story , but for us it 's a big number , " considering that the spiegel only has a small button on the right side of the screen in the international section of nytimes.com.
" but even then , people find it and appreciate it , " he said .
the agreement came into being based around the iraq conflict , " but who knows how long it will continue , " von blumencrone said .
" americans have an interest in the european position now , at least more than they did two years ago .
when it goes back to normal - normal being that most people in the u.s. are n't very interested in the german or european point of view - then we 'll see . "
but nisenholtz suggested that the deal should not be seen as a representation of a sudden leap in interest in the german point of view .
" speaking for the web site only , i do not think there has been a particular increased interest in german issues in recent months . ...
the diplomacy surrounding the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- , which of course involves germany , is an important part of the coverage .
but it would be wrong to say there is a particular focus on germany , " he said .

once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .
large oil revenues can provide only some of the relief . from berlin , the iraqi dissident kazem habib listens to the debate about postwar iraq - who will be the guiding force in the reconstruction of the country ?
the u.s.-led coalition that is fighting the war ?
or the united nations ?
but the economics professor knows that once these political questions are finally settled the international community will have to turn its attention to the numerous dollar-and-cents issues that litter the landscape much like the statues of saddam hussein scattered across the countryside .
" i think iraq needs about $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion to complete its reconstruction , " habib told deutsche welle .
" and it will not be a matter of one or two years .
we will need 10 to 15 years . "
legacy of war creates problems one of the primary reasons iraq will need such money lies in the war-pocked past of saddam 's iron rule .
" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .
u.s. seeks new iraqi leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed chalabi , a longtime iraqi exile who heads the iraqi national congress .
at this point , though , u.s. leaders are still focusing on ending the war and addressing the sticky political issues involved in creating an administration that could lead iraq toward this petro-dollar future .
as a first step in creating this administration , the united states is inviting more than 40 iraqi politicians to attend a saturday conference in southern iraq , said iraqi national congress leader ahmed chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the conference will be the first of a series of meetings that will culminate in a convention where a transitional government will be created , a spokesman for the u.s. state department said this week .
but the plan ran into immediate objections from one of the most important exile groups of iraqis , the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq .
" we can not participate in a military government of the country , " said hamid el bajati , a spokesman for the group in london .
the u.s. reconstruction effort is being led by the retired lt. gen. jay garner , who answers to the commander of the coalition forces , u.s. army gen. tommy franks .
garner has been critcized by arab groups for his support of israel and by humanitarian organizations for his military past .
chalabi , too , is seen as a divisive figure in the u.s. plan for a postwar iraq .
he is considered to be the favorite of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
but secretary of state colin powell reportedly prefers to wait and see who emerges as a potential leader during the upcoming debate over the future government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. offering partnership to u.n. in a postwar iraq the united states and some of its european partners argued intensely over the possibility of war against iraq .

once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .
large oil revenues can provide only some of the relief . from berlin , the iraqi dissident kazem habib listens to the debate about postwar iraq - who will be the guiding force in the reconstruction of the country ?
the u.s.-led coalition that is fighting the war ?
or the united nations ?
but the economics professor knows that once these political questions are finally settled the international community will have to turn its attention to the numerous dollar-and-cents issues that litter the landscape much like the statues of saddam hussein scattered across the countryside .
" i think iraq needs about $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion to complete its reconstruction , " habib told deutsche welle .
" and it will not be a matter of one or two years .
we will need 10 to 15 years . "
legacy of war creates problems one of the primary reasons iraq will need such money lies in the war-pocked past of saddam 's iron rule .
" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.04.2003 iraq looks toward rebuilding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein is apparently gone , who will take his place ?
once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .
large oil revenues can provide only some of the relief . from berlin , the iraqi dissident kazem habib listens to the debate about postwar iraq - who will be the guiding force in the reconstruction of the country ?
the u.s.-led coalition that is fighting the war ?
or the united nations ?
but the economics professor knows that once these political questions are finally settled the international community will have to turn its attention to the numerous dollar-and-cents issues that litter the landscape much like the statues of saddam hussein scattered across the countryside .
" i think iraq needs about $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion to complete its reconstruction , " habib told deutsche welle .
" and it will not be a matter of one or two years .
we will need 10 to 15 years . "
legacy of war creates problems one of the primary reasons iraq will need such money lies in the war-pocked past of saddam 's iron rule .
" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .
u.s. seeks new iraqi leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed chalabi , a longtime iraqi exile who heads the iraqi national congress .
at this point , though , u.s. leaders are still focusing on ending the war and addressing the sticky political issues involved in creating an administration that could lead iraq toward this petro-dollar future .
as a first step in creating this administration , the united states is inviting more than 40 iraqi politicians to attend a saturday conference in southern iraq , said iraqi national congress leader ahmed chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the conference will be the first of a series of meetings that will culminate in a convention where a transitional government will be created , a spokesman for the u.s. state department said this week .

once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .
large oil revenues can provide only some of the relief . from berlin , the iraqi dissident kazem habib listens to the debate about postwar iraq - who will be the guiding force in the reconstruction of the country ?
the u.s.-led coalition that is fighting the war ?
or the united nations ?
but the economics professor knows that once these political questions are finally settled the international community will have to turn its attention to the numerous dollar-and-cents issues that litter the landscape much like the statues of saddam hussein scattered across the countryside .
" i think iraq needs about $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion to complete its reconstruction , " habib told deutsche welle .
" and it will not be a matter of one or two years .
we will need 10 to 15 years . "
legacy of war creates problems one of the primary reasons iraq will need such money lies in the war-pocked past of saddam 's iron rule .
" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .
u.s. seeks new iraqi leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed chalabi , a longtime iraqi exile who heads the iraqi national congress .
at this point , though , u.s. leaders are still focusing on ending the war and addressing the sticky political issues involved in creating an administration that could lead iraq toward this petro-dollar future .
as a first step in creating this administration , the united states is inviting more than 40 iraqi politicians to attend a saturday conference in southern iraq , said iraqi national congress leader ahmed chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the conference will be the first of a series of meetings that will culminate in a convention where a transitional government will be created , a spokesman for the u.s. state department said this week .
but the plan ran into immediate objections from one of the most important exile groups of iraqis , the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq .
" we can not participate in a military government of the country , " said hamid el bajati , a spokesman for the group in london .
the u.s. reconstruction effort is being led by the retired lt. gen. jay garner , who answers to the commander of the coalition forces , u.s. army gen. tommy franks .
garner has been critcized by arab groups for his support of israel and by humanitarian organizations for his military past .
chalabi , too , is seen as a divisive figure in the u.s. plan for a postwar iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.04.2003 der spiegel mirrors itself in english großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nytimes.com readers can access spiegel stories like this one , ' the battle for baghdad . '
english-speaking news hounds interested in a german point of view from the country 's most-respected newsmagazine now have a new source for information - the new york times online . with little fanfare , the content of germany 's most-respected newsweekly , der spiegel , recently began appearing on the web site of america 's national newspaper of record , the new york times .
the internet outposts of both publishers - spiegel online and nytimes.com - began sharing stories a few weeks ago in a cross-pollination effort after controversy surrounding u.s. policy in iraq became a shared interest for germans and americans .
english speakers interested in the german point of view and germans whose english is good enough to read a new york times editorial can now be brought up to date at the click of a mouse .
" we said , ' why not translate at least the cover story in english and then put it on our site , " ' said matthias müller von blumencrone , editor in chief of spiegel online .
" then we had a second idea of finding a partner to trade this story with . "
that partner turned out to be nytimes.com.
about five weeks ago , the story-sharing began .
there is no financial aspect to the agreement .
international appeal is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush warriors spiegel online sends the new york times the magazine 's translated cover story , or whichever story is of broadest international appeal .
in return , spiegel online runs two or three general-interest stories from the times , but the lion 's share so far has been opinion pieces .
the latest spiegel stories featured on the new york times ' web site are an interview with former u.s. national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski and a feature on arabs from other nations who have volunteered to fight for iraq .
on the spiegel site , readers can find pulitzer prize-winning writer maureen dowd admonishing the bush administration not to turn the united states into another sparta or reminding congress , which recently rechristened french fries as " freedom fries , " that the capital city was designed by pierre-charles l 'enfant , a frenchman . the german publication does n't just pick what it thinks germans will like to read , however .
" the times editorial board is very mixed , " von blumencrone said .
" sometimes you read a piece and think , ' wow , how can they argue that ? '
but then , you know , it 's a widely made argument .
so let 's present it to our readers . "
another interesting aspect for germans is that " often the articles are very critical of bush .
then you know that the u.s. public is not 100 percent behind bush .
that 's something that is sometimes not very clear here , " von blumencrone says .
reader reaction is positive for the nytimes.com as well as spiegel online , the agreement is the latest of many .
epecially in the area of online news , content swapping is becoming ever more commonplace .
martin nisenholtz , nytimes.com ceo , notes that his company started first working with the financial times , then the british broadcasting corp. and now der spiegel .
" i hope we can continue to expand , " he adds .
the spiegel stories have gotten " a positive reaction , " nisenholtz said , but they also point up a limitation inherent in online media - and possibly a difference in the way germans and americans are used to digesting information .
" the spiegel articles are very long , written for magazine format , so the practical idea of reading them from a screen has its limitations , " he said .
new focus on germany ?
nonetheless , von blumencrone notes that there has been a good deal of interest in the german view .
spiegel stories on the times site have logged " up to 60,000 hits , which is n't much for a times story , but for us it 's a big number , " considering that the spiegel only has a small button on the right side of the screen in the international section of nytimes.com.
" but even then , people find it and appreciate it , " he said .
the agreement came into being based around the iraq conflict , " but who knows how long it will continue , " von blumencrone said .
" americans have an interest in the european position now , at least more than they did two years ago .
when it goes back to normal - normal being that most people in the u.s. are n't very interested in the german or european point of view - then we 'll see . "
but nisenholtz suggested that the deal should not be seen as a representation of a sudden leap in interest in the german point of view .
" speaking for the web site only , i do not think there has been a particular increased interest in german issues in recent months . ...
the diplomacy surrounding the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- , which of course involves germany , is an important part of the coverage .
but it would be wrong to say there is a particular focus on germany , " he said .

english-speaking news hounds interested in a german point of view from the country 's most-respected newsmagazine now have a new source for information - the new york times online . with little fanfare , the content of germany 's most-respected newsweekly , der spiegel , recently began appearing on the web site of america 's national newspaper of record , the new york times .
the internet outposts of both publishers - spiegel online and nytimes.com - began sharing stories a few weeks ago in a cross-pollination effort after controversy surrounding u.s. policy in iraq became a shared interest for germans and americans .
english speakers interested in the german point of view and germans whose english is good enough to read a new york times editorial can now be brought up to date at the click of a mouse .
" we said , ' why not translate at least the cover story in english and then put it on our site , " ' said matthias müller von blumencrone , editor in chief of spiegel online .
" then we had a second idea of finding a partner to trade this story with . "
that partner turned out to be nytimes.com.
about five weeks ago , the story-sharing began .
there is no financial aspect to the agreement .
international appeal is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush warriors spiegel online sends the new york times the magazine 's translated cover story , or whichever story is of broadest international appeal .
in return , spiegel online runs two or three general-interest stories from the times , but the lion 's share so far has been opinion pieces .
the latest spiegel stories featured on the new york times ' web site are an interview with former u.s. national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski and a feature on arabs from other nations who have volunteered to fight for iraq .
on the spiegel site , readers can find pulitzer prize-winning writer maureen dowd admonishing the bush administration not to turn the united states into another sparta or reminding congress , which recently rechristened french fries as " freedom fries , " that the capital city was designed by pierre-charles l 'enfant , a frenchman . the german publication does n't just pick what it thinks germans will like to read , however .
" the times editorial board is very mixed , " von blumencrone said .
" sometimes you read a piece and think , ' wow , how can they argue that ? '
but then , you know , it 's a widely made argument .
so let 's present it to our readers . "
another interesting aspect for germans is that " often the articles are very critical of bush .
then you know that the u.s. public is not 100 percent behind bush .
that 's something that is sometimes not very clear here , " von blumencrone says .
reader reaction is positive for the nytimes.com as well as spiegel online , the agreement is the latest of many .
epecially in the area of online news , content swapping is becoming ever more commonplace .
martin nisenholtz , nytimes.com ceo , notes that his company started first working with the financial times , then the british broadcasting corp. and now der spiegel .
" i hope we can continue to expand , " he adds .
the spiegel stories have gotten " a positive reaction , " nisenholtz said , but they also point up a limitation inherent in online media - and possibly a difference in the way germans and americans are used to digesting information .
" the spiegel articles are very long , written for magazine format , so the practical idea of reading them from a screen has its limitations , " he said .
new focus on germany ?
nonetheless , von blumencrone notes that there has been a good deal of interest in the german view .
spiegel stories on the times site have logged " up to 60,000 hits , which is n't much for a times story , but for us it 's a big number , " considering that the spiegel only has a small button on the right side of the screen in the international section of nytimes.com.
" but even then , people find it and appreciate it , " he said .
the agreement came into being based around the iraq conflict , " but who knows how long it will continue , " von blumencrone said .
" americans have an interest in the european position now , at least more than they did two years ago .
when it goes back to normal - normal being that most people in the u.s. are n't very interested in the german or european point of view - then we 'll see . "
but nisenholtz suggested that the deal should not be seen as a representation of a sudden leap in interest in the german point of view .
" speaking for the web site only , i do not think there has been a particular increased interest in german issues in recent months . ...
the diplomacy surrounding the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- , which of course involves germany , is an important part of the coverage .
but it would be wrong to say there is a particular focus on germany , " he said .

once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .
large oil revenues can provide only some of the relief . from berlin , the iraqi dissident kazem habib listens to the debate about postwar iraq - who will be the guiding force in the reconstruction of the country ?
the u.s.-led coalition that is fighting the war ?
or the united nations ?
but the economics professor knows that once these political questions are finally settled the international community will have to turn its attention to the numerous dollar-and-cents issues that litter the landscape much like the statues of saddam hussein scattered across the countryside .
" i think iraq needs about $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion to complete its reconstruction , " habib told deutsche welle .
" and it will not be a matter of one or two years .
we will need 10 to 15 years . "
legacy of war creates problems one of the primary reasons iraq will need such money lies in the war-pocked past of saddam 's iron rule .
" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .
u.s. seeks new iraqi leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed chalabi , a longtime iraqi exile who heads the iraqi national congress .
at this point , though , u.s. leaders are still focusing on ending the war and addressing the sticky political issues involved in creating an administration that could lead iraq toward this petro-dollar future .
as a first step in creating this administration , the united states is inviting more than 40 iraqi politicians to attend a saturday conference in southern iraq , said iraqi national congress leader ahmed chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the conference will be the first of a series of meetings that will culminate in a convention where a transitional government will be created , a spokesman for the u.s. state department said this week .
but the plan ran into immediate objections from one of the most important exile groups of iraqis , the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq .
" we can not participate in a military government of the country , " said hamid el bajati , a spokesman for the group in london .
the u.s. reconstruction effort is being led by the retired lt. gen. jay garner , who answers to the commander of the coalition forces , u.s. army gen. tommy franks .
garner has been critcized by arab groups for his support of israel and by humanitarian organizations for his military past .
chalabi , too , is seen as a divisive figure in the u.s. plan for a postwar iraq .
he is considered to be the favorite of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
but secretary of state colin powell reportedly prefers to wait and see who emerges as a potential leader during the upcoming debate over the future government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. offering partnership to u.n. in a postwar iraq the united states and some of its european partners argued intensely over the possibility of war against iraq .

" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .
u.s. seeks new iraqi leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed chalabi , a longtime iraqi exile who heads the iraqi national congress .
at this point , though , u.s. leaders are still focusing on ending the war and addressing the sticky political issues involved in creating an administration that could lead iraq toward this petro-dollar future .
as a first step in creating this administration , the united states is inviting more than 40 iraqi politicians to attend a saturday conference in southern iraq , said iraqi national congress leader ahmed chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the conference will be the first of a series of meetings that will culminate in a convention where a transitional government will be created , a spokesman for the u.s. state department said this week .
but the plan ran into immediate objections from one of the most important exile groups of iraqis , the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq .
" we can not participate in a military government of the country , " said hamid el bajati , a spokesman for the group in london .
the u.s. reconstruction effort is being led by the retired lt. gen. jay garner , who answers to the commander of the coalition forces , u.s. army gen. tommy franks .
garner has been critcized by arab groups for his support of israel and by humanitarian organizations for his military past .
chalabi , too , is seen as a divisive figure in the u.s. plan for a postwar iraq .
he is considered to be the favorite of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
but secretary of state colin powell reportedly prefers to wait and see who emerges as a potential leader during the upcoming debate over the future government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. offering partnership to u.n. in a postwar iraq the united states and some of its european partners argued intensely over the possibility of war against iraq .

english-speaking news hounds interested in a german point of view from the country 's most-respected newsmagazine now have a new source for information - the new york times online . with little fanfare , the content of germany 's most-respected newsweekly , der spiegel , recently began appearing on the web site of america 's national newspaper of record , the new york times .
the internet outposts of both publishers - spiegel online and nytimes.com - began sharing stories a few weeks ago in a cross-pollination effort after controversy surrounding u.s. policy in iraq became a shared interest for germans and americans .
english speakers interested in the german point of view and germans whose english is good enough to read a new york times editorial can now be brought up to date at the click of a mouse .
" we said , ' why not translate at least the cover story in english and then put it on our site , " ' said matthias müller von blumencrone , editor in chief of spiegel online .
" then we had a second idea of finding a partner to trade this story with . "
that partner turned out to be nytimes.com.
about five weeks ago , the story-sharing began .
there is no financial aspect to the agreement .
international appeal is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush warriors spiegel online sends the new york times the magazine 's translated cover story , or whichever story is of broadest international appeal .
in return , spiegel online runs two or three general-interest stories from the times , but the lion 's share so far has been opinion pieces .
the latest spiegel stories featured on the new york times ' web site are an interview with former u.s. national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski and a feature on arabs from other nations who have volunteered to fight for iraq .
on the spiegel site , readers can find pulitzer prize-winning writer maureen dowd admonishing the bush administration not to turn the united states into another sparta or reminding congress , which recently rechristened french fries as " freedom fries , " that the capital city was designed by pierre-charles l 'enfant , a frenchman . the german publication does n't just pick what it thinks germans will like to read , however .
" the times editorial board is very mixed , " von blumencrone said .
" sometimes you read a piece and think , ' wow , how can they argue that ? '
but then , you know , it 's a widely made argument .
so let 's present it to our readers . "
another interesting aspect for germans is that " often the articles are very critical of bush .
then you know that the u.s. public is not 100 percent behind bush .
that 's something that is sometimes not very clear here , " von blumencrone says .
reader reaction is positive for the nytimes.com as well as spiegel online , the agreement is the latest of many .
epecially in the area of online news , content swapping is becoming ever more commonplace .
martin nisenholtz , nytimes.com ceo , notes that his company started first working with the financial times , then the british broadcasting corp. and now der spiegel .
" i hope we can continue to expand , " he adds .
the spiegel stories have gotten " a positive reaction , " nisenholtz said , but they also point up a limitation inherent in online media - and possibly a difference in the way germans and americans are used to digesting information .
" the spiegel articles are very long , written for magazine format , so the practical idea of reading them from a screen has its limitations , " he said .
new focus on germany ?
nonetheless , von blumencrone notes that there has been a good deal of interest in the german view .
spiegel stories on the times site have logged " up to 60,000 hits , which is n't much for a times story , but for us it 's a big number , " considering that the spiegel only has a small button on the right side of the screen in the international section of nytimes.com.
" but even then , people find it and appreciate it , " he said .
the agreement came into being based around the iraq conflict , " but who knows how long it will continue , " von blumencrone said .
" americans have an interest in the european position now , at least more than they did two years ago .
when it goes back to normal - normal being that most people in the u.s. are n't very interested in the german or european point of view - then we 'll see . "
but nisenholtz suggested that the deal should not be seen as a representation of a sudden leap in interest in the german point of view .
" speaking for the web site only , i do not think there has been a particular increased interest in german issues in recent months . ...
the diplomacy surrounding the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- , which of course involves germany , is an important part of the coverage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.04.2003 iraq looks toward rebuilding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein is apparently gone , who will take his place ?
once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .
large oil revenues can provide only some of the relief . from berlin , the iraqi dissident kazem habib listens to the debate about postwar iraq - who will be the guiding force in the reconstruction of the country ?
the u.s.-led coalition that is fighting the war ?
or the united nations ?
but the economics professor knows that once these political questions are finally settled the international community will have to turn its attention to the numerous dollar-and-cents issues that litter the landscape much like the statues of saddam hussein scattered across the countryside .
" i think iraq needs about $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion to complete its reconstruction , " habib told deutsche welle .
" and it will not be a matter of one or two years .
we will need 10 to 15 years . "
legacy of war creates problems one of the primary reasons iraq will need such money lies in the war-pocked past of saddam 's iron rule .
" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .
u.s. seeks new iraqi leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed chalabi , a longtime iraqi exile who heads the iraqi national congress .

once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .
large oil revenues can provide only some of the relief . from berlin , the iraqi dissident kazem habib listens to the debate about postwar iraq - who will be the guiding force in the reconstruction of the country ?
the u.s.-led coalition that is fighting the war ?
or the united nations ?
but the economics professor knows that once these political questions are finally settled the international community will have to turn its attention to the numerous dollar-and-cents issues that litter the landscape much like the statues of saddam hussein scattered across the countryside .
" i think iraq needs about $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion to complete its reconstruction , " habib told deutsche welle .
" and it will not be a matter of one or two years .
we will need 10 to 15 years . "
legacy of war creates problems one of the primary reasons iraq will need such money lies in the war-pocked past of saddam 's iron rule .
" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .

english-speaking news hounds interested in a german point of view from the country 's most-respected newsmagazine now have a new source for information - the new york times online . with little fanfare , the content of germany 's most-respected newsweekly , der spiegel , recently began appearing on the web site of america 's national newspaper of record , the new york times .
the internet outposts of both publishers - spiegel online and nytimes.com - began sharing stories a few weeks ago in a cross-pollination effort after controversy surrounding u.s. policy in iraq became a shared interest for germans and americans .
english speakers interested in the german point of view and germans whose english is good enough to read a new york times editorial can now be brought up to date at the click of a mouse .
" we said , ' why not translate at least the cover story in english and then put it on our site , " ' said matthias müller von blumencrone , editor in chief of spiegel online .
" then we had a second idea of finding a partner to trade this story with . "
that partner turned out to be nytimes.com.
about five weeks ago , the story-sharing began .
there is no financial aspect to the agreement .
international appeal is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush warriors spiegel online sends the new york times the magazine 's translated cover story , or whichever story is of broadest international appeal .
in return , spiegel online runs two or three general-interest stories from the times , but the lion 's share so far has been opinion pieces .
the latest spiegel stories featured on the new york times ' web site are an interview with former u.s. national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski and a feature on arabs from other nations who have volunteered to fight for iraq .
on the spiegel site , readers can find pulitzer prize-winning writer maureen dowd admonishing the bush administration not to turn the united states into another sparta or reminding congress , which recently rechristened french fries as " freedom fries , " that the capital city was designed by pierre-charles l 'enfant , a frenchman . the german publication does n't just pick what it thinks germans will like to read , however .
" the times editorial board is very mixed , " von blumencrone said .
" sometimes you read a piece and think , ' wow , how can they argue that ? '
but then , you know , it 's a widely made argument .
so let 's present it to our readers . "
another interesting aspect for germans is that " often the articles are very critical of bush .
then you know that the u.s. public is not 100 percent behind bush .
that 's something that is sometimes not very clear here , " von blumencrone says .
reader reaction is positive for the nytimes.com as well as spiegel online , the agreement is the latest of many .
epecially in the area of online news , content swapping is becoming ever more commonplace .
martin nisenholtz , nytimes.com ceo , notes that his company started first working with the financial times , then the british broadcasting corp. and now der spiegel .
" i hope we can continue to expand , " he adds .
the spiegel stories have gotten " a positive reaction , " nisenholtz said , but they also point up a limitation inherent in online media - and possibly a difference in the way germans and americans are used to digesting information .
" the spiegel articles are very long , written for magazine format , so the practical idea of reading them from a screen has its limitations , " he said .
new focus on germany ?
nonetheless , von blumencrone notes that there has been a good deal of interest in the german view .
spiegel stories on the times site have logged " up to 60,000 hits , which is n't much for a times story , but for us it 's a big number , " considering that the spiegel only has a small button on the right side of the screen in the international section of nytimes.com.
" but even then , people find it and appreciate it , " he said .
the agreement came into being based around the iraq conflict , " but who knows how long it will continue , " von blumencrone said .
" americans have an interest in the european position now , at least more than they did two years ago .
when it goes back to normal - normal being that most people in the u.s. are n't very interested in the german or european point of view - then we 'll see . "
but nisenholtz suggested that the deal should not be seen as a representation of a sudden leap in interest in the german point of view .
" speaking for the web site only , i do not think there has been a particular increased interest in german issues in recent months . ...
the diplomacy surrounding the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- , which of course involves germany , is an important part of the coverage .

'
english-speaking news hounds interested in a german point of view from the country 's most-respected newsmagazine now have a new source for information - the new york times online . with little fanfare , the content of germany 's most-respected newsweekly , der spiegel , recently began appearing on the web site of america 's national newspaper of record , the new york times .
the internet outposts of both publishers - spiegel online and nytimes.com - began sharing stories a few weeks ago in a cross-pollination effort after controversy surrounding u.s. policy in iraq became a shared interest for germans and americans .
english speakers interested in the german point of view and germans whose english is good enough to read a new york times editorial can now be brought up to date at the click of a mouse .
" we said , ' why not translate at least the cover story in english and then put it on our site , " ' said matthias müller von blumencrone , editor in chief of spiegel online .
" then we had a second idea of finding a partner to trade this story with . "
that partner turned out to be nytimes.com.
about five weeks ago , the story-sharing began .
there is no financial aspect to the agreement .
international appeal is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush warriors spiegel online sends the new york times the magazine 's translated cover story , or whichever story is of broadest international appeal .
in return , spiegel online runs two or three general-interest stories from the times , but the lion 's share so far has been opinion pieces .
the latest spiegel stories featured on the new york times ' web site are an interview with former u.s. national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski and a feature on arabs from other nations who have volunteered to fight for iraq .
on the spiegel site , readers can find pulitzer prize-winning writer maureen dowd admonishing the bush administration not to turn the united states into another sparta or reminding congress , which recently rechristened french fries as " freedom fries , " that the capital city was designed by pierre-charles l 'enfant , a frenchman . the german publication does n't just pick what it thinks germans will like to read , however .
" the times editorial board is very mixed , " von blumencrone said .
" sometimes you read a piece and think , ' wow , how can they argue that ? '
but then , you know , it 's a widely made argument .
so let 's present it to our readers . "
another interesting aspect for germans is that " often the articles are very critical of bush .
then you know that the u.s. public is not 100 percent behind bush .
that 's something that is sometimes not very clear here , " von blumencrone says .
reader reaction is positive for the nytimes.com as well as spiegel online , the agreement is the latest of many .
epecially in the area of online news , content swapping is becoming ever more commonplace .
martin nisenholtz , nytimes.com ceo , notes that his company started first working with the financial times , then the british broadcasting corp. and now der spiegel .
" i hope we can continue to expand , " he adds .
the spiegel stories have gotten " a positive reaction , " nisenholtz said , but they also point up a limitation inherent in online media - and possibly a difference in the way germans and americans are used to digesting information .
" the spiegel articles are very long , written for magazine format , so the practical idea of reading them from a screen has its limitations , " he said .
new focus on germany ?
nonetheless , von blumencrone notes that there has been a good deal of interest in the german view .
spiegel stories on the times site have logged " up to 60,000 hits , which is n't much for a times story , but for us it 's a big number , " considering that the spiegel only has a small button on the right side of the screen in the international section of nytimes.com.
" but even then , people find it and appreciate it , " he said .
the agreement came into being based around the iraq conflict , " but who knows how long it will continue , " von blumencrone said .
" americans have an interest in the european position now , at least more than they did two years ago .
when it goes back to normal - normal being that most people in the u.s. are n't very interested in the german or european point of view - then we 'll see . "
but nisenholtz suggested that the deal should not be seen as a representation of a sudden leap in interest in the german point of view .
" speaking for the web site only , i do not think there has been a particular increased interest in german issues in recent months . ...

once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .
large oil revenues can provide only some of the relief . from berlin , the iraqi dissident kazem habib listens to the debate about postwar iraq - who will be the guiding force in the reconstruction of the country ?
the u.s.-led coalition that is fighting the war ?
or the united nations ?
but the economics professor knows that once these political questions are finally settled the international community will have to turn its attention to the numerous dollar-and-cents issues that litter the landscape much like the statues of saddam hussein scattered across the countryside .
" i think iraq needs about $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion to complete its reconstruction , " habib told deutsche welle .
" and it will not be a matter of one or two years .
we will need 10 to 15 years . "
legacy of war creates problems one of the primary reasons iraq will need such money lies in the war-pocked past of saddam 's iron rule .
" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .
u.s. seeks new iraqi leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed chalabi , a longtime iraqi exile who heads the iraqi national congress .
at this point , though , u.s. leaders are still focusing on ending the war and addressing the sticky political issues involved in creating an administration that could lead iraq toward this petro-dollar future .
as a first step in creating this administration , the united states is inviting more than 40 iraqi politicians to attend a saturday conference in southern iraq , said iraqi national congress leader ahmed chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the conference will be the first of a series of meetings that will culminate in a convention where a transitional government will be created , a spokesman for the u.s. state department said this week .
but the plan ran into immediate objections from one of the most important exile groups of iraqis , the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq .
" we can not participate in a military government of the country , " said hamid el bajati , a spokesman for the group in london .
the u.s. reconstruction effort is being led by the retired lt. gen. jay garner , who answers to the commander of the coalition forces , u.s. army gen. tommy franks .
garner has been critcized by arab groups for his support of israel and by humanitarian organizations for his military past .
chalabi , too , is seen as a divisive figure in the u.s. plan for a postwar iraq .
he is considered to be the favorite of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .

'
english-speaking news hounds interested in a german point of view from the country 's most-respected newsmagazine now have a new source for information - the new york times online . with little fanfare , the content of germany 's most-respected newsweekly , der spiegel , recently began appearing on the web site of america 's national newspaper of record , the new york times .
the internet outposts of both publishers - spiegel online and nytimes.com - began sharing stories a few weeks ago in a cross-pollination effort after controversy surrounding u.s. policy in iraq became a shared interest for germans and americans .
english speakers interested in the german point of view and germans whose english is good enough to read a new york times editorial can now be brought up to date at the click of a mouse .
" we said , ' why not translate at least the cover story in english and then put it on our site , " ' said matthias müller von blumencrone , editor in chief of spiegel online .
" then we had a second idea of finding a partner to trade this story with . "
that partner turned out to be nytimes.com.
about five weeks ago , the story-sharing began .
there is no financial aspect to the agreement .
international appeal is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush warriors spiegel online sends the new york times the magazine 's translated cover story , or whichever story is of broadest international appeal .
in return , spiegel online runs two or three general-interest stories from the times , but the lion 's share so far has been opinion pieces .
the latest spiegel stories featured on the new york times ' web site are an interview with former u.s. national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski and a feature on arabs from other nations who have volunteered to fight for iraq .
on the spiegel site , readers can find pulitzer prize-winning writer maureen dowd admonishing the bush administration not to turn the united states into another sparta or reminding congress , which recently rechristened french fries as " freedom fries , " that the capital city was designed by pierre-charles l 'enfant , a frenchman . the german publication does n't just pick what it thinks germans will like to read , however .
" the times editorial board is very mixed , " von blumencrone said .
" sometimes you read a piece and think , ' wow , how can they argue that ? '
but then , you know , it 's a widely made argument .
so let 's present it to our readers . "
another interesting aspect for germans is that " often the articles are very critical of bush .
then you know that the u.s. public is not 100 percent behind bush .
that 's something that is sometimes not very clear here , " von blumencrone says .
reader reaction is positive for the nytimes.com as well as spiegel online , the agreement is the latest of many .
epecially in the area of online news , content swapping is becoming ever more commonplace .
martin nisenholtz , nytimes.com ceo , notes that his company started first working with the financial times , then the british broadcasting corp. and now der spiegel .
" i hope we can continue to expand , " he adds .
the spiegel stories have gotten " a positive reaction , " nisenholtz said , but they also point up a limitation inherent in online media - and possibly a difference in the way germans and americans are used to digesting information .
" the spiegel articles are very long , written for magazine format , so the practical idea of reading them from a screen has its limitations , " he said .
new focus on germany ?
nonetheless , von blumencrone notes that there has been a good deal of interest in the german view .
spiegel stories on the times site have logged " up to 60,000 hits , which is n't much for a times story , but for us it 's a big number , " considering that the spiegel only has a small button on the right side of the screen in the international section of nytimes.com.
" but even then , people find it and appreciate it , " he said .
the agreement came into being based around the iraq conflict , " but who knows how long it will continue , " von blumencrone said .
" americans have an interest in the european position now , at least more than they did two years ago .
when it goes back to normal - normal being that most people in the u.s. are n't very interested in the german or european point of view - then we 'll see . "
but nisenholtz suggested that the deal should not be seen as a representation of a sudden leap in interest in the german point of view .
" speaking for the web site only , i do not think there has been a particular increased interest in german issues in recent months . ...
the diplomacy surrounding the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- , which of course involves germany , is an important part of the coverage .
but it would be wrong to say there is a particular focus on germany , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.04.2003 iraq looks toward rebuilding großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein is apparently gone , who will take his place ?
once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .
large oil revenues can provide only some of the relief . from berlin , the iraqi dissident kazem habib listens to the debate about postwar iraq - who will be the guiding force in the reconstruction of the country ?
the u.s.-led coalition that is fighting the war ?
or the united nations ?
but the economics professor knows that once these political questions are finally settled the international community will have to turn its attention to the numerous dollar-and-cents issues that litter the landscape much like the statues of saddam hussein scattered across the countryside .
" i think iraq needs about $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion to complete its reconstruction , " habib told deutsche welle .
" and it will not be a matter of one or two years .
we will need 10 to 15 years . "
legacy of war creates problems one of the primary reasons iraq will need such money lies in the war-pocked past of saddam 's iron rule .
" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .
u.s. seeks new iraqi leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed chalabi , a longtime iraqi exile who heads the iraqi national congress .
at this point , though , u.s. leaders are still focusing on ending the war and addressing the sticky political issues involved in creating an administration that could lead iraq toward this petro-dollar future .
as a first step in creating this administration , the united states is inviting more than 40 iraqi politicians to attend a saturday conference in southern iraq , said iraqi national congress leader ahmed chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the conference will be the first of a series of meetings that will culminate in a convention where a transitional government will be created , a spokesman for the u.s. state department said this week .
but the plan ran into immediate objections from one of the most important exile groups of iraqis , the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq .
" we can not participate in a military government of the country , " said hamid el bajati , a spokesman for the group in london .
the u.s. reconstruction effort is being led by the retired lt. gen. jay garner , who answers to the commander of the coalition forces , u.s. army gen. tommy franks .
garner has been critcized by arab groups for his support of israel and by humanitarian organizations for his military past .
chalabi , too , is seen as a divisive figure in the u.s. plan for a postwar iraq .
he is considered to be the favorite of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld .
but secretary of state colin powell reportedly prefers to wait and see who emerges as a potential leader during the upcoming debate over the future government . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. offering partnership to u.n. in a postwar iraq the united states and some of its european partners argued intensely over the possibility of war against iraq .
their conflict may continue on the administration of the country after the war as well .

english-speaking news hounds interested in a german point of view from the country 's most-respected newsmagazine now have a new source for information - the new york times online . with little fanfare , the content of germany 's most-respected newsweekly , der spiegel , recently began appearing on the web site of america 's national newspaper of record , the new york times .
the internet outposts of both publishers - spiegel online and nytimes.com - began sharing stories a few weeks ago in a cross-pollination effort after controversy surrounding u.s. policy in iraq became a shared interest for germans and americans .
english speakers interested in the german point of view and germans whose english is good enough to read a new york times editorial can now be brought up to date at the click of a mouse .
" we said , ' why not translate at least the cover story in english and then put it on our site , " ' said matthias müller von blumencrone , editor in chief of spiegel online .
" then we had a second idea of finding a partner to trade this story with . "
that partner turned out to be nytimes.com.
about five weeks ago , the story-sharing began .
there is no financial aspect to the agreement .
international appeal is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush warriors spiegel online sends the new york times the magazine 's translated cover story , or whichever story is of broadest international appeal .
in return , spiegel online runs two or three general-interest stories from the times , but the lion 's share so far has been opinion pieces .
the latest spiegel stories featured on the new york times ' web site are an interview with former u.s. national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski and a feature on arabs from other nations who have volunteered to fight for iraq .
on the spiegel site , readers can find pulitzer prize-winning writer maureen dowd admonishing the bush administration not to turn the united states into another sparta or reminding congress , which recently rechristened french fries as " freedom fries , " that the capital city was designed by pierre-charles l 'enfant , a frenchman . the german publication does n't just pick what it thinks germans will like to read , however .
" the times editorial board is very mixed , " von blumencrone said .
" sometimes you read a piece and think , ' wow , how can they argue that ? '
but then , you know , it 's a widely made argument .
so let 's present it to our readers . "
another interesting aspect for germans is that " often the articles are very critical of bush .
then you know that the u.s. public is not 100 percent behind bush .
that 's something that is sometimes not very clear here , " von blumencrone says .
reader reaction is positive for the nytimes.com as well as spiegel online , the agreement is the latest of many .
epecially in the area of online news , content swapping is becoming ever more commonplace .
martin nisenholtz , nytimes.com ceo , notes that his company started first working with the financial times , then the british broadcasting corp. and now der spiegel .
" i hope we can continue to expand , " he adds .
the spiegel stories have gotten " a positive reaction , " nisenholtz said , but they also point up a limitation inherent in online media - and possibly a difference in the way germans and americans are used to digesting information .
" the spiegel articles are very long , written for magazine format , so the practical idea of reading them from a screen has its limitations , " he said .
new focus on germany ?
nonetheless , von blumencrone notes that there has been a good deal of interest in the german view .
spiegel stories on the times site have logged " up to 60,000 hits , which is n't much for a times story , but for us it 's a big number , " considering that the spiegel only has a small button on the right side of the screen in the international section of nytimes.com.
" but even then , people find it and appreciate it , " he said .
the agreement came into being based around the iraq conflict , " but who knows how long it will continue , " von blumencrone said .
" americans have an interest in the european position now , at least more than they did two years ago .
when it goes back to normal - normal being that most people in the u.s. are n't very interested in the german or european point of view - then we 'll see . "
but nisenholtz suggested that the deal should not be seen as a representation of a sudden leap in interest in the german point of view .
" speaking for the web site only , i do not think there has been a particular increased interest in german issues in recent months . ...
the diplomacy surrounding the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- , which of course involves germany , is an important part of the coverage .
but it would be wrong to say there is a particular focus on germany , " he said .

once the fighting stops , the new leadership of iraq - whoever it may be - will have to address the pressing issues of debt and reconstruction .
large oil revenues can provide only some of the relief . from berlin , the iraqi dissident kazem habib listens to the debate about postwar iraq - who will be the guiding force in the reconstruction of the country ?
the u.s.-led coalition that is fighting the war ?
or the united nations ?
but the economics professor knows that once these political questions are finally settled the international community will have to turn its attention to the numerous dollar-and-cents issues that litter the landscape much like the statues of saddam hussein scattered across the countryside .
" i think iraq needs about $ 400 billion to $ 500 billion to complete its reconstruction , " habib told deutsche welle .
" and it will not be a matter of one or two years .
we will need 10 to 15 years . "
legacy of war creates problems one of the primary reasons iraq will need such money lies in the war-pocked past of saddam 's iron rule .
" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .
u.s. seeks new iraqi leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed chalabi , a longtime iraqi exile who heads the iraqi national congress .
at this point , though , u.s. leaders are still focusing on ending the war and addressing the sticky political issues involved in creating an administration that could lead iraq toward this petro-dollar future .
as a first step in creating this administration , the united states is inviting more than 40 iraqi politicians to attend a saturday conference in southern iraq , said iraqi national congress leader ahmed chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the conference will be the first of a series of meetings that will culminate in a convention where a transitional government will be created , a spokesman for the u.s. state department said this week .
but the plan ran into immediate objections from one of the most important exile groups of iraqis , the supreme council for islamic revolution in iraq .
" we can not participate in a military government of the country , " said hamid el bajati , a spokesman for the group in london .
the u.s. reconstruction effort is being led by the retired lt. gen. jay garner , who answers to the commander of the coalition forces , u.s. army gen. tommy franks .
garner has been critcized by arab groups for his support of israel and by humanitarian organizations for his military past .
chalabi , too , is seen as a divisive figure in the u.s. plan for a postwar iraq .

" the damage in irak is massive , " habib said .
" we have had three wars : the iran-iraq war whose damage still has not been repaired .
then , there was the second gulf war , which was the worst because of the extensive bombing .
from an industrial and infrastructure point of view , we were actually thrown back to the start of the 20th century . "
iraq 's needs extend beyond these bricks-and-mortar issues , he said .
" we have debts of $ 450 billion , " habib said .
and that total could climb to $ 600 billion because of the latest war , he added .
" if that proves to be true , then we would not be able to start the reconstruction , " he said .
the united states and britain , the leaders of the coalition fighting to overthrow saddam , have pointed to the country 's huge oil reserves as a potential source of reconstruction funds .
but habib suggested the oil money would not be able to pay all of the bills .
" first of all , how can we achieve debt relief ?
because the iraqi people are not responsible for these debts .
it was the regime , " he said .
" second of all , how can you get new loans ?
from the country 's oil revenues , from arab countries and from abroad , international institutions or other developed countries ? "
most of oil industry undamaged the prospects that iraq will be able to earn those oil revenues appear bright .
instead of carrying out a scorched earth policy of burning oil wells like the one employed during the 1991 gulf war , iraqi forces left the country 's petroleum industry relatively untouched .
only a few of the 1,000 wells in southern iraq are burning , and coalition forces have secured many of them along with the ports of umm qasr and al faw .
production in northern iraq has been continuing as well , according the news service petroleum argus .
once the short-term problems associated with refitting the oil production facilities are finished , the country 's new government can look forward to an oil-filled future for the country , which already has the world 's second largest oil reserves behind saudi arabia .
" there is a lot of oil yet to be discovered in iraq , " said fadhil chalabi of the center for global energy studies in london .
chalabi said that according to one study " there could be 200 billion barrels of undiscovered reserves to go along with the 112 billion barrels whose existence is already known . "
such capacity could elevate iraq to the same status as saudi arabia on the oil market , chalabi said .
u.s. seeks new iraqi leadership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmed chalabi , a longtime iraqi exile who heads the iraqi national congress .
at this point , though , u.s. leaders are still focusing on ending the war and addressing the sticky political issues involved in creating an administration that could lead iraq toward this petro-dollar future .
as a first step in creating this administration , the united states is inviting more than 40 iraqi politicians to attend a saturday conference in southern iraq , said iraqi national congress leader ahmed chalabi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the conference will be the first of a series of meetings that will culminate in a convention where a transitional government will be created , a spokesman for the u.s. state department said this week .

'
english-speaking news hounds interested in a german point of view from the country 's most-respected newsmagazine now have a new source for information - the new york times online . with little fanfare , the content of germany 's most-respected newsweekly , der spiegel , recently began appearing on the web site of america 's national newspaper of record , the new york times .
the internet outposts of both publishers - spiegel online and nytimes.com - began sharing stories a few weeks ago in a cross-pollination effort after controversy surrounding u.s. policy in iraq became a shared interest for germans and americans .
english speakers interested in the german point of view and germans whose english is good enough to read a new york times editorial can now be brought up to date at the click of a mouse .
" we said , ' why not translate at least the cover story in english and then put it on our site , " ' said matthias müller von blumencrone , editor in chief of spiegel online .
" then we had a second idea of finding a partner to trade this story with . "
that partner turned out to be nytimes.com.
about five weeks ago , the story-sharing began .
there is no financial aspect to the agreement .
international appeal is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush warriors spiegel online sends the new york times the magazine 's translated cover story , or whichever story is of broadest international appeal .
in return , spiegel online runs two or three general-interest stories from the times , but the lion 's share so far has been opinion pieces .
the latest spiegel stories featured on the new york times ' web site are an interview with former u.s. national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski and a feature on arabs from other nations who have volunteered to fight for iraq .
on the spiegel site , readers can find pulitzer prize-winning writer maureen dowd admonishing the bush administration not to turn the united states into another sparta or reminding congress , which recently rechristened french fries as " freedom fries , " that the capital city was designed by pierre-charles l 'enfant , a frenchman . the german publication does n't just pick what it thinks germans will like to read , however .
" the times editorial board is very mixed , " von blumencrone said .
" sometimes you read a piece and think , ' wow , how can they argue that ? '
but then , you know , it 's a widely made argument .
so let 's present it to our readers . "
another interesting aspect for germans is that " often the articles are very critical of bush .
then you know that the u.s. public is not 100 percent behind bush .
that 's something that is sometimes not very clear here , " von blumencrone says .
reader reaction is positive for the nytimes.com as well as spiegel online , the agreement is the latest of many .
epecially in the area of online news , content swapping is becoming ever more commonplace .
martin nisenholtz , nytimes.com ceo , notes that his company started first working with the financial times , then the british broadcasting corp. and now der spiegel .
" i hope we can continue to expand , " he adds .
the spiegel stories have gotten " a positive reaction , " nisenholtz said , but they also point up a limitation inherent in online media - and possibly a difference in the way germans and americans are used to digesting information .
" the spiegel articles are very long , written for magazine format , so the practical idea of reading them from a screen has its limitations , " he said .
new focus on germany ?
nonetheless , von blumencrone notes that there has been a good deal of interest in the german view .
spiegel stories on the times site have logged " up to 60,000 hits , which is n't much for a times story , but for us it 's a big number , " considering that the spiegel only has a small button on the right side of the screen in the international section of nytimes.com.
" but even then , people find it and appreciate it , " he said .
the agreement came into being based around the iraq conflict , " but who knows how long it will continue , " von blumencrone said .
" americans have an interest in the european position now , at least more than they did two years ago .
when it goes back to normal - normal being that most people in the u.s. are n't very interested in the german or european point of view - then we 'll see . "
but nisenholtz suggested that the deal should not be seen as a representation of a sudden leap in interest in the german point of view .
" speaking for the web site only , i do not think there has been a particular increased interest in german issues in recent months . ...
the diplomacy surrounding the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- , which of course involves germany , is an important part of the coverage .
but it would be wrong to say there is a particular focus on germany , " he said .

on the spiegel site , readers can find pulitzer prize-winning writer maureen dowd admonishing the bush administration not to turn the united states into another sparta or reminding congress , which recently rechristened french fries as " freedom fries , " that the capital city was designed by pierre-charles l 'enfant , a frenchman . the german publication does n't just pick what it thinks germans will like to read , however .
" the times editorial board is very mixed , " von blumencrone said .
" sometimes you read a piece and think , ' wow , how can they argue that ? '
but then , you know , it 's a widely made argument .
so let 's present it to our readers . "
another interesting aspect for germans is that " often the articles are very critical of bush .
then you know that the u.s. public is not 100 percent behind bush .
that 's something that is sometimes not very clear here , " von blumencrone says .
reader reaction is positive for the nytimes.com as well as spiegel online , the agreement is the latest of many .
epecially in the area of online news , content swapping is becoming ever more commonplace .
martin nisenholtz , nytimes.com ceo , notes that his company started first working with the financial times , then the british broadcasting corp. and now der spiegel .
" i hope we can continue to expand , " he adds .
the spiegel stories have gotten " a positive reaction , " nisenholtz said , but they also point up a limitation inherent in online media - and possibly a difference in the way germans and americans are used to digesting information .
" the spiegel articles are very long , written for magazine format , so the practical idea of reading them from a screen has its limitations , " he said .
new focus on germany ?
nonetheless , von blumencrone notes that there has been a good deal of interest in the german view .
spiegel stories on the times site have logged " up to 60,000 hits , which is n't much for a times story , but for us it 's a big number , " considering that the spiegel only has a small button on the right side of the screen in the international section of nytimes.com.
" but even then , people find it and appreciate it , " he said .
the agreement came into being based around the iraq conflict , " but who knows how long it will continue , " von blumencrone said .
" americans have an interest in the european position now , at least more than they did two years ago .
when it goes back to normal - normal being that most people in the u.s. are n't very interested in the german or european point of view - then we 'll see . "
but nisenholtz suggested that the deal should not be seen as a representation of a sudden leap in interest in the german point of view .
" speaking for the web site only , i do not think there has been a particular increased interest in german issues in recent months . ...
the diplomacy surrounding the war -lrb- in iraq -rrb- , which of course involves germany , is an important part of the coverage .
but it would be wrong to say there is a particular focus on germany , " he said .

scotland 's foster children are being moved around too much , causing disruption and instability , according to a report .
the study , entitled voices from care , is based on a survey by the fostering network which found that almost two thirds of affected children have lived in three or more foster homes .
and 10 % had been moved more than 10 times while in foster care .
the survey also found that fostered children are not being given enough information about their moves .
almost a quarter said they had no knowledge of where they were being moved to , while 30 % were offered no details about the family they were moving in with .
local authorities must work to give these children the support , training and recognition they need and deserve kausar karim , fostering network key findings of the research will be presented at the fostering network 's young people 's national conference in edinburgh on friday .
kausar karim , of the fostering network in scotland , said : " this new research clearly highlights the need for more investment in foster care , to help local authorities increase the pool of carers and reduce the number of times each child is moved thereby limiting disruption to their lives .
" the report makes clear that fostered children and young people continue to say that their voices are not being heard in decisions made about their lives .
" it is essential that they should have greater involvement before they are moved from home to home .
" local authorities must also do more to help fostered children keep in closer contact with family and friends while more regular visits from social workers can help prevent placement breakdown .
when you 're in foster care you can basically turn round and say i 've got a mum and dad former foster child " the role of sons and daughters of foster carers is also being undervalued .
" local authorities must work to give these children the support , training and recognition they need and deserve . "
angela young grew up in foster care .
she said : most kids in care feel different because they do n't have a mum or dad .
" most kids in school tease them - ' you dont have a mum or day , you 're different ' .
" when you 're in foster care you can basically turn round and say i 've got a mum and dad . "
there are more than 4,500 fostered children living with around 2,200 foster families in scotland .
the fostering network aims to ensure they receive the highest standards of care possible .
the charity 's survey is based on responses from 111 children and young people in foster care and 102 sons and daughters of foster carers aged four and up .
