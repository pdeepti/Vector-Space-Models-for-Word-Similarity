pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .
the market value of bayer , one of germany 's largest companies , has shrunk by some € 8 billion . on the defensive bayer executives deny that they had any prior knowledge of lipobay 's possible dangers before taking the drug off the market .
attorneys for the company say documents brought forward by plaintiffs have been presented out of context and are misleading . in an attempt to slow the current stock market blood-letting , bayer took out full-page ads in german newspapers on friday .
in them , it defended its actions and said the current stock valuation did not accurately reflect the health of the company and that stockholders had fallen victim to what bayer called " cheap propaganda . " " despite the difficult economic and even global political situation right now , we believe we can put the company back on a path to success , " the ad read . but the litigation in the u.s. clearly has bayer worried , particularly because of the large court settlements that have become common in american courts .
a statement this week by werner wenning , bayer 's chairman , sent stocks tumbling further when he admitted that the company might have to make provisions for liability arising from lipobay .
some estimates put that liability as high at $ 10 billion . andreas theisen of west lb panmure in frankfurt told the financial times that he agreed with bayer that the market reaction to the crisis has not been justified . " however , no one is able to quantify the potential impact , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayer sees no sign of recovery after posting second-quarter results that were well below analysts ’ expectations , the pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant said it saw no reason to expect a turnaround before the end of 2002 .
bayer faces lawsuit munich lawyer michael witti , who successfully sued on behalf of nazi-era slave laborers , will join a lawsuit filed on behalf of those who suffered from side effects of bayer 's cholesterol-reducing drug baycol .

victims of the nazi regime in austria may now have grounds for further compensation . it 's long overdue , say critics .
earlier this week , the austrian historical commission , established for the documentation of the extent of austrian complicity in nazi crimes , delivered its final report .
the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .
they didn ’ t switch to an active policy of economic restitution until 1955 , and only then under strong pressure from the allies . restitution has been held up by the austrians ’ difficulty in coming to terms with their past .
after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .
as part of the so-called arianization law , everything belonging to jews – shops , cars , land , musical instruments – was expropriated .
in vienna alone , 60,000 apartments were confiscated .
the euthanasia program ordered the deaths of thousands of handicapped people , and their belongings were often claimed by the doctors who oversaw their death .
“ they were robbed - their valuables became a resource for the doctors - this is a particularly grisly tale ” jabloner said . of the 200,000 jews living in vienna before 1938 , only 1,000 survived .
what became of their belongings has hardly been addressed , and only now - with the publication of this report - can austria and victims begin the careful work of determining a fair deal . according to jabloner , the new findings may help victims to successfully seek further compensation .
but he also has strong words of warning for those hoping to close this chapter in history - vigilance is needed , he says . " we all know the prejudices that persist ; how widespread the belief is that the jews didn ’ t have to pay any taxes after 1945 , that there were only rich jews in austria prior to 1938 , ” jabloner said .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . after months of debate , new york officials chose the structure by berlin-based architect daniel libeskind wednesday night and made the official announcement on thursday .
libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan . " with the selection of the team of studio daniel libeskind we have accomplished all three objectives and in doing so we take a significant step toward fulfilling our vision , " he said at a news conference announcing the decision . libeskind 's design , titled " memory foundations " features a tower 1,776-foot -lrb- 541 meters -rrb- high that ends in a multi-story garden .
the tower , which would be among the world 's tallest structures , is surrounded by a series of interconnecting public pathways and spaces , including a square perfectly positioned to fill with light between 8:46 a.m. when the first plane hit and 10:28 a.m. when the second tower fell , every sept .

seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .

" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .
new york city officials said that the design will undergo some refinement as various civic groups and relatives of victims of the attacks jostle for a say in what fills the empty space .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2003 play sheds light on dark east german secret großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the perfect world of marion -lrb- played by actress anna-maria kuricová -rrb- comes crashing down when she learns the terrible truth of her adoption .
a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .
" i was scared to hear and see it -lrb- the play -rrb- in my mother tongue , i was afraid it would be too close .
i didn ’ t even attend the preview , just the opening night because i decided to just fold away the experience of the past five years and open a new page and see what they did with it , " she says .
ahrens returns to her favorite theme of time .
" there are still huge wounds and scars on both sides , i don ’ t think the two germanys have really grown together , but i have a feeling from the reactions to the play , that at least there ’ s a sort of opening up , " she says .

victims of the nazi regime in austria may now have grounds for further compensation . it 's long overdue , say critics .
earlier this week , the austrian historical commission , established for the documentation of the extent of austrian complicity in nazi crimes , delivered its final report .
the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .
they didn ’ t switch to an active policy of economic restitution until 1955 , and only then under strong pressure from the allies . restitution has been held up by the austrians ’ difficulty in coming to terms with their past .
after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .
as part of the so-called arianization law , everything belonging to jews – shops , cars , land , musical instruments – was expropriated .
in vienna alone , 60,000 apartments were confiscated .
the euthanasia program ordered the deaths of thousands of handicapped people , and their belongings were often claimed by the doctors who oversaw their death .
“ they were robbed - their valuables became a resource for the doctors - this is a particularly grisly tale ” jabloner said . of the 200,000 jews living in vienna before 1938 , only 1,000 survived .
what became of their belongings has hardly been addressed , and only now - with the publication of this report - can austria and victims begin the careful work of determining a fair deal . according to jabloner , the new findings may help victims to successfully seek further compensation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2003 play sheds light on dark east german secret großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the perfect world of marion -lrb- played by actress anna-maria kuricová -rrb- comes crashing down when she learns the terrible truth of her adoption .
a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .
" i was scared to hear and see it -lrb- the play -rrb- in my mother tongue , i was afraid it would be too close .
i didn ’ t even attend the preview , just the opening night because i decided to just fold away the experience of the past five years and open a new page and see what they did with it , " she says .
ahrens returns to her favorite theme of time .
" there are still huge wounds and scars on both sides , i don ’ t think the two germanys have really grown together , but i have a feeling from the reactions to the play , that at least there ’ s a sort of opening up , " she says .

play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .
" i was scared to hear and see it -lrb- the play -rrb- in my mother tongue , i was afraid it would be too close .
i didn ’ t even attend the preview , just the opening night because i decided to just fold away the experience of the past five years and open a new page and see what they did with it , " she says .
ahrens returns to her favorite theme of time .
" there are still huge wounds and scars on both sides , i don ’ t think the two germanys have really grown together , but i have a feeling from the reactions to the play , that at least there ’ s a sort of opening up , " she says .

a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.02.2003 drug scandal batters bayer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lipobay 's side effects have become a serious fiscal health issue for bayer .
pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .
the market value of bayer , one of germany 's largest companies , has shrunk by some € 8 billion . on the defensive bayer executives deny that they had any prior knowledge of lipobay 's possible dangers before taking the drug off the market .
attorneys for the company say documents brought forward by plaintiffs have been presented out of context and are misleading . in an attempt to slow the current stock market blood-letting , bayer took out full-page ads in german newspapers on friday .
in them , it defended its actions and said the current stock valuation did not accurately reflect the health of the company and that stockholders had fallen victim to what bayer called " cheap propaganda . " " despite the difficult economic and even global political situation right now , we believe we can put the company back on a path to success , " the ad read . but the litigation in the u.s. clearly has bayer worried , particularly because of the large court settlements that have become common in american courts .
a statement this week by werner wenning , bayer 's chairman , sent stocks tumbling further when he admitted that the company might have to make provisions for liability arising from lipobay .
some estimates put that liability as high at $ 10 billion . andreas theisen of west lb panmure in frankfurt told the financial times that he agreed with bayer that the market reaction to the crisis has not been justified . " however , no one is able to quantify the potential impact , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayer sees no sign of recovery after posting second-quarter results that were well below analysts ’ expectations , the pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant said it saw no reason to expect a turnaround before the end of 2002 .
bayer faces lawsuit munich lawyer michael witti , who successfully sued on behalf of nazi-era slave laborers , will join a lawsuit filed on behalf of those who suffered from side effects of bayer 's cholesterol-reducing drug baycol .

pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .
the market value of bayer , one of germany 's largest companies , has shrunk by some € 8 billion . on the defensive bayer executives deny that they had any prior knowledge of lipobay 's possible dangers before taking the drug off the market .
attorneys for the company say documents brought forward by plaintiffs have been presented out of context and are misleading . in an attempt to slow the current stock market blood-letting , bayer took out full-page ads in german newspapers on friday .
in them , it defended its actions and said the current stock valuation did not accurately reflect the health of the company and that stockholders had fallen victim to what bayer called " cheap propaganda . " " despite the difficult economic and even global political situation right now , we believe we can put the company back on a path to success , " the ad read . but the litigation in the u.s. clearly has bayer worried , particularly because of the large court settlements that have become common in american courts .
a statement this week by werner wenning , bayer 's chairman , sent stocks tumbling further when he admitted that the company might have to make provisions for liability arising from lipobay .
some estimates put that liability as high at $ 10 billion . andreas theisen of west lb panmure in frankfurt told the financial times that he agreed with bayer that the market reaction to the crisis has not been justified .

a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .
" i was scared to hear and see it -lrb- the play -rrb- in my mother tongue , i was afraid it would be too close .
i didn ’ t even attend the preview , just the opening night because i decided to just fold away the experience of the past five years and open a new page and see what they did with it , " she says .
ahrens returns to her favorite theme of time .
" there are still huge wounds and scars on both sides , i don ’ t think the two germanys have really grown together , but i have a feeling from the reactions to the play , that at least there ’ s a sort of opening up , " she says .

the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .
" i was scared to hear and see it -lrb- the play -rrb- in my mother tongue , i was afraid it would be too close .
i didn ’ t even attend the preview , just the opening night because i decided to just fold away the experience of the past five years and open a new page and see what they did with it , " she says .
ahrens returns to her favorite theme of time .
" there are still huge wounds and scars on both sides , i don ’ t think the two germanys have really grown together , but i have a feeling from the reactions to the play , that at least there ’ s a sort of opening up , " she says .

a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .

outside in the courtyard , he lights up a marlboro cigarette and pops open a coke while catching up with his fellow students . american products are simply a part of life for most german young people and the thought of boycotting them seems absurd to oliver , even though he and most of germany 's students disagree profoundly with the iraq policy of the bush administration .

" millions of people are marching in the streets , but it 's as if the americans do n't want to see that . " a survey conducted by the polis institute showed that almost 80 percent of the 14 to 19 year-olds want to participate in demonstrations against a possible war in iraq .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . after months of debate , new york officials chose the structure by berlin-based architect daniel libeskind wednesday night and made the official announcement on thursday .
libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan . " with the selection of the team of studio daniel libeskind we have accomplished all three objectives and in doing so we take a significant step toward fulfilling our vision , " he said at a news conference announcing the decision . libeskind 's design , titled " memory foundations " features a tower 1,776-foot -lrb- 541 meters -rrb- high that ends in a multi-story garden .
the tower , which would be among the world 's tallest structures , is surrounded by a series of interconnecting public pathways and spaces , including a square perfectly positioned to fill with light between 8:46 a.m. when the first plane hit and 10:28 a.m. when the second tower fell , every sept .
11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this one of the proposed designs for the rebuilding of new york 's world trade center , by studio daniel libeskind , presented in new york wednesday dec .
18 , 2002 .
seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .
the plot of land is owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey , but new york developer larry silverstein owns the lease to build offices and commercial stores on the site . " he 's got a right to rebuild and an obligation to rebuild , " louis tomson , president of the lower manhattan development corporation , which ran the selection process said of silverstein .
" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .
new york city officials said that the design will undergo some refinement as various civic groups and relatives of victims of the attacks jostle for a say in what fills the empty space .
building is only expected to begin in 2005 , at the earliest . libeskind 's big break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american architect daniel libeskind smiles during a tour for journalists inside the new jewish museum in berlin friday , january 22 , 1999 .
the museum designed as a destroyed star of david will be opened this weekend .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- the selection is nevertheless a huge coup for libeskind .
the architect -lrb- photo -rrb- has won acclaim for his addition to the jewish museum in berlin and his imperial war museum in manchester , great britain . the 57-year-old architect was born in postwar poland and travelled to the united states with the intention of studying music .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . after months of debate , new york officials chose the structure by berlin-based architect daniel libeskind wednesday night and made the official announcement on thursday .
libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan . " with the selection of the team of studio daniel libeskind we have accomplished all three objectives and in doing so we take a significant step toward fulfilling our vision , " he said at a news conference announcing the decision . libeskind 's design , titled " memory foundations " features a tower 1,776-foot -lrb- 541 meters -rrb- high that ends in a multi-story garden .
the tower , which would be among the world 's tallest structures , is surrounded by a series of interconnecting public pathways and spaces , including a square perfectly positioned to fill with light between 8:46 a.m. when the first plane hit and 10:28 a.m. when the second tower fell , every sept .

seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .
the plot of land is owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey , but new york developer larry silverstein owns the lease to build offices and commercial stores on the site . " he 's got a right to rebuild and an obligation to rebuild , " louis tomson , president of the lower manhattan development corporation , which ran the selection process said of silverstein .
" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .
new york city officials said that the design will undergo some refinement as various civic groups and relatives of victims of the attacks jostle for a say in what fills the empty space .
building is only expected to begin in 2005 , at the earliest . libeskind 's big break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american architect daniel libeskind smiles during a tour for journalists inside the new jewish museum in berlin friday , january 22 , 1999 .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . after months of debate , new york officials chose the structure by berlin-based architect daniel libeskind wednesday night and made the official announcement on thursday .
libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan . " with the selection of the team of studio daniel libeskind we have accomplished all three objectives and in doing so we take a significant step toward fulfilling our vision , " he said at a news conference announcing the decision . libeskind 's design , titled " memory foundations " features a tower 1,776-foot -lrb- 541 meters -rrb- high that ends in a multi-story garden .
the tower , which would be among the world 's tallest structures , is surrounded by a series of interconnecting public pathways and spaces , including a square perfectly positioned to fill with light between 8:46 a.m. when the first plane hit and 10:28 a.m. when the second tower fell , every sept .
11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this one of the proposed designs for the rebuilding of new york 's world trade center , by studio daniel libeskind , presented in new york wednesday dec .
18 , 2002 .
seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .
the plot of land is owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey , but new york developer larry silverstein owns the lease to build offices and commercial stores on the site . " he 's got a right to rebuild and an obligation to rebuild , " louis tomson , president of the lower manhattan development corporation , which ran the selection process said of silverstein .
" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .
new york city officials said that the design will undergo some refinement as various civic groups and relatives of victims of the attacks jostle for a say in what fills the empty space .
building is only expected to begin in 2005 , at the earliest . libeskind 's big break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american architect daniel libeskind smiles during a tour for journalists inside the new jewish museum in berlin friday , january 22 , 1999 .
the museum designed as a destroyed star of david will be opened this weekend .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- the selection is nevertheless a huge coup for libeskind .
the architect -lrb- photo -rrb- has won acclaim for his addition to the jewish museum in berlin and his imperial war museum in manchester , great britain . the 57-year-old architect was born in postwar poland and travelled to the united states with the intention of studying music .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture . " i arrived by ship to new york as a teenager , an immigrant , and like millions of others before me , my first sight was the statue of liberty and the amazing skyline of manhattan , " he wrote in the opening of a description of his design .
" i have never forgotten that sight or what it stands for .
this is what this project is all about . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interview : wtc design finalist daniel libeskind dw-world interviews the architect about his design .

pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .
the market value of bayer , one of germany 's largest companies , has shrunk by some € 8 billion . on the defensive bayer executives deny that they had any prior knowledge of lipobay 's possible dangers before taking the drug off the market .
attorneys for the company say documents brought forward by plaintiffs have been presented out of context and are misleading . in an attempt to slow the current stock market blood-letting , bayer took out full-page ads in german newspapers on friday .
in them , it defended its actions and said the current stock valuation did not accurately reflect the health of the company and that stockholders had fallen victim to what bayer called " cheap propaganda . " " despite the difficult economic and even global political situation right now , we believe we can put the company back on a path to success , " the ad read . but the litigation in the u.s. clearly has bayer worried , particularly because of the large court settlements that have become common in american courts .
a statement this week by werner wenning , bayer 's chairman , sent stocks tumbling further when he admitted that the company might have to make provisions for liability arising from lipobay .
some estimates put that liability as high at $ 10 billion . andreas theisen of west lb panmure in frankfurt told the financial times that he agreed with bayer that the market reaction to the crisis has not been justified .

victims of the nazi regime in austria may now have grounds for further compensation . it 's long overdue , say critics .
earlier this week , the austrian historical commission , established for the documentation of the extent of austrian complicity in nazi crimes , delivered its final report .
the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .
they didn ’ t switch to an active policy of economic restitution until 1955 , and only then under strong pressure from the allies . restitution has been held up by the austrians ’ difficulty in coming to terms with their past .
after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .
as part of the so-called arianization law , everything belonging to jews – shops , cars , land , musical instruments – was expropriated .
in vienna alone , 60,000 apartments were confiscated .
the euthanasia program ordered the deaths of thousands of handicapped people , and their belongings were often claimed by the doctors who oversaw their death .
“ they were robbed - their valuables became a resource for the doctors - this is a particularly grisly tale ” jabloner said . of the 200,000 jews living in vienna before 1938 , only 1,000 survived .
what became of their belongings has hardly been addressed , and only now - with the publication of this report - can austria and victims begin the careful work of determining a fair deal . according to jabloner , the new findings may help victims to successfully seek further compensation .
but he also has strong words of warning for those hoping to close this chapter in history - vigilance is needed , he says . " we all know the prejudices that persist ; how widespread the belief is that the jews didn ’ t have to pay any taxes after 1945 , that there were only rich jews in austria prior to 1938 , ” jabloner said .

a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .
" i was scared to hear and see it -lrb- the play -rrb- in my mother tongue , i was afraid it would be too close .
i didn ’ t even attend the preview , just the opening night because i decided to just fold away the experience of the past five years and open a new page and see what they did with it , " she says .
ahrens returns to her favorite theme of time .
" there are still huge wounds and scars on both sides , i don ’ t think the two germanys have really grown together , but i have a feeling from the reactions to the play , that at least there ’ s a sort of opening up , " she says .

victims of the nazi regime in austria may now have grounds for further compensation . it 's long overdue , say critics .
earlier this week , the austrian historical commission , established for the documentation of the extent of austrian complicity in nazi crimes , delivered its final report .
the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .
they didn ’ t switch to an active policy of economic restitution until 1955 , and only then under strong pressure from the allies . restitution has been held up by the austrians ’ difficulty in coming to terms with their past .
after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .
as part of the so-called arianization law , everything belonging to jews – shops , cars , land , musical instruments – was expropriated .
in vienna alone , 60,000 apartments were confiscated .
the euthanasia program ordered the deaths of thousands of handicapped people , and their belongings were often claimed by the doctors who oversaw their death .
“ they were robbed - their valuables became a resource for the doctors - this is a particularly grisly tale ” jabloner said . of the 200,000 jews living in vienna before 1938 , only 1,000 survived .
what became of their belongings has hardly been addressed , and only now - with the publication of this report - can austria and victims begin the careful work of determining a fair deal . according to jabloner , the new findings may help victims to successfully seek further compensation .
but he also has strong words of warning for those hoping to close this chapter in history - vigilance is needed , he says . " we all know the prejudices that persist ; how widespread the belief is that the jews didn ’ t have to pay any taxes after 1945 , that there were only rich jews in austria prior to 1938 , ” jabloner said .

victims of the nazi regime in austria may now have grounds for further compensation . it 's long overdue , say critics .
earlier this week , the austrian historical commission , established for the documentation of the extent of austrian complicity in nazi crimes , delivered its final report .
the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .
they didn ’ t switch to an active policy of economic restitution until 1955 , and only then under strong pressure from the allies . restitution has been held up by the austrians ’ difficulty in coming to terms with their past .
after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.02.2003 drug scandal batters bayer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lipobay 's side effects have become a serious fiscal health issue for bayer .
pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .
the market value of bayer , one of germany 's largest companies , has shrunk by some € 8 billion . on the defensive bayer executives deny that they had any prior knowledge of lipobay 's possible dangers before taking the drug off the market .
attorneys for the company say documents brought forward by plaintiffs have been presented out of context and are misleading . in an attempt to slow the current stock market blood-letting , bayer took out full-page ads in german newspapers on friday .
in them , it defended its actions and said the current stock valuation did not accurately reflect the health of the company and that stockholders had fallen victim to what bayer called " cheap propaganda . " " despite the difficult economic and even global political situation right now , we believe we can put the company back on a path to success , " the ad read . but the litigation in the u.s. clearly has bayer worried , particularly because of the large court settlements that have become common in american courts .
a statement this week by werner wenning , bayer 's chairman , sent stocks tumbling further when he admitted that the company might have to make provisions for liability arising from lipobay .
some estimates put that liability as high at $ 10 billion . andreas theisen of west lb panmure in frankfurt told the financial times that he agreed with bayer that the market reaction to the crisis has not been justified . " however , no one is able to quantify the potential impact , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayer sees no sign of recovery after posting second-quarter results that were well below analysts ’ expectations , the pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant said it saw no reason to expect a turnaround before the end of 2002 .
bayer faces lawsuit munich lawyer michael witti , who successfully sued on behalf of nazi-era slave laborers , will join a lawsuit filed on behalf of those who suffered from side effects of bayer 's cholesterol-reducing drug baycol .

libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan . " with the selection of the team of studio daniel libeskind we have accomplished all three objectives and in doing so we take a significant step toward fulfilling our vision , " he said at a news conference announcing the decision . libeskind 's design , titled " memory foundations " features a tower 1,776-foot -lrb- 541 meters -rrb- high that ends in a multi-story garden .

seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .

" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .
new york city officials said that the design will undergo some refinement as various civic groups and relatives of victims of the attacks jostle for a say in what fills the empty space .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.02.2003 drug scandal batters bayer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lipobay 's side effects have become a serious fiscal health issue for bayer .
pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .
the market value of bayer , one of germany 's largest companies , has shrunk by some € 8 billion . on the defensive bayer executives deny that they had any prior knowledge of lipobay 's possible dangers before taking the drug off the market .
attorneys for the company say documents brought forward by plaintiffs have been presented out of context and are misleading . in an attempt to slow the current stock market blood-letting , bayer took out full-page ads in german newspapers on friday .
in them , it defended its actions and said the current stock valuation did not accurately reflect the health of the company and that stockholders had fallen victim to what bayer called " cheap propaganda . " " despite the difficult economic and even global political situation right now , we believe we can put the company back on a path to success , " the ad read . but the litigation in the u.s. clearly has bayer worried , particularly because of the large court settlements that have become common in american courts .
a statement this week by werner wenning , bayer 's chairman , sent stocks tumbling further when he admitted that the company might have to make provisions for liability arising from lipobay .
some estimates put that liability as high at $ 10 billion . andreas theisen of west lb panmure in frankfurt told the financial times that he agreed with bayer that the market reaction to the crisis has not been justified . " however , no one is able to quantify the potential impact , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayer sees no sign of recovery after posting second-quarter results that were well below analysts ’ expectations , the pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant said it saw no reason to expect a turnaround before the end of 2002 .
bayer faces lawsuit munich lawyer michael witti , who successfully sued on behalf of nazi-era slave laborers , will join a lawsuit filed on behalf of those who suffered from side effects of bayer 's cholesterol-reducing drug baycol .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . after months of debate , new york officials chose the structure by berlin-based architect daniel libeskind wednesday night and made the official announcement on thursday .
libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan . " with the selection of the team of studio daniel libeskind we have accomplished all three objectives and in doing so we take a significant step toward fulfilling our vision , " he said at a news conference announcing the decision . libeskind 's design , titled " memory foundations " features a tower 1,776-foot -lrb- 541 meters -rrb- high that ends in a multi-story garden .
the tower , which would be among the world 's tallest structures , is surrounded by a series of interconnecting public pathways and spaces , including a square perfectly positioned to fill with light between 8:46 a.m. when the first plane hit and 10:28 a.m. when the second tower fell , every sept .
11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this one of the proposed designs for the rebuilding of new york 's world trade center , by studio daniel libeskind , presented in new york wednesday dec .
18 , 2002 .
seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .
the plot of land is owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey , but new york developer larry silverstein owns the lease to build offices and commercial stores on the site . " he 's got a right to rebuild and an obligation to rebuild , " louis tomson , president of the lower manhattan development corporation , which ran the selection process said of silverstein .
" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .
new york city officials said that the design will undergo some refinement as various civic groups and relatives of victims of the attacks jostle for a say in what fills the empty space .
building is only expected to begin in 2005 , at the earliest . libeskind 's big break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american architect daniel libeskind smiles during a tour for journalists inside the new jewish museum in berlin friday , january 22 , 1999 .

-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- the selection is nevertheless a huge coup for libeskind .
the architect -lrb- photo -rrb- has won acclaim for his addition to the jewish museum in berlin and his imperial war museum in manchester , great britain . the 57-year-old architect was born in postwar poland and travelled to the united states with the intention of studying music .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture . " i arrived by ship to new york as a teenager , an immigrant , and like millions of others before me , my first sight was the statue of liberty and the amazing skyline of manhattan , " he wrote in the opening of a description of his design .

a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . after months of debate , new york officials chose the structure by berlin-based architect daniel libeskind wednesday night and made the official announcement on thursday .
libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan . " with the selection of the team of studio daniel libeskind we have accomplished all three objectives and in doing so we take a significant step toward fulfilling our vision , " he said at a news conference announcing the decision . libeskind 's design , titled " memory foundations " features a tower 1,776-foot -lrb- 541 meters -rrb- high that ends in a multi-story garden .
the tower , which would be among the world 's tallest structures , is surrounded by a series of interconnecting public pathways and spaces , including a square perfectly positioned to fill with light between 8:46 a.m. when the first plane hit and 10:28 a.m. when the second tower fell , every sept .

18 , 2002 .
seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .
the plot of land is owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey , but new york developer larry silverstein owns the lease to build offices and commercial stores on the site . " he 's got a right to rebuild and an obligation to rebuild , " louis tomson , president of the lower manhattan development corporation , which ran the selection process said of silverstein .
" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .
new york city officials said that the design will undergo some refinement as various civic groups and relatives of victims of the attacks jostle for a say in what fills the empty space .
building is only expected to begin in 2005 , at the earliest . libeskind 's big break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american architect daniel libeskind smiles during a tour for journalists inside the new jewish museum in berlin friday , january 22 , 1999 .
the museum designed as a destroyed star of david will be opened this weekend .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- the selection is nevertheless a huge coup for libeskind .
the architect -lrb- photo -rrb- has won acclaim for his addition to the jewish museum in berlin and his imperial war museum in manchester , great britain . the 57-year-old architect was born in postwar poland and travelled to the united states with the intention of studying music .

" i arrived by ship to new york as a teenager , an immigrant , and like millions of others before me , my first sight was the statue of liberty and the amazing skyline of manhattan , " he wrote in the opening of a description of his design .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.02.2003 drug scandal batters bayer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lipobay 's side effects have become a serious fiscal health issue for bayer .
pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .
the market value of bayer , one of germany 's largest companies , has shrunk by some € 8 billion . on the defensive bayer executives deny that they had any prior knowledge of lipobay 's possible dangers before taking the drug off the market .
attorneys for the company say documents brought forward by plaintiffs have been presented out of context and are misleading . in an attempt to slow the current stock market blood-letting , bayer took out full-page ads in german newspapers on friday .
in them , it defended its actions and said the current stock valuation did not accurately reflect the health of the company and that stockholders had fallen victim to what bayer called " cheap propaganda . " " despite the difficult economic and even global political situation right now , we believe we can put the company back on a path to success , " the ad read . but the litigation in the u.s. clearly has bayer worried , particularly because of the large court settlements that have become common in american courts .
a statement this week by werner wenning , bayer 's chairman , sent stocks tumbling further when he admitted that the company might have to make provisions for liability arising from lipobay .
some estimates put that liability as high at $ 10 billion . andreas theisen of west lb panmure in frankfurt told the financial times that he agreed with bayer that the market reaction to the crisis has not been justified . " however , no one is able to quantify the potential impact , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayer sees no sign of recovery after posting second-quarter results that were well below analysts ’ expectations , the pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant said it saw no reason to expect a turnaround before the end of 2002 .
bayer faces lawsuit munich lawyer michael witti , who successfully sued on behalf of nazi-era slave laborers , will join a lawsuit filed on behalf of those who suffered from side effects of bayer 's cholesterol-reducing drug baycol .

a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .

strained relations between the united states and germany have some saying anti-americanism is rising .
but among young germans there 's a difference between opposing the bush administration and being anti-american . before 19-year-old oliver joins his friends between classes at his high school in cologne , he pulls on his levi 's jeans jacket and makes sure his nike tennis shoes are smudge-free .
outside in the courtyard , he lights up a marlboro cigarette and pops open a coke while catching up with his fellow students . american products are simply a part of life for most german young people and the thought of boycotting them seems absurd to oliver , even though he and most of germany 's students disagree profoundly with the iraq policy of the bush administration . " i think you could settle the -lrb- iraq -rrb- situation differently .
and you see that in all the demonstrations all over the world , " he said .
" millions of people are marching in the streets , but it 's as if the americans do n't want to see that . " a survey conducted by the polis institute showed that almost 80 percent of the 14 to 19 year-olds want to participate in demonstrations against a possible war in iraq .
thousands have already hit the streets in protest , including many of the students at oliver 's school , the kreuzgasse gymnasium . " what do i think of the bush administration ?
not much , " said one young woman .

a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .
" i was scared to hear and see it -lrb- the play -rrb- in my mother tongue , i was afraid it would be too close .
i didn ’ t even attend the preview , just the opening night because i decided to just fold away the experience of the past five years and open a new page and see what they did with it , " she says .
ahrens returns to her favorite theme of time .
" there are still huge wounds and scars on both sides , i don ’ t think the two germanys have really grown together , but i have a feeling from the reactions to the play , that at least there ’ s a sort of opening up , " she says .

strained relations between the united states and germany have some saying anti-americanism is rising .
but among young germans there 's a difference between opposing the bush administration and being anti-american . before 19-year-old oliver joins his friends between classes at his high school in cologne , he pulls on his levi 's jeans jacket and makes sure his nike tennis shoes are smudge-free .
outside in the courtyard , he lights up a marlboro cigarette and pops open a coke while catching up with his fellow students . american products are simply a part of life for most german young people and the thought of boycotting them seems absurd to oliver , even though he and most of germany 's students disagree profoundly with the iraq policy of the bush administration . " i think you could settle the -lrb- iraq -rrb- situation differently .
and you see that in all the demonstrations all over the world , " he said .
" millions of people are marching in the streets , but it 's as if the americans do n't want to see that . " a survey conducted by the polis institute showed that almost 80 percent of the 14 to 19 year-olds want to participate in demonstrations against a possible war in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.02.2003 drug scandal batters bayer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lipobay 's side effects have become a serious fiscal health issue for bayer .
pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .
the market value of bayer , one of germany 's largest companies , has shrunk by some € 8 billion . on the defensive bayer executives deny that they had any prior knowledge of lipobay 's possible dangers before taking the drug off the market .
attorneys for the company say documents brought forward by plaintiffs have been presented out of context and are misleading . in an attempt to slow the current stock market blood-letting , bayer took out full-page ads in german newspapers on friday .
in them , it defended its actions and said the current stock valuation did not accurately reflect the health of the company and that stockholders had fallen victim to what bayer called " cheap propaganda . " " despite the difficult economic and even global political situation right now , we believe we can put the company back on a path to success , " the ad read . but the litigation in the u.s. clearly has bayer worried , particularly because of the large court settlements that have become common in american courts .
a statement this week by werner wenning , bayer 's chairman , sent stocks tumbling further when he admitted that the company might have to make provisions for liability arising from lipobay .
some estimates put that liability as high at $ 10 billion . andreas theisen of west lb panmure in frankfurt told the financial times that he agreed with bayer that the market reaction to the crisis has not been justified . " however , no one is able to quantify the potential impact , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayer sees no sign of recovery after posting second-quarter results that were well below analysts ’ expectations , the pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant said it saw no reason to expect a turnaround before the end of 2002 .
bayer faces lawsuit munich lawyer michael witti , who successfully sued on behalf of nazi-era slave laborers , will join a lawsuit filed on behalf of those who suffered from side effects of bayer 's cholesterol-reducing drug baycol .

a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .
" i was scared to hear and see it -lrb- the play -rrb- in my mother tongue , i was afraid it would be too close .
i didn ’ t even attend the preview , just the opening night because i decided to just fold away the experience of the past five years and open a new page and see what they did with it , " she says .
ahrens returns to her favorite theme of time .
" there are still huge wounds and scars on both sides , i don ’ t think the two germanys have really grown together , but i have a feeling from the reactions to the play , that at least there ’ s a sort of opening up , " she says .

a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .
" i was scared to hear and see it -lrb- the play -rrb- in my mother tongue , i was afraid it would be too close .
i didn ’ t even attend the preview , just the opening night because i decided to just fold away the experience of the past five years and open a new page and see what they did with it , " she says .

strained relations between the united states and germany have some saying anti-americanism is rising .
but among young germans there 's a difference between opposing the bush administration and being anti-american . before 19-year-old oliver joins his friends between classes at his high school in cologne , he pulls on his levi 's jeans jacket and makes sure his nike tennis shoes are smudge-free .
outside in the courtyard , he lights up a marlboro cigarette and pops open a coke while catching up with his fellow students . american products are simply a part of life for most german young people and the thought of boycotting them seems absurd to oliver , even though he and most of germany 's students disagree profoundly with the iraq policy of the bush administration . " i think you could settle the -lrb- iraq -rrb- situation differently .
and you see that in all the demonstrations all over the world , " he said .
" millions of people are marching in the streets , but it 's as if the americans do n't want to see that . " a survey conducted by the polis institute showed that almost 80 percent of the 14 to 19 year-olds want to participate in demonstrations against a possible war in iraq .
thousands have already hit the streets in protest , including many of the students at oliver 's school , the kreuzgasse gymnasium . " what do i think of the bush administration ?

strained relations between the united states and germany have some saying anti-americanism is rising .
but among young germans there 's a difference between opposing the bush administration and being anti-american . before 19-year-old oliver joins his friends between classes at his high school in cologne , he pulls on his levi 's jeans jacket and makes sure his nike tennis shoes are smudge-free .
outside in the courtyard , he lights up a marlboro cigarette and pops open a coke while catching up with his fellow students . american products are simply a part of life for most german young people and the thought of boycotting them seems absurd to oliver , even though he and most of germany 's students disagree profoundly with the iraq policy of the bush administration . " i think you could settle the -lrb- iraq -rrb- situation differently .
and you see that in all the demonstrations all over the world , " he said .
" millions of people are marching in the streets , but it 's as if the americans do n't want to see that . " a survey conducted by the polis institute showed that almost 80 percent of the 14 to 19 year-olds want to participate in demonstrations against a possible war in iraq .
thousands have already hit the streets in protest , including many of the students at oliver 's school , the kreuzgasse gymnasium . " what do i think of the bush administration ?
not much , " said one young woman .
" i 'd say that america is only acting in its own interests , " said one of her classmates .
most students here responded along those same lines when asked their opinion of u.s. president george w. bush 's iraq policy .
" it looks like he 's going to do what he wants to do , " said one student . policy vs. people but the u.s. president 's poor standing among youth has not translated into anti-americanism , according to rüdiger wersich of the frankfurt center for north american research .
his research has shown that most young people are very critical of bush 's policy and even his manner .
but he adds that attitudes toward u.s. government policy make up only a small part of the mosaic-like picture of america young people have in their minds . " i believe that youth are very capable of differentiating between the current american administration and the sentiment and behavior of the american people , " he said . remarks from the students at the kreuzgasse gymnasium would seem to support wersich 's theory . " i know a lot of people in america who do n't think much of bush either , " one young woman said .
another added , " you have to look at the bigger picture .
you ca n't lay the blame on all americans . " one student said she always tried to think about what it would be like if the tables were turned .

victims of the nazi regime in austria may now have grounds for further compensation . it 's long overdue , say critics .
earlier this week , the austrian historical commission , established for the documentation of the extent of austrian complicity in nazi crimes , delivered its final report .
the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .
they didn ’ t switch to an active policy of economic restitution until 1955 , and only then under strong pressure from the allies . restitution has been held up by the austrians ’ difficulty in coming to terms with their past .
after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .
as part of the so-called arianization law , everything belonging to jews – shops , cars , land , musical instruments – was expropriated .
in vienna alone , 60,000 apartments were confiscated .
the euthanasia program ordered the deaths of thousands of handicapped people , and their belongings were often claimed by the doctors who oversaw their death .
“ they were robbed - their valuables became a resource for the doctors - this is a particularly grisly tale ” jabloner said . of the 200,000 jews living in vienna before 1938 , only 1,000 survived .
what became of their belongings has hardly been addressed , and only now - with the publication of this report - can austria and victims begin the careful work of determining a fair deal . according to jabloner , the new findings may help victims to successfully seek further compensation .
but he also has strong words of warning for those hoping to close this chapter in history - vigilance is needed , he says . " we all know the prejudices that persist ; how widespread the belief is that the jews didn ’ t have to pay any taxes after 1945 , that there were only rich jews in austria prior to 1938 , ” jabloner said .

the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .
they didn ’ t switch to an active policy of economic restitution until 1955 , and only then under strong pressure from the allies . restitution has been held up by the austrians ’ difficulty in coming to terms with their past .
after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .
as part of the so-called arianization law , everything belonging to jews – shops , cars , land , musical instruments – was expropriated .
in vienna alone , 60,000 apartments were confiscated .
the euthanasia program ordered the deaths of thousands of handicapped people , and their belongings were often claimed by the doctors who oversaw their death .
“ they were robbed - their valuables became a resource for the doctors - this is a particularly grisly tale ” jabloner said . of the 200,000 jews living in vienna before 1938 , only 1,000 survived .
what became of their belongings has hardly been addressed , and only now - with the publication of this report - can austria and victims begin the careful work of determining a fair deal . according to jabloner , the new findings may help victims to successfully seek further compensation .
but he also has strong words of warning for those hoping to close this chapter in history - vigilance is needed , he says . " we all know the prejudices that persist ; how widespread the belief is that the jews didn ’ t have to pay any taxes after 1945 , that there were only rich jews in austria prior to 1938 , ” jabloner said .
“ even today , many are still influenced by the national socialists ’ propaganda . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan .

the tower , which would be among the world 's tallest structures , is surrounded by a series of interconnecting public pathways and spaces , including a square perfectly positioned to fill with light between 8:46 a.m. when the first plane hit and 10:28 a.m. when the second tower fell , every sept .

seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .

" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .

libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan .

seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse .

victims of the nazi regime in austria may now have grounds for further compensation . it 's long overdue , say critics .
earlier this week , the austrian historical commission , established for the documentation of the extent of austrian complicity in nazi crimes , delivered its final report .
the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .
they didn ’ t switch to an active policy of economic restitution until 1955 , and only then under strong pressure from the allies . restitution has been held up by the austrians ’ difficulty in coming to terms with their past .
after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .
as part of the so-called arianization law , everything belonging to jews – shops , cars , land , musical instruments – was expropriated .
in vienna alone , 60,000 apartments were confiscated .
the euthanasia program ordered the deaths of thousands of handicapped people , and their belongings were often claimed by the doctors who oversaw their death .
“ they were robbed - their valuables became a resource for the doctors - this is a particularly grisly tale ” jabloner said . of the 200,000 jews living in vienna before 1938 , only 1,000 survived .
what became of their belongings has hardly been addressed , and only now - with the publication of this report - can austria and victims begin the careful work of determining a fair deal . according to jabloner , the new findings may help victims to successfully seek further compensation .
but he also has strong words of warning for those hoping to close this chapter in history - vigilance is needed , he says . " we all know the prejudices that persist ; how widespread the belief is that the jews didn ’ t have to pay any taxes after 1945 , that there were only rich jews in austria prior to 1938 , ” jabloner said .

victims of the nazi regime in austria may now have grounds for further compensation . it 's long overdue , say critics .
earlier this week , the austrian historical commission , established for the documentation of the extent of austrian complicity in nazi crimes , delivered its final report .
the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .

pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .
the market value of bayer , one of germany 's largest companies , has shrunk by some € 8 billion . on the defensive bayer executives deny that they had any prior knowledge of lipobay 's possible dangers before taking the drug off the market .
attorneys for the company say documents brought forward by plaintiffs have been presented out of context and are misleading . in an attempt to slow the current stock market blood-letting , bayer took out full-page ads in german newspapers on friday .
in them , it defended its actions and said the current stock valuation did not accurately reflect the health of the company and that stockholders had fallen victim to what bayer called " cheap propaganda . " " despite the difficult economic and even global political situation right now , we believe we can put the company back on a path to success , " the ad read . but the litigation in the u.s. clearly has bayer worried , particularly because of the large court settlements that have become common in american courts .
a statement this week by werner wenning , bayer 's chairman , sent stocks tumbling further when he admitted that the company might have to make provisions for liability arising from lipobay .
some estimates put that liability as high at $ 10 billion . andreas theisen of west lb panmure in frankfurt told the financial times that he agreed with bayer that the market reaction to the crisis has not been justified .

the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2003 play sheds light on dark east german secret großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the perfect world of marion -lrb- played by actress anna-maria kuricová -rrb- comes crashing down when she learns the terrible truth of her adoption .
a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .

a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . after months of debate , new york officials chose the structure by berlin-based architect daniel libeskind wednesday night and made the official announcement on thursday .
libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan . " with the selection of the team of studio daniel libeskind we have accomplished all three objectives and in doing so we take a significant step toward fulfilling our vision , " he said at a news conference announcing the decision . libeskind 's design , titled " memory foundations " features a tower 1,776-foot -lrb- 541 meters -rrb- high that ends in a multi-story garden .
the tower , which would be among the world 's tallest structures , is surrounded by a series of interconnecting public pathways and spaces , including a square perfectly positioned to fill with light between 8:46 a.m. when the first plane hit and 10:28 a.m. when the second tower fell , every sept .
11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this one of the proposed designs for the rebuilding of new york 's world trade center , by studio daniel libeskind , presented in new york wednesday dec .
18 , 2002 .
seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .
the plot of land is owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey , but new york developer larry silverstein owns the lease to build offices and commercial stores on the site . " he 's got a right to rebuild and an obligation to rebuild , " louis tomson , president of the lower manhattan development corporation , which ran the selection process said of silverstein .
" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .
new york city officials said that the design will undergo some refinement as various civic groups and relatives of victims of the attacks jostle for a say in what fills the empty space .
building is only expected to begin in 2005 , at the earliest . libeskind 's big break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american architect daniel libeskind smiles during a tour for journalists inside the new jewish museum in berlin friday , january 22 , 1999 .
the museum designed as a destroyed star of david will be opened this weekend .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- the selection is nevertheless a huge coup for libeskind .
the architect -lrb- photo -rrb- has won acclaim for his addition to the jewish museum in berlin and his imperial war museum in manchester , great britain . the 57-year-old architect was born in postwar poland and travelled to the united states with the intention of studying music .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture . " i arrived by ship to new york as a teenager , an immigrant , and like millions of others before me , my first sight was the statue of liberty and the amazing skyline of manhattan , " he wrote in the opening of a description of his design .
" i have never forgotten that sight or what it stands for .
this is what this project is all about . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interview : wtc design finalist daniel libeskind dw-world interviews the architect about his design .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . after months of debate , new york officials chose the structure by berlin-based architect daniel libeskind wednesday night and made the official announcement on thursday .
libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan . " with the selection of the team of studio daniel libeskind we have accomplished all three objectives and in doing so we take a significant step toward fulfilling our vision , " he said at a news conference announcing the decision . libeskind 's design , titled " memory foundations " features a tower 1,776-foot -lrb- 541 meters -rrb- high that ends in a multi-story garden .
the tower , which would be among the world 's tallest structures , is surrounded by a series of interconnecting public pathways and spaces , including a square perfectly positioned to fill with light between 8:46 a.m. when the first plane hit and 10:28 a.m. when the second tower fell , every sept .
11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this one of the proposed designs for the rebuilding of new york 's world trade center , by studio daniel libeskind , presented in new york wednesday dec .
18 , 2002 .
seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .
the plot of land is owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey , but new york developer larry silverstein owns the lease to build offices and commercial stores on the site . " he 's got a right to rebuild and an obligation to rebuild , " louis tomson , president of the lower manhattan development corporation , which ran the selection process said of silverstein .
" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .
new york city officials said that the design will undergo some refinement as various civic groups and relatives of victims of the attacks jostle for a say in what fills the empty space .
building is only expected to begin in 2005 , at the earliest . libeskind 's big break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american architect daniel libeskind smiles during a tour for journalists inside the new jewish museum in berlin friday , january 22 , 1999 .
the museum designed as a destroyed star of david will be opened this weekend .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- the selection is nevertheless a huge coup for libeskind .
the architect -lrb- photo -rrb- has won acclaim for his addition to the jewish museum in berlin and his imperial war museum in manchester , great britain . the 57-year-old architect was born in postwar poland and travelled to the united states with the intention of studying music .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture . " i arrived by ship to new york as a teenager , an immigrant , and like millions of others before me , my first sight was the statue of liberty and the amazing skyline of manhattan , " he wrote in the opening of a description of his design .
" i have never forgotten that sight or what it stands for .
this is what this project is all about . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interview : wtc design finalist daniel libeskind dw-world interviews the architect about his design .

pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .
the market value of bayer , one of germany 's largest companies , has shrunk by some € 8 billion . on the defensive bayer executives deny that they had any prior knowledge of lipobay 's possible dangers before taking the drug off the market .
attorneys for the company say documents brought forward by plaintiffs have been presented out of context and are misleading . in an attempt to slow the current stock market blood-letting , bayer took out full-page ads in german newspapers on friday .
in them , it defended its actions and said the current stock valuation did not accurately reflect the health of the company and that stockholders had fallen victim to what bayer called " cheap propaganda . " " despite the difficult economic and even global political situation right now , we believe we can put the company back on a path to success , " the ad read . but the litigation in the u.s. clearly has bayer worried , particularly because of the large court settlements that have become common in american courts .
a statement this week by werner wenning , bayer 's chairman , sent stocks tumbling further when he admitted that the company might have to make provisions for liability arising from lipobay .
some estimates put that liability as high at $ 10 billion . andreas theisen of west lb panmure in frankfurt told the financial times that he agreed with bayer that the market reaction to the crisis has not been justified .

victims of the nazi regime in austria may now have grounds for further compensation . it 's long overdue , say critics .
earlier this week , the austrian historical commission , established for the documentation of the extent of austrian complicity in nazi crimes , delivered its final report .
the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .

after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .
as part of the so-called arianization law , everything belonging to jews – shops , cars , land , musical instruments – was expropriated .

the euthanasia program ordered the deaths of thousands of handicapped people , and their belongings were often claimed by the doctors who oversaw their death .
“ they were robbed - their valuables became a resource for the doctors - this is a particularly grisly tale ” jabloner said . of the 200,000 jews living in vienna before 1938 , only 1,000 survived .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2003 play sheds light on dark east german secret großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the perfect world of marion -lrb- played by actress anna-maria kuricová -rrb- comes crashing down when she learns the terrible truth of her adoption .
a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "

a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .

victims of the nazi regime in austria may now have grounds for further compensation . it 's long overdue , say critics .
earlier this week , the austrian historical commission , established for the documentation of the extent of austrian complicity in nazi crimes , delivered its final report .
the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .
they didn ’ t switch to an active policy of economic restitution until 1955 , and only then under strong pressure from the allies . restitution has been held up by the austrians ’ difficulty in coming to terms with their past .
after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .
as part of the so-called arianization law , everything belonging to jews – shops , cars , land , musical instruments – was expropriated .
in vienna alone , 60,000 apartments were confiscated .
the euthanasia program ordered the deaths of thousands of handicapped people , and their belongings were often claimed by the doctors who oversaw their death .
“ they were robbed - their valuables became a resource for the doctors - this is a particularly grisly tale ” jabloner said . of the 200,000 jews living in vienna before 1938 , only 1,000 survived .
what became of their belongings has hardly been addressed , and only now - with the publication of this report - can austria and victims begin the careful work of determining a fair deal . according to jabloner , the new findings may help victims to successfully seek further compensation .
but he also has strong words of warning for those hoping to close this chapter in history - vigilance is needed , he says . " we all know the prejudices that persist ; how widespread the belief is that the jews didn ’ t have to pay any taxes after 1945 , that there were only rich jews in austria prior to 1938 , ” jabloner said .
“ even today , many are still influenced by the national socialists ’ propaganda . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .
they didn ’ t switch to an active policy of economic restitution until 1955 , and only then under strong pressure from the allies . restitution has been held up by the austrians ’ difficulty in coming to terms with their past .
after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .
as part of the so-called arianization law , everything belonging to jews – shops , cars , land , musical instruments – was expropriated .
in vienna alone , 60,000 apartments were confiscated .
the euthanasia program ordered the deaths of thousands of handicapped people , and their belongings were often claimed by the doctors who oversaw their death .
“ they were robbed - their valuables became a resource for the doctors - this is a particularly grisly tale ” jabloner said . of the 200,000 jews living in vienna before 1938 , only 1,000 survived .
what became of their belongings has hardly been addressed , and only now - with the publication of this report - can austria and victims begin the careful work of determining a fair deal . according to jabloner , the new findings may help victims to successfully seek further compensation .
but he also has strong words of warning for those hoping to close this chapter in history - vigilance is needed , he says . " we all know the prejudices that persist ; how widespread the belief is that the jews didn ’ t have to pay any taxes after 1945 , that there were only rich jews in austria prior to 1938 , ” jabloner said .
“ even today , many are still influenced by the national socialists ’ propaganda . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .
the market value of bayer , one of germany 's largest companies , has shrunk by some € 8 billion . on the defensive bayer executives deny that they had any prior knowledge of lipobay 's possible dangers before taking the drug off the market .
attorneys for the company say documents brought forward by plaintiffs have been presented out of context and are misleading . in an attempt to slow the current stock market blood-letting , bayer took out full-page ads in german newspapers on friday .
in them , it defended its actions and said the current stock valuation did not accurately reflect the health of the company and that stockholders had fallen victim to what bayer called " cheap propaganda . " " despite the difficult economic and even global political situation right now , we believe we can put the company back on a path to success , " the ad read . but the litigation in the u.s. clearly has bayer worried , particularly because of the large court settlements that have become common in american courts .
a statement this week by werner wenning , bayer 's chairman , sent stocks tumbling further when he admitted that the company might have to make provisions for liability arising from lipobay .
some estimates put that liability as high at $ 10 billion . andreas theisen of west lb panmure in frankfurt told the financial times that he agreed with bayer that the market reaction to the crisis has not been justified .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . after months of debate , new york officials chose the structure by berlin-based architect daniel libeskind wednesday night and made the official announcement on thursday .
libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan . " with the selection of the team of studio daniel libeskind we have accomplished all three objectives and in doing so we take a significant step toward fulfilling our vision , " he said at a news conference announcing the decision . libeskind 's design , titled " memory foundations " features a tower 1,776-foot -lrb- 541 meters -rrb- high that ends in a multi-story garden .
the tower , which would be among the world 's tallest structures , is surrounded by a series of interconnecting public pathways and spaces , including a square perfectly positioned to fill with light between 8:46 a.m. when the first plane hit and 10:28 a.m. when the second tower fell , every sept .
11 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this one of the proposed designs for the rebuilding of new york 's world trade center , by studio daniel libeskind , presented in new york wednesday dec .
18 , 2002 .
seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .
the plot of land is owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey , but new york developer larry silverstein owns the lease to build offices and commercial stores on the site . " he 's got a right to rebuild and an obligation to rebuild , " louis tomson , president of the lower manhattan development corporation , which ran the selection process said of silverstein .
" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .
new york city officials said that the design will undergo some refinement as various civic groups and relatives of victims of the attacks jostle for a say in what fills the empty space .
building is only expected to begin in 2005 , at the earliest . libeskind 's big break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american architect daniel libeskind smiles during a tour for journalists inside the new jewish museum in berlin friday , january 22 , 1999 .
the museum designed as a destroyed star of david will be opened this weekend .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- the selection is nevertheless a huge coup for libeskind .
the architect -lrb- photo -rrb- has won acclaim for his addition to the jewish museum in berlin and his imperial war museum in manchester , great britain . the 57-year-old architect was born in postwar poland and travelled to the united states with the intention of studying music .
it was only in the early 1970s that he began to study architecture . " i arrived by ship to new york as a teenager , an immigrant , and like millions of others before me , my first sight was the statue of liberty and the amazing skyline of manhattan , " he wrote in the opening of a description of his design .
" i have never forgotten that sight or what it stands for .

pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .

strained relations between the united states and germany have some saying anti-americanism is rising .
but among young germans there 's a difference between opposing the bush administration and being anti-american . before 19-year-old oliver joins his friends between classes at his high school in cologne , he pulls on his levi 's jeans jacket and makes sure his nike tennis shoes are smudge-free .
outside in the courtyard , he lights up a marlboro cigarette and pops open a coke while catching up with his fellow students . american products are simply a part of life for most german young people and the thought of boycotting them seems absurd to oliver , even though he and most of germany 's students disagree profoundly with the iraq policy of the bush administration . " i think you could settle the -lrb- iraq -rrb- situation differently .
and you see that in all the demonstrations all over the world , " he said .
" millions of people are marching in the streets , but it 's as if the americans do n't want to see that . " a survey conducted by the polis institute showed that almost 80 percent of the 14 to 19 year-olds want to participate in demonstrations against a possible war in iraq .
thousands have already hit the streets in protest , including many of the students at oliver 's school , the kreuzgasse gymnasium . " what do i think of the bush administration ?
not much , " said one young woman .
" i 'd say that america is only acting in its own interests , " said one of her classmates .
most students here responded along those same lines when asked their opinion of u.s. president george w. bush 's iraq policy .
" it looks like he 's going to do what he wants to do , " said one student . policy vs. people but the u.s. president 's poor standing among youth has not translated into anti-americanism , according to rüdiger wersich of the frankfurt center for north american research .
his research has shown that most young people are very critical of bush 's policy and even his manner .
but he adds that attitudes toward u.s. government policy make up only a small part of the mosaic-like picture of america young people have in their minds . " i believe that youth are very capable of differentiating between the current american administration and the sentiment and behavior of the american people , " he said . remarks from the students at the kreuzgasse gymnasium would seem to support wersich 's theory . " i know a lot of people in america who do n't think much of bush either , " one young woman said .
another added , " you have to look at the bigger picture .
you ca n't lay the blame on all americans . " one student said she always tried to think about what it would be like if the tables were turned .
" i do n't identify completely with the schröder administration , but i 'm still german , " she said .
" but i think it would be wrong if someone said : ' you german .
your chancellor is doing something wrong and you 're just like him . " ' kurt gamerschlag , head of the council on international educational exchange , an organization that sets up school year abroad programs in the u.s. for german students , said he is not surprised at the lack of anti-american sentiment even in the face of a possible u.s.-led war on iraq . he said students in germany are more interested in hearing from their friends or family members in the u.s. and about their personal experiences there than about current foreign policy developments in washington .

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . after months of debate , new york officials chose the structure by berlin-based architect daniel libeskind wednesday night and made the official announcement on thursday .
libeskind 's design for the 16- acre-site edged out the other finalists , a new york-based team led by architects rafael vinoly and frederic schwartz . mayor michael bloomberg , a key member of the agency established to oversee redevelopment and a memorial , said the design should " poignantly recall for all time what happened on 9/11 , to remake it as a center of global culture and commerce and to integrate it into a revitalized lower manhattan . " with the selection of the team of studio daniel libeskind we have accomplished all three objectives and in doing so we take a significant step toward fulfilling our vision , " he said at a news conference announcing the decision . libeskind 's design , titled " memory foundations " features a tower 1,776-foot -lrb- 541 meters -rrb- high that ends in a multi-story garden .
the tower , which would be among the world 's tallest structures , is surrounded by a series of interconnecting public pathways and spaces , including a square perfectly positioned to fill with light between 8:46 a.m. when the first plane hit and 10:28 a.m. when the second tower fell , every sept .

seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .
the plot of land is owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey , but new york developer larry silverstein owns the lease to build offices and commercial stores on the site . " he 's got a right to rebuild and an obligation to rebuild , " louis tomson , president of the lower manhattan development corporation , which ran the selection process said of silverstein .
" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .
new york city officials said that the design will undergo some refinement as various civic groups and relatives of victims of the attacks jostle for a say in what fills the empty space .
building is only expected to begin in 2005 , at the earliest . libeskind 's big break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american architect daniel libeskind smiles during a tour for journalists inside the new jewish museum in berlin friday , january 22 , 1999 .

" with the selection of the team of studio daniel libeskind we have accomplished all three objectives and in doing so we take a significant step toward fulfilling our vision , " he said at a news conference announcing the decision . libeskind 's design , titled " memory foundations " features a tower 1,776-foot -lrb- 541 meters -rrb- high that ends in a multi-story garden .
the tower , which would be among the world 's tallest structures , is surrounded by a series of interconnecting public pathways and spaces , including a square perfectly positioned to fill with light between 8:46 a.m. when the first plane hit and 10:28 a.m. when the second tower fell , every sept .

18 , 2002 .
seven teams of architects from around the world presented their designs , beginning an intensive six weeks of review before a final plan is chosen to develop the 16-acre site and the surrounding neighborhood . the $ 330 million design also takes visitors 70 feet below street level to the foundations that survived the impact of the hijacked airliners and towers ' collapse . " the walls are not just the footprint of the towers , which is something very abstract .
it 's a kind of sacred and spiritual area , " libeskind said in an interview with dw-world two weeks ago .
" they are really the witnesses to the power of democracy - they withstood the attack .
these indelible footprints really capture the dignity and profundity of the event . " much debate still to come how exactly the final product will match up to the polish émigré architect 's blueprint is unclear .
what should follow the world trade center towers has been a hotly debated topic for more than a year .
the plot of land is owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey , but new york developer larry silverstein owns the lease to build offices and commercial stores on the site . " he 's got a right to rebuild and an obligation to rebuild , " louis tomson , president of the lower manhattan development corporation , which ran the selection process said of silverstein .
" the port -lrb- authority -rrb- , which is his landlord , has the right to demand he rebuild and the obligation not to be unreasonable - that 's about all the rules there are . "
silverstein , who would n't comment thursday , has said that he did n't like either the libeskind or vinoly designs .
new york city officials said that the design will undergo some refinement as various civic groups and relatives of victims of the attacks jostle for a say in what fills the empty space .
building is only expected to begin in 2005 , at the earliest . libeskind 's big break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american architect daniel libeskind smiles during a tour for journalists inside the new jewish museum in berlin friday , january 22 , 1999 .

-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- the selection is nevertheless a huge coup for libeskind .

a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .
" i was scared to hear and see it -lrb- the play -rrb- in my mother tongue , i was afraid it would be too close .
i didn ’ t even attend the preview , just the opening night because i decided to just fold away the experience of the past five years and open a new page and see what they did with it , " she says .
ahrens returns to her favorite theme of time .
" there are still huge wounds and scars on both sides , i don ’ t think the two germanys have really grown together , but i have a feeling from the reactions to the play , that at least there ’ s a sort of opening up , " she says .

strained relations between the united states and germany have some saying anti-americanism is rising .
but among young germans there 's a difference between opposing the bush administration and being anti-american . before 19-year-old oliver joins his friends between classes at his high school in cologne , he pulls on his levi 's jeans jacket and makes sure his nike tennis shoes are smudge-free .
outside in the courtyard , he lights up a marlboro cigarette and pops open a coke while catching up with his fellow students . american products are simply a part of life for most german young people and the thought of boycotting them seems absurd to oliver , even though he and most of germany 's students disagree profoundly with the iraq policy of the bush administration . " i think you could settle the -lrb- iraq -rrb- situation differently .
and you see that in all the demonstrations all over the world , " he said .
" millions of people are marching in the streets , but it 's as if the americans do n't want to see that . " a survey conducted by the polis institute showed that almost 80 percent of the 14 to 19 year-olds want to participate in demonstrations against a possible war in iraq .
thousands have already hit the streets in protest , including many of the students at oliver 's school , the kreuzgasse gymnasium . " what do i think of the bush administration ?
not much , " said one young woman .
" i 'd say that america is only acting in its own interests , " said one of her classmates .
most students here responded along those same lines when asked their opinion of u.s. president george w. bush 's iraq policy .
" it looks like he 's going to do what he wants to do , " said one student . policy vs. people but the u.s. president 's poor standing among youth has not translated into anti-americanism , according to rüdiger wersich of the frankfurt center for north american research .
his research has shown that most young people are very critical of bush 's policy and even his manner .
but he adds that attitudes toward u.s. government policy make up only a small part of the mosaic-like picture of america young people have in their minds . " i believe that youth are very capable of differentiating between the current american administration and the sentiment and behavior of the american people , " he said . remarks from the students at the kreuzgasse gymnasium would seem to support wersich 's theory . " i know a lot of people in america who do n't think much of bush either , " one young woman said .
another added , " you have to look at the bigger picture .
you ca n't lay the blame on all americans . " one student said she always tried to think about what it would be like if the tables were turned .
" i do n't identify completely with the schröder administration , but i 'm still german , " she said .
" but i think it would be wrong if someone said : ' you german .
your chancellor is doing something wrong and you 're just like him . " ' kurt gamerschlag , head of the council on international educational exchange , an organization that sets up school year abroad programs in the u.s. for german students , said he is not surprised at the lack of anti-american sentiment even in the face of a possible u.s.-led war on iraq . he said students in germany are more interested in hearing from their friends or family members in the u.s. and about their personal experiences there than about current foreign policy developments in washington .

" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .
" i was scared to hear and see it -lrb- the play -rrb- in my mother tongue , i was afraid it would be too close .
i didn ’ t even attend the preview , just the opening night because i decided to just fold away the experience of the past five years and open a new page and see what they did with it , " she says .
ahrens returns to her favorite theme of time .
" there are still huge wounds and scars on both sides , i don ’ t think the two germanys have really grown together , but i have a feeling from the reactions to the play , that at least there ’ s a sort of opening up , " she says .

victims of the nazi regime in austria may now have grounds for further compensation . it 's long overdue , say critics .
earlier this week , the austrian historical commission , established for the documentation of the extent of austrian complicity in nazi crimes , delivered its final report .
the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .
they didn ’ t switch to an active policy of economic restitution until 1955 , and only then under strong pressure from the allies . restitution has been held up by the austrians ’ difficulty in coming to terms with their past .
after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .
as part of the so-called arianization law , everything belonging to jews – shops , cars , land , musical instruments – was expropriated .

“ they were robbed - their valuables became a resource for the doctors - this is a particularly grisly tale ” jabloner said . of the 200,000 jews living in vienna before 1938 , only 1,000 survived .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.02.2003 play sheds light on dark east german secret großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the perfect world of marion -lrb- played by actress anna-maria kuricová -rrb- comes crashing down when she learns the terrible truth of her adoption .
a decade after it was rejected as too controversial and staged in ireland instead , a play on forced adoptions in east germany has made its debut in germany .
playwright renate ahrens shares her odyssey with dw-world . timing has played a key role in renate ahrens ’ career as a playwright ever since she penned her first play in 1993 .
at the time she approached several theaters in germany with the manuscript , but remembers that the reaction from all of them was similar - " nobody wants to see anything like that now , come back in 10 or 15 years , " she was told .
" it must have been too early then , just three or four years after the fall of the wall , " the author told dw-world in an interview from her hamburg home .
ahrens ' script dealt with a dark , little-known chapter of history in east germany . in the 1970s the communist government forcefully wrested away young children from parents they thought might try to flee to the free west and gave them up for adoption to conformist east german couples .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens now a decade after those initial hesitations and rejections , the time seems to be right as ahrens ’ -lrb- photo -rrb- play , mütter-los , translated loosely as " motherless " - once deemed too controversial for the german public - opened to packed audiences at a nuremberg theater last weekend .
the play deals with the classic east-west conflict through the confused and anguished lens of 18-year-old marion .
the girl , who lives in a small eastern german town , is suddenly confronted by her real mother from the west after the fall of the berlin wall and the terrible truth of her adoption .
ironically , ahrens found it easier to stage the play in ireland than in germany .
timing of play coincides with ireland 's startling discovery " i didn ’ t want to wait 10 or 15 years , i decided to go ahead with it , " the 48-year-old says as she explains how she took the manuscript with her to dublin - where she has also lived since 1986 - after it was rejected in germany and was translated into english as part of a writers ’ group .
in 1997 , ahrens was approached by an irish director who showed interest in staging the play .
" the time was right there , " ahrens says when asked how an irish audience would react to a play with such a strong german theme .
in 1997 , adoption files were discovered in a musty archive in dublin that shed light on a wave of adoptions in ireland in the 1950s and 1960s .
at that time , women in the strictly catholic republic of ireland who gave birth outside of wedlock often had to give up their children to catholic institutions , which in turn gave the children to childless catholic couples in the united states .
" often the mothers were as young as 17 or 18 , had to promise that they would never try to find their children , and their children were given other names , so there was no way to find them , " says ahrens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magdalen sisters " these children were by then in their forties or fifties and the discovery of the files suddenly caused a wave of american citizens coming to ireland to see their real mothers .
it caused quite a stir in irish society , " she said .
the acclaimed recent film " the magdalena sisters " -lrb- photo -rrb- documents that difficult chapter in irish history .
it was against that background that the irish theater group storytellers began performing ahrens ’ play in english in 1998 under the title when the wall came down .
they toured successfully through ireland and northern ireland .
though the theme of the play was quintessentially german , the irish - with their sudden discovery of a long-kept secret - were able to relate to the play better .
" it ’ s easier if you see something of yourself in something foreign , " ahrens says .
play passes litmus test in berlin in july 1999 , ahrens faced her first real test with the german public , when the irish group performed the play at a small english-speaking theater in berlin 's kreuzberg district .
" we were warned that the audience might find this quite patronizing - an irish company performing in english a play that ’ s so german in germany , " ahrens says .
but instead the performances opened to packed audiences and the local media went overboard with reviews and portraits of it .
" people from both the east and the west were there .
it was fascinating .
there were actually people who said they knew families whom it had happened to , " says ahrens .
but the overwhelming reaction from the majority of people , especially from the east was " we never knew , " she says .
interest sparked by newspaper article ahrens first stumbled upon the topic of forced adoptions in east germany through a chance reading of a newspaper article in 1990 .
the issue had been quashed for years by the communist east german government .
ahrens recalls that one of the offices of the newsmagazine der spiegel in east berlin was shut down in 1975 by the communist government after a correspondent reported on the forced adoptions .
" there was a huge outcry at the time , but after that the story disappeared totally and for the next 15 years i didn ’ t hear anything , " she says .
but in the time that has lapsed since , ahrens has spent considerable time pondering difficult junctures in germany 's past . " i ’ m really interested in the history of the two germanys .
i was born and grew up in west germany and every time i went to east berlin , it was so incredibly foreign to me though we spoke the same language !
discovering that article jarred something in me and i decided to do something about it , " she says .
ahrens then dug around in newspaper archives and libraries , and what she came up with , she says , was " amazing . "
" i initially thought there were perhaps 10 or 15 politically motivated cases of forced adoptions , but there were more and more running into the hundreds , " she says .
the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 also opened the gates to classified files of the east german secret police -lrb- stasi -rrb- that threw much light on the true extent of the forced adoptions .
intense and poignant ahrens ’ play takes place in 1990 , when the berlin wall has just been torn down , but the formal reunification of the two germanys has not yet taken place .
roswitha berger , who has lived with her husband in west germany near hamburg for several years , makes her way to the crumbling east , her old home .
in the early 1970s , her attempt to escape to the west with her husband and baby failed and she landed in prison , where her child was forcefully taken away from her .
berger and her husband were eventually deported to the west , but had no idea what had happened to their child .
with the opening of the wall , berger comes across a stasi file which reveals that her child is now called marion and lives in a small eastern german town .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate ahrens mütter-los berger arrives in the town and meets with the unsuspecting 18-year-old marion , who lives a content life with her adoptive east german parents , but harbors great dreams of being a musician and going to the west .
marion ’ s world begins collapsing as she learns the terrible truth of her adoption and begins to question her identity .
the scene is set for an intensely emotional and poignant family and personal drama .
" time 's now right for a discussion " " i didn ’ t have a certain political aim when i wrote the play , i was interested in their characters and stories .
i feel all of us in germany have to live with this past , with two germanys - i see marion as a sort of incarnation of that , " ahrens says .
ahrens admits that she was terrified when the play finally opened in german for the first time in nuremberg last week .
" i was scared to hear and see it -lrb- the play -rrb- in my mother tongue , i was afraid it would be too close .
i didn ’ t even attend the preview , just the opening night because i decided to just fold away the experience of the past five years and open a new page and see what they did with it , " she says .
ahrens returns to her favorite theme of time .
" there are still huge wounds and scars on both sides , i don ’ t think the two germanys have really grown together , but i have a feeling from the reactions to the play , that at least there ’ s a sort of opening up , " she says .

pharmaceutical giant bayer is being pounded by the courts and stockholders as the crisis over its lipobay drug deepens .
the cholesterol-lowering drug was pulled from shelves in 2001 after it was linked to 52 deaths . when bayer 's lipobay drug went on the market in the mid-1990s , it was an instant success .
until 2001 , some 7 million patients took the cholesterol-lowering tablets , earning bayer millions in profits .
now that same drug is threatening to ruin the financial health of the leverkusen-based conglomerate . a case now in a u.s. court could cost bayer several hundred million dollars in damages if plaintiffs can prove that bayer executives knew of the possible dangers of the drug without removing it from pharmacy shelves . the company first pulled lipobay - sold in the united states under the baycor brand - from the market in 2001 after it was linked to serious side effects including 52 deaths .
some patients who took the drug in combination with certain other medications developed severe muscle weakness , and some 100 deaths worldwide are suspected to be linked to the bayer product . did the bosses know ? lawyers in a texas case involving a retired engineer who developed a muscle disorder after taking the drug have submitted memos and e-mails that they claim show that members of bayer 's management knew of the drug 's side effects well before the company pulled it off the market in 2001 .
a new york times article also raised suspicions that executives knew that high doses of the drug could cause health problems .
mikal watts , the attorney representing the plaintiff in the texas case , has said he will ask for $ 500 million in punitive damages . that case is only one of some 8,000 complaints against bayer that have been submitted in the united states . lawyers are now considering bringing a class-action lawsuit against the company .
bayer has already spent more than $ 125 million to settle 450 cases related to the drug .
the company is currently seeking to reach settlements in 500 more cases . the latest developments have sent bayer stock into freefall .
shares have dropped by more than 20 percent this week alone .
from highs of € 50 -lrb- $ 53.94 -rrb- a share before the lipobay recall , bayer stocks had fallen to € 12.10 by friday .
the market value of bayer , one of germany 's largest companies , has shrunk by some € 8 billion . on the defensive bayer executives deny that they had any prior knowledge of lipobay 's possible dangers before taking the drug off the market .
attorneys for the company say documents brought forward by plaintiffs have been presented out of context and are misleading . in an attempt to slow the current stock market blood-letting , bayer took out full-page ads in german newspapers on friday .
in them , it defended its actions and said the current stock valuation did not accurately reflect the health of the company and that stockholders had fallen victim to what bayer called " cheap propaganda . " " despite the difficult economic and even global political situation right now , we believe we can put the company back on a path to success , " the ad read . but the litigation in the u.s. clearly has bayer worried , particularly because of the large court settlements that have become common in american courts .
a statement this week by werner wenning , bayer 's chairman , sent stocks tumbling further when he admitted that the company might have to make provisions for liability arising from lipobay .
some estimates put that liability as high at $ 10 billion . andreas theisen of west lb panmure in frankfurt told the financial times that he agreed with bayer that the market reaction to the crisis has not been justified . " however , no one is able to quantify the potential impact , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayer sees no sign of recovery after posting second-quarter results that were well below analysts ’ expectations , the pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant said it saw no reason to expect a turnaround before the end of 2002 .
bayer faces lawsuit munich lawyer michael witti , who successfully sued on behalf of nazi-era slave laborers , will join a lawsuit filed on behalf of those who suffered from side effects of bayer 's cholesterol-reducing drug baycol .

victims of the nazi regime in austria may now have grounds for further compensation . it 's long overdue , say critics .
earlier this week , the austrian historical commission , established for the documentation of the extent of austrian complicity in nazi crimes , delivered its final report .
the commission is already making waves with its conclusions - with the body 's own president raising the possibility that victims may now have a stronger case for seeking further compensation , no doubt armed by new findings . commission president clemens jabloner described the government 's restitution efforts as half-hearted , and his report does not mince words . it characterizes restitution efforts as being “ without oversight , without responsibility and complicated by numerous laws and ordinances that reflect the complicated interests of the political parties , business groups , victims ' organizations and the allies . ” what took so long ? dredging up the past proved no easy task in a country that has long maintained that it was also a victim of nazi aggression .
a massive undertaking , it took more than 160 researchers to complete the report . the austrian historical commission was formed in 1998 – 50 years after the nazi army marched into austria .
however , it was only under strong pressure from the jewish community that it was established , a step that reminded critics of a similar development many years before : after world war ii , the austrian government pursued a policy of “ natural restitution , ” returning only what physically remained and could be tracked down , such as apartments that were confiscated under nazi rule .
they didn ’ t switch to an active policy of economic restitution until 1955 , and only then under strong pressure from the allies . restitution has been held up by the austrians ’ difficulty in coming to terms with their past .
after the end of world war ii , many austrians cultivated a national myth , which still persists : they were also victims of nazi aggression . and though the austrian government has offered close to $ 800 million in restitution payments to settle claims relating to forced labor , expropriation of businesses and theft of art and other cultural properties , restitution efforts have often found little political support .
the country 's most recent initiative was a $ 215 million settlement between austria , austrian companies and jewish groups representing holocaust survivors and victims ' families in 2001 . “ restitution and compensation were – from the start - never viewed as a national duty , due to the comfortable argument provided by the lawful and politically calculating victim theory , ” jabloner said . the painful truth the report , released on monday , solidifies what had long been suspected - that many austrians participated in nazi crimes .
as part of the so-called arianization law , everything belonging to jews – shops , cars , land , musical instruments – was expropriated .
in vienna alone , 60,000 apartments were confiscated .
the euthanasia program ordered the deaths of thousands of handicapped people , and their belongings were often claimed by the doctors who oversaw their death .
“ they were robbed - their valuables became a resource for the doctors - this is a particularly grisly tale ” jabloner said . of the 200,000 jews living in vienna before 1938 , only 1,000 survived .
what became of their belongings has hardly been addressed , and only now - with the publication of this report - can austria and victims begin the careful work of determining a fair deal . according to jabloner , the new findings may help victims to successfully seek further compensation .
but he also has strong words of warning for those hoping to close this chapter in history - vigilance is needed , he says . " we all know the prejudices that persist ; how widespread the belief is that the jews didn ’ t have to pay any taxes after 1945 , that there were only rich jews in austria prior to 1938 , ” jabloner said .
“ even today , many are still influenced by the national socialists ’ propaganda . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour picture of the day dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw-world : dw screensaver dw-world : social bookmarking dw-world : our rss feeds dw-world : dw widgets dw-world : integrated search externer link , ã  â ¶ ffnet in neuem fenster : dw on facebook externer link , ã  â ¶ ffnet in neuem fenster : newsletters externer link , ã  â ¶ ffnet in neuem fenster : netvibes.com the way you want it dw-world : mobile optimized for pdas externer link , ã  â ¶ ffnet in neuem fenster : newsletters news in your inbox externer link , ã  â ¶ ffnet in neuem fenster : audio / video podcasts © dw 2009 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

militant groups from the naga tribes are opposed to indian administration and demand recognition as an independent people .
now a tentative ceasefire is in place but even the militants signed up to peace talks with delhi are busy preparing for renewed violence .
the crisis has gripped the state for more than half a century .

" area domination " is a polite term for military control .
the men on patrol were some of the tens of thousands of indian security forces in nagaland .
no-one knows exactly how many people have died in the conflict , but some estimate that between 100,000 and 200,000 have been killed .
indian officer akhilesh sharma told me his job was to protect local villagers .
" we are just considering it as confidence building measures for the locals .
in case of any problem they can count on us and we 'll always be there to help them . "
delicate peace to find the militants , we had to walk deep into the jungle , led by fighters from the national socialist council of nagaland i-m .

the bbc were the first tv team they had ever brought to see their training camp .
inside a large encampment , cleared of jungle , and cut into dirt terraces , we found more than 400 new recruits .
the recruits were cautious about talking to us - but akato , a 23 year old , told me his father , grandfather and uncle had died fighting india .
he said it was his duty to take up the cause and held that he was not asking for anything that did not belong to him .
" i am asking for something that belongs to me and my nation .
i believe nagas are not asking for anything extra , " said akato .

he added that such thoughts defined his political existence as a nation .
