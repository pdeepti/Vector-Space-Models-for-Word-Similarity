one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .
john doyle has been working to make germans laugh for eight years .
his efforts have paid off and he 's achieved national recognition . john doyle has been through more than a few trying times in his eight-year relationship with stand-up comedy .
he remembers his first solo show in cologne , where he had to perform for 90 minutes .
he got exactly two laughs . " and even then the audience was n't laughing at my jokes , but at my one-year-old son who 'd decided to take a stroll across the stage , " he told deutsche welle . then there was the time at a rock music festival when he followed a music act .
one minute into his routine and the beer bottles and curses started flying .
five minutes later , he literally ran for his life from the stage . " i almost needed therapy after that , " he said . how times change .
last month , doyle stood on stage at star search , a televised talent show of sorts , and performed to an audience of 3.1 million .
they loved him .
he moved steadily ahead in the competition , leaving his native-born competitors in the dust .
during the final , some 5.5 million tuned in . those flying beer bottles are but a distant memory , since today its contracts and acclaim that are hurtling his way .
while he did n't win the star search final , he did mightily impress germany 's comedy community . " that 's the best that i 've seen in a long time , " said hugo egon balder , one of germany 's leading comedy promoters and a star search jury members . now doyle has now been asked to be one of the headliners for blue monday , a show on german television which features up-and-coming talent .
two days later there 's a comedy festival and back to back gigs .
all of the sudden , the once struggling american comedian who almost begged for bookings at rotary club meetings is having to turn down offers . masochistic tendencies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john doyle doyle admits doing comedy in germany , in german , is not the easiest job in the world , and not what he thought he would be doing when he came to germany twelve years ago for a language course .
he stayed , married a german and had a child .
still , some aspects of life here were hard to get used to . " germany is more serious than america in some ways , especially in daily life , " he said .
" i needed some levity , so i started to make jokes about life here , basically using comedy as a way of dealing with my reality . " as his command of the language improved , he decided to go public with his jokes , which often deal with being caught somewhere in the middle of germany and america .
he says he feels like something of an outsider to both cultures , a condition that might lead to low-level psychic trauma at times , but puts him in an ideal place to make droll observations about the absurdities in both societies . " i mean , if i see someone standing at a deserted street corner at 2:00 a.m. waiting for the light to change before he crosses the street , i 'm going to grab that , because an american would n't do that , " he said .
" a german probably would n't pick up on the humor in that picture . " not that different while the cliché of the humourless german might still be alive and kicking , doyle says it 's not that much harder to get germans to laugh than it is to get americans to bust a gut .
both audiences are demanding , he said , and want clever material that they can relate to in some way .
the trick , he said , is simple in theory and extremely difficult in practice : figuring out what they find funny . there are some differences though .
while topics around sex are often good for a laugh , german audiences wo n't go as far as their american counterparts .
doyle says there are still taboos in germany that have mostly faded in the u.s. and if a comedian ventures too far , accusations of being crude and hitting below the belt are quick to fly . on the other hand , since germans can have a more relaxed attitude towards sex over all than the average american , jokes that a u.s. audience would find risqué and therefore funny can fall flat in germany . " the response is sometimes like - so what ? "
doyle said . the funny american being known primarily as " that funny american guy " has been both good and bad for doyle 's comedy career .
his foreignness has given him more license to try out material that germans might not get away with .
he says because he 's not german , he is n't under the same constraints . " you 're not breaking rules , because the rules do n't apply to you , " he said .
" people just laugh and think , look at john , that weird american . " at the same time , there are downsides .
he lacks some of the common frames of reference that his german colleagues share with their audiences .
and since he is so strongly identified as an american , he is limited to stand-up gigs .
sketch comedy , popular on german television right now , is not an option for him .
he could n't just play a taxi driver or the henpecked husband because the audience would n't accept it . but he can live with that .
stand-up is his love and he 's hoping it 's going to take him to his own show one of these days .
right now he 's basking in the attention his star search success has brought him and relishing the hard-won recognition . " i always felt that there was something big inside me and it was disappointing since no one seemed to know it except for me and my wife , " doyle laughed .
" it 's exciting to know that i was n't completely deluding myself all those years .

according to a report in the british broadsheet the guardian , officials from the uk will tell their eu colleagues that any planning for european military operations must be carried out strictly under the auspices of the atlantic alliance . there have already been calls from paris , echoed by some voices within brussels , for the european union to co-ordinate and mount its own military operations through a " european military force .

according to a report in the british broadsheet the guardian , officials from the uk will tell their eu colleagues that any planning for european military operations must be carried out strictly under the auspices of the atlantic alliance . there have already been calls from paris , echoed by some voices within brussels , for the european union to co-ordinate and mount its own military operations through a " european military force . "
belgium and luxembourg are also in favor of the force and join germany and france in the so-called " gang of four " - the name given to the eu countries that opposed the u.s.-led invasion of iraq by pro-nato critics of the plan . eu force could anger the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato .
on the surface , britain agrees that the eu should be able to plan its own operations , but only from nato ’ s headquarters near mons in belgium .
however , british officials are warning their eu counterparts that the franco-german initiative will antagonize the united states and create unnecessary duplication between the eu and nato . many detractors see the idea of forming an eu force as an empty gesture after the divisions of the iraq crisis and some , britain in particular , are angry that it is still being pursued . ironically , the idea of eu defense was pioneered by britain and france after the end of the kosovo war in 1999 , a conflict which showed in glaring detail the huge gap between europe and the united states in terms of military might . current peacekeeping duties would increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , the eu has succeeded in creating new institutions and procedures and has deployed troops in peacekeeping missions in macedonia and congo .
plans to create a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force are also under way .
but anything larger will meet stiff resistance from british prime minister tony blair ’ s government . defense is one of the most controversial items in the eu 's draft constitution , which is due to be finalized in negotiations between all 15 member states starting in october .
if blair continues to oppose the formation of the force , he can count on the support of other nato loyalists such as the netherlands , poland , spain and denmark as well as neutral or non-aligned states .
with considerable disagreement about how to mould a common eu defense policy , the timing is far from optimal for planning such a force . compromise could make things worse any compromise is unlikely to break the deadlock completely .
sources quoted in the guardian report suggest that the french may agree on the british proposal for a " dedicated eu planning cell " without the military force to back it up but will give up any of their own ambitions to form an army to carry out the cell ’ s operations . the result could be an even worse situation where an eu “ trojan horse ” operates within nato while the eu expands and duplicates its own military structures outside it , some critics have warned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rapid reaction force ready by year 's end the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.08.2003 freed sahara hostage : " life will return to normal " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking forward to everyday life : released sahara hostage reto walther kidnappers held reto walther and 13 other tourists hostage for over five months in the sahara desert until late august .
in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , walther recalled his ordeal . reto walther was one of 13 tourists freed by their captors in mali after nearly six months on august 19 .
since the group - including nine germans , four swiss and one dutch national - returned home , politicians in germany have discussed the possibility of requiring the hostages to help foot the bill for the efforts to release them . a total of 32 european vacationers were seized in separate incidents in february and march this year in southern algeria , where they were traveling .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may by killing their kidnappers , who belonged to the salafist group for preaching and combat islamist extremist group .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 . in an interview with deutsche welle , 31-year-old walther discussed his experience as a hostage . mr. walther , how are you faring after the long period in captivity ? i 'm quite surprised myself .
i 'm actually doing well .
i 'm healthy .
i 'm also happy to be home .
i 've still got an adrenaline high .
i 'm happy to be together with my wife and that keeps me full of energy . do you plan to seek professional help after this ordeal ?
you were part of the group that had to bury michaela spitzer in the middle of the night after she died of heatstroke , and you yourself held the eulogy .
how are you dealing with the trauma ? i actually feel relatively strong , perhaps too strong for some people .
but i 've also been persuaded to get professional help .
i 'm looking for the right place .
in any case , i will want to address this problem with professional help . mr. walther , on march 19 the kidnappers gave you a radio and you were able to follow the progress of efforts for your release .
did this umbilical cord - if you 'll permit the expression - help or did it intensify the feeling of powerlessness ?
you heard about search parties that may have been nearby , but you could n't contact them . that 's right .
of course , it was a very , very difficult situation for the whole group .
i can remember one evening where we heard that people were asking whether we had just got lost in the desert or whether we were the victims of a crime .
and i also remember that the mood was very , very low that evening .
then later , when the radio - deutsche welle - reported that search parties were en route , that people were looking for us from the air , the mood naturally improved and expectations increased as well . we were all very happy about the radio .
that 's how we heard about the war in iraq and then also about the other group that had been kidnapped that was later freed .
we heard that too .
we were happy for them , but we were disappointed that the other group was freed and not us . we only considered two radio broadcasters reliable , not just us hostages but also our kidnappers .
those were deutsche welle and i think a moroccan or french broadcaster that aired in french .
but we were always happy that we could receive deutsche welle at all because it broadcast really objective , good news .
hats off , really . did the kidnappers tell you why they took away the radio after three months ? they did n't give a reason .
the order came from the group 's highest leader .
i think it was due to reasons of security . there has been much speculation about the kidnappers motives .
they were split into two groups - the radicals and then there were those who slipped you food sometimes , who also apologized to you for the kidnapping .
to what extent did you see the kidnapping as being political - or was the main objective ransom money ? that 's a difficult question that i ca n't really answer .
my feeling says it is a politically motivated group that presumably just wanted money to buy something to be more mobile again with the help of this crime .
i think ultimately we were n't a political motive .
but that 's an assumption and not really well-founded . what will you do next ?
will you start to work again soon ?
will you travel to the sahara again ? i wo n't travel to the sahara for two reasons .
for one , it 's too unsafe there for me and secondly , my wife in pregnant .
i did n't know that for a long time during the kidnapping .
we are expecting our first child in november , and i will have an entirely new role as a father , which i 'm very happy about .
life will return to normal .
i will be able to work again next week , i hope .

in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , walther recalled his ordeal . reto walther was one of 13 tourists freed by their captors in mali after nearly six months on august 19 .
since the group - including nine germans , four swiss and one dutch national - returned home , politicians in germany have discussed the possibility of requiring the hostages to help foot the bill for the efforts to release them . a total of 32 european vacationers were seized in separate incidents in february and march this year in southern algeria , where they were traveling .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may by killing their kidnappers , who belonged to the salafist group for preaching and combat islamist extremist group .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 . in an interview with deutsche welle , 31-year-old walther discussed his experience as a hostage . mr. walther , how are you faring after the long period in captivity ? i 'm quite surprised myself .
i 'm actually doing well .
i 'm healthy .
i 'm also happy to be home .
i 've still got an adrenaline high .
i 'm happy to be together with my wife and that keeps me full of energy . do you plan to seek professional help after this ordeal ?
you were part of the group that had to bury michaela spitzer in the middle of the night after she died of heatstroke , and you yourself held the eulogy .
how are you dealing with the trauma ? i actually feel relatively strong , perhaps too strong for some people .
but i 've also been persuaded to get professional help .
i 'm looking for the right place .
in any case , i will want to address this problem with professional help . mr. walther , on march 19 the kidnappers gave you a radio and you were able to follow the progress of efforts for your release .
did this umbilical cord - if you 'll permit the expression - help or did it intensify the feeling of powerlessness ?
you heard about search parties that may have been nearby , but you could n't contact them . that 's right .
of course , it was a very , very difficult situation for the whole group .
i can remember one evening where we heard that people were asking whether we had just got lost in the desert or whether we were the victims of a crime .
and i also remember that the mood was very , very low that evening .
then later , when the radio - deutsche welle - reported that search parties were en route , that people were looking for us from the air , the mood naturally improved and expectations increased as well . we were all very happy about the radio .
that 's how we heard about the war in iraq and then also about the other group that had been kidnapped that was later freed .
we heard that too .
we were happy for them , but we were disappointed that the other group was freed and not us . we only considered two radio broadcasters reliable , not just us hostages but also our kidnappers .
those were deutsche welle and i think a moroccan or french broadcaster that aired in french .
but we were always happy that we could receive deutsche welle at all because it broadcast really objective , good news .
hats off , really . did the kidnappers tell you why they took away the radio after three months ? they did n't give a reason .
the order came from the group 's highest leader .
i think it was due to reasons of security . there has been much speculation about the kidnappers motives .
they were split into two groups - the radicals and then there were those who slipped you food sometimes , who also apologized to you for the kidnapping .
to what extent did you see the kidnapping as being political - or was the main objective ransom money ? that 's a difficult question that i ca n't really answer .
my feeling says it is a politically motivated group that presumably just wanted money to buy something to be more mobile again with the help of this crime .
i think ultimately we were n't a political motive .
but that 's an assumption and not really well-founded . what will you do next ?
will you start to work again soon ?
will you travel to the sahara again ? i wo n't travel to the sahara for two reasons .
for one , it 's too unsafe there for me and secondly , my wife in pregnant .
i did n't know that for a long time during the kidnapping .
we are expecting our first child in november , and i will have an entirely new role as a father , which i 'm very happy about .

german chancellor gerhard schröder says he ’ s going to run for third term in 2006 with foreign minister joschka fischer as his co-pilot .
the decision ends speculation fischer may be headed for brussels . in a surprise move thursday , a german chancellor gerhard schröder confirmed he and foreign minister joschka fischer plan to run for a third term in the 2006 national election .
the announcement comes amid a steep drop in popularity ratings for schröder 's social democrats as the attempt to implement painful economic and social reforms .
in taking the decision , the green party 's fischer has abandoned any intention of becoming a candidate for the future office of european union foreign minister in brussels - at least for now .
in an interview televised thursday night , schröder sought to assuage critics who complained he had taken too long to make up his mind .
" i could have announced my decision at an earlier stage , " he said , " but then you have to consider that such a move gravely affects one ’ s personal life and my family , and it had to be carefully coordinated with my party first .
this is why i didn ’ t rush things . "
difficult reforms the social democrats have suffered a free-fall in popularity since the general election last september due to at least in part their inability to effectively articulate their economic and social reform drive to the public . the party now trails the conservative opposition by as much as 14 percentage points in public opinion polls .
the government ’ s planned cuts in the country ’ s welfare system have alienated many of the party 's core voters .
by announcing his decision to stand again , the chancellor obviously wanted to send out a signal that he does not intend to pass on the buck to someone else when it comes to implementing his difficult reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz in a hastily convened press conference , spd general secretary olaf scholz welcomed the move .
" there ’ s wide-spread agreement in our party that we want to win the 2006 election again , " he said .
" with gerhard schröder at the helm , it worked well twice in the past , and it will work again in 2006 with him – and only with him . "
schröder first took office in 1998 in a coalition with the environmentalist greens .
voters reelected the same coalition last september by the narrowest margin in germany ’ s post-war history .
in the past few years , schröder repeatedly insisted he would only serve until 2006 , saying that eight years in office would be a sufficient amount of time .
but in recent weeks , the chancellor had been less outspoken when asked about the possibility of running for a third term , largely due to the lack of a viable successor within his party .
there has been considerable speculation in recent months that schröder might send fischer to brussels to take either the post of eu foreign minister if the constitution calling for the position is passed by eu member countries .
barring that development , fischer would also have been a serious candidate for a post on the european commission in brussels , which will be replace its existing commissioners in 2004 .
opposition to circle wagons unsettled by schröder ’ s plan to run again , opposition politicians are already battening down the hatches for a tough campaign .
guido westerwelle , who leads the neo-liberal free democratic party , called schröder ’ s plan to seek reelection a " menace to society " and pledged to thwart schröder ’ s candidacy .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also took shots at schröder .
" germany is grappling with enormous problems in reforming the economy and its social system , " said the party ’ s general secretary , laurenz meyer .
" and the chancellor has nothing to do but publicly moot his own political future .
what a disgrace !
you can not help but conclude that he ’ s out to deceive the public and distract from the country ’ s current economic woes . "

in taking the decision , the green party 's fischer has abandoned any intention of becoming a candidate for the future office of european union foreign minister in brussels - at least for now .
in an interview televised thursday night , schröder sought to assuage critics who complained he had taken too long to make up his mind .
" i could have announced my decision at an earlier stage , " he said , " but then you have to consider that such a move gravely affects one ’ s personal life and my family , and it had to be carefully coordinated with my party first .
this is why i didn ’ t rush things . "
difficult reforms the social democrats have suffered a free-fall in popularity since the general election last september due to at least in part their inability to effectively articulate their economic and social reform drive to the public . the party now trails the conservative opposition by as much as 14 percentage points in public opinion polls .
the government ’ s planned cuts in the country ’ s welfare system have alienated many of the party 's core voters .
by announcing his decision to stand again , the chancellor obviously wanted to send out a signal that he does not intend to pass on the buck to someone else when it comes to implementing his difficult reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz in a hastily convened press conference , spd general secretary olaf scholz welcomed the move .
" there ’ s wide-spread agreement in our party that we want to win the 2006 election again , " he said .
" with gerhard schröder at the helm , it worked well twice in the past , and it will work again in 2006 with him – and only with him . "
schröder first took office in 1998 in a coalition with the environmentalist greens .
voters reelected the same coalition last september by the narrowest margin in germany ’ s post-war history .
in the past few years , schröder repeatedly insisted he would only serve until 2006 , saying that eight years in office would be a sufficient amount of time .
but in recent weeks , the chancellor had been less outspoken when asked about the possibility of running for a third term , largely due to the lack of a viable successor within his party .
there has been considerable speculation in recent months that schröder might send fischer to brussels to take either the post of eu foreign minister if the constitution calling for the position is passed by eu member countries .
barring that development , fischer would also have been a serious candidate for a post on the european commission in brussels , which will be replace its existing commissioners in 2004 .
opposition to circle wagons unsettled by schröder ’ s plan to run again , opposition politicians are already battening down the hatches for a tough campaign .
guido westerwelle , who leads the neo-liberal free democratic party , called schröder ’ s plan to seek reelection a " menace to society " and pledged to thwart schröder ’ s candidacy .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also took shots at schröder .
" germany is grappling with enormous problems in reforming the economy and its social system , " said the party ’ s general secretary , laurenz meyer .
" and the chancellor has nothing to do but publicly moot his own political future .
what a disgrace !
you can not help but conclude that he ’ s out to deceive the public and distract from the country ’ s current economic woes . "
despite his current political woes there is still good news for the chancellor : the social democrats maybe be wallowing in public opinion polls , but a recent survey by the forsa institute found that 51 percent of germans would still support a third schröder candidacy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read dw-world 's complete archive of 2002 election coverage - with profiles of politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system .

the german finance ministry admitted on friday deficit spending in berlin will exceed euro stability pact limits for a second year in a row .
if eu budgetary limits are breeched next year , brussels may impose sanctions . although the news was long expected , finance minister hans eichel officially confirmed friday that german public deficit spending would exceed the limit set forth in the maastricht treaty for the second year in a row .
but with an estimated budget deficit hitting 3.8 percent of gross domestic product for 2003 , berlin delivered a figure higher than previously expected . only as recently as july , the ministry was still forecasting maximum deficit spending of 3.5 percent – the same amount germany booked last year .
but as germany ’ s economy has stalled this year , the government has been required to borrow more . german finance minister hans eichel attributed the deficit prognosis to the " still restrained national economic developments that have created additional burdens for the labor market . "
the deficit has also been compounded by a decrease in tax revenues , which the government said were lower in summer than spring . in the run-up to the announcement , german chancellor gerhard schröder began a campaign in the media seeking to persuade brussels to interpret the maastricht rules more loosely .
though germany is home to the largest economy within the eu , it is also currently the weakest .
and schröder is seeking to find more wiggle room to help spark growth . " we don ’ t want to leave the stability pact , but we want to interpret it in an economically sensible way , " schröder told a group of foreign correspondents in berlin this week , according to the financial times newspaper .
the chancellor added that he believed his view is " shared by the french government and i haven ’ t seen italy taking a different position . " breaking the 3-percent limit under the maastricht treaty , eu members with the euro can not have budget deficits larger than 3 percent of gross domestic product in order to maintain the stability of the common currency .
if a euro zone country violates the treaty three years in a row , the european commission can impose sanctions ranging from taking greater control over national budget-making decisions to levying fines that can run as high as 0.5 percent of a country ’ s gross domestic product . during a trip to brussels earlier this week , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin said his country would continue to support the stability pact , but he called on the european commission to be more " flexible " about its interpretation .
earlier this week , the parisian financial newspaper les echos reported that the french finance ministry feared a deficit that could run as high as 3.9 percent this year . " europe will do its job , and the french government will do its job , " raffarin said at a joint press conference with european commission president romano prodi on wednesday .
" my primary responsibly is to do everything to increase growth and improve employment . " fair treatment but smaller eu countries are angered by attempts in berlin and paris to water-down the stability pact – led by countries like austria and the netherlands , which have worked hard to balance their budgets . schröder , meanwhile , called for " fair treatment " from the commission .
in the past , schröder and his foreign minister , joschka fischer , have both hinted that berlin has an understanding with brussels that penalties will not be imposed next year if the limits are breached , the financial times reported . and at the moment the commission is remaining optimistic it won ’ t have to .
on friday , a spokesman for the eu ’ s monetary affairs commissioner , pedro solbes , told reporters that as long as germany continued with its strict budgeting plans and economic and social system reforms that there was a " good possibility " the country ’ s deficit spending would fall below three percent again in 2004 and that economic growth that year could reach 2 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu warns of deficit action against france , germany if germany exceeds the 3 percent public spending deficit cap imposed by the pact ensuring the stability of the euro for a third consecutive year in 2004 , brussels may be forced to impose stiff fines or other punitive measures .

one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .
john doyle has been working to make germans laugh for eight years .
his efforts have paid off and he 's achieved national recognition . john doyle has been through more than a few trying times in his eight-year relationship with stand-up comedy .
he remembers his first solo show in cologne , where he had to perform for 90 minutes .
he got exactly two laughs . " and even then the audience was n't laughing at my jokes , but at my one-year-old son who 'd decided to take a stroll across the stage , " he told deutsche welle . then there was the time at a rock music festival when he followed a music act .
one minute into his routine and the beer bottles and curses started flying .
five minutes later , he literally ran for his life from the stage . " i almost needed therapy after that , " he said . how times change .
last month , doyle stood on stage at star search , a televised talent show of sorts , and performed to an audience of 3.1 million .
they loved him .
he moved steadily ahead in the competition , leaving his native-born competitors in the dust .
during the final , some 5.5 million tuned in . those flying beer bottles are but a distant memory , since today its contracts and acclaim that are hurtling his way .
while he did n't win the star search final , he did mightily impress germany 's comedy community . " that 's the best that i 've seen in a long time , " said hugo egon balder , one of germany 's leading comedy promoters and a star search jury members . now doyle has now been asked to be one of the headliners for blue monday , a show on german television which features up-and-coming talent .
two days later there 's a comedy festival and back to back gigs .
all of the sudden , the once struggling american comedian who almost begged for bookings at rotary club meetings is having to turn down offers . masochistic tendencies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john doyle doyle admits doing comedy in germany , in german , is not the easiest job in the world , and not what he thought he would be doing when he came to germany twelve years ago for a language course .
he stayed , married a german and had a child .
still , some aspects of life here were hard to get used to . " germany is more serious than america in some ways , especially in daily life , " he said .
" i needed some levity , so i started to make jokes about life here , basically using comedy as a way of dealing with my reality . " as his command of the language improved , he decided to go public with his jokes , which often deal with being caught somewhere in the middle of germany and america .
he says he feels like something of an outsider to both cultures , a condition that might lead to low-level psychic trauma at times , but puts him in an ideal place to make droll observations about the absurdities in both societies . " i mean , if i see someone standing at a deserted street corner at 2:00 a.m. waiting for the light to change before he crosses the street , i 'm going to grab that , because an american would n't do that , " he said .
" a german probably would n't pick up on the humor in that picture . " not that different while the cliché of the humourless german might still be alive and kicking , doyle says it 's not that much harder to get germans to laugh than it is to get americans to bust a gut .
both audiences are demanding , he said , and want clever material that they can relate to in some way .
the trick , he said , is simple in theory and extremely difficult in practice : figuring out what they find funny . there are some differences though .
while topics around sex are often good for a laugh , german audiences wo n't go as far as their american counterparts .
doyle says there are still taboos in germany that have mostly faded in the u.s. and if a comedian ventures too far , accusations of being crude and hitting below the belt are quick to fly . on the other hand , since germans can have a more relaxed attitude towards sex over all than the average american , jokes that a u.s. audience would find risqué and therefore funny can fall flat in germany . " the response is sometimes like - so what ? "
doyle said . the funny american being known primarily as " that funny american guy " has been both good and bad for doyle 's comedy career .
his foreignness has given him more license to try out material that germans might not get away with .
he says because he 's not german , he is n't under the same constraints . " you 're not breaking rules , because the rules do n't apply to you , " he said .
" people just laugh and think , look at john , that weird american . " at the same time , there are downsides .
he lacks some of the common frames of reference that his german colleagues share with their audiences .
and since he is so strongly identified as an american , he is limited to stand-up gigs .
sketch comedy , popular on german television right now , is not an option for him .
he could n't just play a taxi driver or the henpecked husband because the audience would n't accept it . but he can live with that .
stand-up is his love and he 's hoping it 's going to take him to his own show one of these days .
right now he 's basking in the attention his star search success has brought him and relishing the hard-won recognition . " i always felt that there was something big inside me and it was disappointing since no one seemed to know it except for me and my wife , " doyle laughed .
" it 's exciting to know that i was n't completely deluding myself all those years .

german chancellor gerhard schröder says he ’ s going to run for third term in 2006 with foreign minister joschka fischer as his co-pilot .
the decision ends speculation fischer may be headed for brussels . in a surprise move thursday , a german chancellor gerhard schröder confirmed he and foreign minister joschka fischer plan to run for a third term in the 2006 national election .
the announcement comes amid a steep drop in popularity ratings for schröder 's social democrats as the attempt to implement painful economic and social reforms .
in taking the decision , the green party 's fischer has abandoned any intention of becoming a candidate for the future office of european union foreign minister in brussels - at least for now .
in an interview televised thursday night , schröder sought to assuage critics who complained he had taken too long to make up his mind .
" i could have announced my decision at an earlier stage , " he said , " but then you have to consider that such a move gravely affects one ’ s personal life and my family , and it had to be carefully coordinated with my party first .
this is why i didn ’ t rush things . "
difficult reforms the social democrats have suffered a free-fall in popularity since the general election last september due to at least in part their inability to effectively articulate their economic and social reform drive to the public . the party now trails the conservative opposition by as much as 14 percentage points in public opinion polls .
the government ’ s planned cuts in the country ’ s welfare system have alienated many of the party 's core voters .
by announcing his decision to stand again , the chancellor obviously wanted to send out a signal that he does not intend to pass on the buck to someone else when it comes to implementing his difficult reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz in a hastily convened press conference , spd general secretary olaf scholz welcomed the move .
" there ’ s wide-spread agreement in our party that we want to win the 2006 election again , " he said .
" with gerhard schröder at the helm , it worked well twice in the past , and it will work again in 2006 with him – and only with him . "
schröder first took office in 1998 in a coalition with the environmentalist greens .
voters reelected the same coalition last september by the narrowest margin in germany ’ s post-war history .
in the past few years , schröder repeatedly insisted he would only serve until 2006 , saying that eight years in office would be a sufficient amount of time .
but in recent weeks , the chancellor had been less outspoken when asked about the possibility of running for a third term , largely due to the lack of a viable successor within his party .
there has been considerable speculation in recent months that schröder might send fischer to brussels to take either the post of eu foreign minister if the constitution calling for the position is passed by eu member countries .
barring that development , fischer would also have been a serious candidate for a post on the european commission in brussels , which will be replace its existing commissioners in 2004 .
opposition to circle wagons unsettled by schröder ’ s plan to run again , opposition politicians are already battening down the hatches for a tough campaign .
guido westerwelle , who leads the neo-liberal free democratic party , called schröder ’ s plan to seek reelection a " menace to society " and pledged to thwart schröder ’ s candidacy .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also took shots at schröder .
" germany is grappling with enormous problems in reforming the economy and its social system , " said the party ’ s general secretary , laurenz meyer .
" and the chancellor has nothing to do but publicly moot his own political future .
what a disgrace !
you can not help but conclude that he ’ s out to deceive the public and distract from the country ’ s current economic woes . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.08.2003 bridging the transatlantic comedy divide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john doyle , funny guy .
one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .
john doyle has been working to make germans laugh for eight years .
his efforts have paid off and he 's achieved national recognition . john doyle has been through more than a few trying times in his eight-year relationship with stand-up comedy .
he remembers his first solo show in cologne , where he had to perform for 90 minutes .
he got exactly two laughs . " and even then the audience was n't laughing at my jokes , but at my one-year-old son who 'd decided to take a stroll across the stage , " he told deutsche welle . then there was the time at a rock music festival when he followed a music act .
one minute into his routine and the beer bottles and curses started flying .
five minutes later , he literally ran for his life from the stage . " i almost needed therapy after that , " he said . how times change .
last month , doyle stood on stage at star search , a televised talent show of sorts , and performed to an audience of 3.1 million .
they loved him .
he moved steadily ahead in the competition , leaving his native-born competitors in the dust .
during the final , some 5.5 million tuned in . those flying beer bottles are but a distant memory , since today its contracts and acclaim that are hurtling his way .
while he did n't win the star search final , he did mightily impress germany 's comedy community . " that 's the best that i 've seen in a long time , " said hugo egon balder , one of germany 's leading comedy promoters and a star search jury members . now doyle has now been asked to be one of the headliners for blue monday , a show on german television which features up-and-coming talent .
two days later there 's a comedy festival and back to back gigs .
all of the sudden , the once struggling american comedian who almost begged for bookings at rotary club meetings is having to turn down offers . masochistic tendencies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john doyle doyle admits doing comedy in germany , in german , is not the easiest job in the world , and not what he thought he would be doing when he came to germany twelve years ago for a language course .
he stayed , married a german and had a child .
still , some aspects of life here were hard to get used to . " germany is more serious than america in some ways , especially in daily life , " he said .
" i needed some levity , so i started to make jokes about life here , basically using comedy as a way of dealing with my reality . " as his command of the language improved , he decided to go public with his jokes , which often deal with being caught somewhere in the middle of germany and america .
he says he feels like something of an outsider to both cultures , a condition that might lead to low-level psychic trauma at times , but puts him in an ideal place to make droll observations about the absurdities in both societies . " i mean , if i see someone standing at a deserted street corner at 2:00 a.m. waiting for the light to change before he crosses the street , i 'm going to grab that , because an american would n't do that , " he said .
" a german probably would n't pick up on the humor in that picture . " not that different while the cliché of the humourless german might still be alive and kicking , doyle says it 's not that much harder to get germans to laugh than it is to get americans to bust a gut .
both audiences are demanding , he said , and want clever material that they can relate to in some way .
the trick , he said , is simple in theory and extremely difficult in practice : figuring out what they find funny . there are some differences though .
while topics around sex are often good for a laugh , german audiences wo n't go as far as their american counterparts .
doyle says there are still taboos in germany that have mostly faded in the u.s. and if a comedian ventures too far , accusations of being crude and hitting below the belt are quick to fly . on the other hand , since germans can have a more relaxed attitude towards sex over all than the average american , jokes that a u.s. audience would find risqué and therefore funny can fall flat in germany . " the response is sometimes like - so what ? "
doyle said . the funny american being known primarily as " that funny american guy " has been both good and bad for doyle 's comedy career .
his foreignness has given him more license to try out material that germans might not get away with .
he says because he 's not german , he is n't under the same constraints . " you 're not breaking rules , because the rules do n't apply to you , " he said .
" people just laugh and think , look at john , that weird american . " at the same time , there are downsides .
he lacks some of the common frames of reference that his german colleagues share with their audiences .
and since he is so strongly identified as an american , he is limited to stand-up gigs .
sketch comedy , popular on german television right now , is not an option for him .
he could n't just play a taxi driver or the henpecked husband because the audience would n't accept it . but he can live with that .
stand-up is his love and he 's hoping it 's going to take him to his own show one of these days .
right now he 's basking in the attention his star search success has brought him and relishing the hard-won recognition . " i always felt that there was something big inside me and it was disappointing since no one seemed to know it except for me and my wife , " doyle laughed .
" it 's exciting to know that i was n't completely deluding myself all those years .

one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .
john doyle has been working to make germans laugh for eight years .
his efforts have paid off and he 's achieved national recognition . john doyle has been through more than a few trying times in his eight-year relationship with stand-up comedy .
he remembers his first solo show in cologne , where he had to perform for 90 minutes .
he got exactly two laughs . " and even then the audience was n't laughing at my jokes , but at my one-year-old son who 'd decided to take a stroll across the stage , " he told deutsche welle . then there was the time at a rock music festival when he followed a music act .
one minute into his routine and the beer bottles and curses started flying .
five minutes later , he literally ran for his life from the stage . " i almost needed therapy after that , " he said . how times change .
last month , doyle stood on stage at star search , a televised talent show of sorts , and performed to an audience of 3.1 million .
they loved him .
he moved steadily ahead in the competition , leaving his native-born competitors in the dust .
during the final , some 5.5 million tuned in . those flying beer bottles are but a distant memory , since today its contracts and acclaim that are hurtling his way .
while he did n't win the star search final , he did mightily impress germany 's comedy community . " that 's the best that i 've seen in a long time , " said hugo egon balder , one of germany 's leading comedy promoters and a star search jury members . now doyle has now been asked to be one of the headliners for blue monday , a show on german television which features up-and-coming talent .
two days later there 's a comedy festival and back to back gigs .
all of the sudden , the once struggling american comedian who almost begged for bookings at rotary club meetings is having to turn down offers . masochistic tendencies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john doyle doyle admits doing comedy in germany , in german , is not the easiest job in the world , and not what he thought he would be doing when he came to germany twelve years ago for a language course .
he stayed , married a german and had a child .
still , some aspects of life here were hard to get used to . " germany is more serious than america in some ways , especially in daily life , " he said .
" i needed some levity , so i started to make jokes about life here , basically using comedy as a way of dealing with my reality . " as his command of the language improved , he decided to go public with his jokes , which often deal with being caught somewhere in the middle of germany and america .
he says he feels like something of an outsider to both cultures , a condition that might lead to low-level psychic trauma at times , but puts him in an ideal place to make droll observations about the absurdities in both societies . " i mean , if i see someone standing at a deserted street corner at 2:00 a.m. waiting for the light to change before he crosses the street , i 'm going to grab that , because an american would n't do that , " he said .
" a german probably would n't pick up on the humor in that picture . " not that different while the cliché of the humourless german might still be alive and kicking , doyle says it 's not that much harder to get germans to laugh than it is to get americans to bust a gut .
both audiences are demanding , he said , and want clever material that they can relate to in some way .
the trick , he said , is simple in theory and extremely difficult in practice : figuring out what they find funny . there are some differences though .
while topics around sex are often good for a laugh , german audiences wo n't go as far as their american counterparts .
doyle says there are still taboos in germany that have mostly faded in the u.s. and if a comedian ventures too far , accusations of being crude and hitting below the belt are quick to fly . on the other hand , since germans can have a more relaxed attitude towards sex over all than the average american , jokes that a u.s. audience would find risqué and therefore funny can fall flat in germany . " the response is sometimes like - so what ? "
doyle said . the funny american being known primarily as " that funny american guy " has been both good and bad for doyle 's comedy career .
his foreignness has given him more license to try out material that germans might not get away with .
he says because he 's not german , he is n't under the same constraints . " you 're not breaking rules , because the rules do n't apply to you , " he said .
" people just laugh and think , look at john , that weird american . " at the same time , there are downsides .
he lacks some of the common frames of reference that his german colleagues share with their audiences .
and since he is so strongly identified as an american , he is limited to stand-up gigs .
sketch comedy , popular on german television right now , is not an option for him .
he could n't just play a taxi driver or the henpecked husband because the audience would n't accept it . but he can live with that .
stand-up is his love and he 's hoping it 's going to take him to his own show one of these days .
right now he 's basking in the attention his star search success has brought him and relishing the hard-won recognition . " i always felt that there was something big inside me and it was disappointing since no one seemed to know it except for me and my wife , " doyle laughed .

german chancellor gerhard schröder says he ’ s going to run for third term in 2006 with foreign minister joschka fischer as his co-pilot .
the decision ends speculation fischer may be headed for brussels . in a surprise move thursday , a german chancellor gerhard schröder confirmed he and foreign minister joschka fischer plan to run for a third term in the 2006 national election .
the announcement comes amid a steep drop in popularity ratings for schröder 's social democrats as the attempt to implement painful economic and social reforms .
in taking the decision , the green party 's fischer has abandoned any intention of becoming a candidate for the future office of european union foreign minister in brussels - at least for now .
in an interview televised thursday night , schröder sought to assuage critics who complained he had taken too long to make up his mind .
" i could have announced my decision at an earlier stage , " he said , " but then you have to consider that such a move gravely affects one ’ s personal life and my family , and it had to be carefully coordinated with my party first .
this is why i didn ’ t rush things . "
difficult reforms the social democrats have suffered a free-fall in popularity since the general election last september due to at least in part their inability to effectively articulate their economic and social reform drive to the public . the party now trails the conservative opposition by as much as 14 percentage points in public opinion polls .
the government ’ s planned cuts in the country ’ s welfare system have alienated many of the party 's core voters .
by announcing his decision to stand again , the chancellor obviously wanted to send out a signal that he does not intend to pass on the buck to someone else when it comes to implementing his difficult reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz in a hastily convened press conference , spd general secretary olaf scholz welcomed the move .
" there ’ s wide-spread agreement in our party that we want to win the 2006 election again , " he said .
" with gerhard schröder at the helm , it worked well twice in the past , and it will work again in 2006 with him – and only with him . "
schröder first took office in 1998 in a coalition with the environmentalist greens .
voters reelected the same coalition last september by the narrowest margin in germany ’ s post-war history .
in the past few years , schröder repeatedly insisted he would only serve until 2006 , saying that eight years in office would be a sufficient amount of time .
but in recent weeks , the chancellor had been less outspoken when asked about the possibility of running for a third term , largely due to the lack of a viable successor within his party .
there has been considerable speculation in recent months that schröder might send fischer to brussels to take either the post of eu foreign minister if the constitution calling for the position is passed by eu member countries .
barring that development , fischer would also have been a serious candidate for a post on the european commission in brussels , which will be replace its existing commissioners in 2004 .
opposition to circle wagons unsettled by schröder ’ s plan to run again , opposition politicians are already battening down the hatches for a tough campaign .
guido westerwelle , who leads the neo-liberal free democratic party , called schröder ’ s plan to seek reelection a " menace to society " and pledged to thwart schröder ’ s candidacy .

" germany is grappling with enormous problems in reforming the economy and its social system , " said the party ’ s general secretary , laurenz meyer .
" and the chancellor has nothing to do but publicly moot his own political future .
what a disgrace !
you can not help but conclude that he ’ s out to deceive the public and distract from the country ’ s current economic woes . "

this is why i didn ’ t rush things . "
difficult reforms the social democrats have suffered a free-fall in popularity since the general election last september due to at least in part their inability to effectively articulate their economic and social reform drive to the public . the party now trails the conservative opposition by as much as 14 percentage points in public opinion polls .
the government ’ s planned cuts in the country ’ s welfare system have alienated many of the party 's core voters .
by announcing his decision to stand again , the chancellor obviously wanted to send out a signal that he does not intend to pass on the buck to someone else when it comes to implementing his difficult reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz in a hastily convened press conference , spd general secretary olaf scholz welcomed the move .
" there ’ s wide-spread agreement in our party that we want to win the 2006 election again , " he said .
" with gerhard schröder at the helm , it worked well twice in the past , and it will work again in 2006 with him – and only with him . "
schröder first took office in 1998 in a coalition with the environmentalist greens .
voters reelected the same coalition last september by the narrowest margin in germany ’ s post-war history .
in the past few years , schröder repeatedly insisted he would only serve until 2006 , saying that eight years in office would be a sufficient amount of time .
but in recent weeks , the chancellor had been less outspoken when asked about the possibility of running for a third term , largely due to the lack of a viable successor within his party .
there has been considerable speculation in recent months that schröder might send fischer to brussels to take either the post of eu foreign minister if the constitution calling for the position is passed by eu member countries .
barring that development , fischer would also have been a serious candidate for a post on the european commission in brussels , which will be replace its existing commissioners in 2004 .
opposition to circle wagons unsettled by schröder ’ s plan to run again , opposition politicians are already battening down the hatches for a tough campaign .
guido westerwelle , who leads the neo-liberal free democratic party , called schröder ’ s plan to seek reelection a " menace to society " and pledged to thwart schröder ’ s candidacy .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also took shots at schröder .
" germany is grappling with enormous problems in reforming the economy and its social system , " said the party ’ s general secretary , laurenz meyer .
" and the chancellor has nothing to do but publicly moot his own political future .
what a disgrace !
you can not help but conclude that he ’ s out to deceive the public and distract from the country ’ s current economic woes . "
despite his current political woes there is still good news for the chancellor : the social democrats maybe be wallowing in public opinion polls , but a recent survey by the forsa institute found that 51 percent of germans would still support a third schröder candidacy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read dw-world 's complete archive of 2002 election coverage - with profiles of politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.08.2003 germany to violate deficit rules for second year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin will have to cut back public spending to bring the budget in line with eu rules .
the german finance ministry admitted on friday deficit spending in berlin will exceed euro stability pact limits for a second year in a row .
if eu budgetary limits are breeched next year , brussels may impose sanctions . although the news was long expected , finance minister hans eichel officially confirmed friday that german public deficit spending would exceed the limit set forth in the maastricht treaty for the second year in a row .
but with an estimated budget deficit hitting 3.8 percent of gross domestic product for 2003 , berlin delivered a figure higher than previously expected . only as recently as july , the ministry was still forecasting maximum deficit spending of 3.5 percent – the same amount germany booked last year .
but as germany ’ s economy has stalled this year , the government has been required to borrow more . german finance minister hans eichel attributed the deficit prognosis to the " still restrained national economic developments that have created additional burdens for the labor market . "
the deficit has also been compounded by a decrease in tax revenues , which the government said were lower in summer than spring . in the run-up to the announcement , german chancellor gerhard schröder began a campaign in the media seeking to persuade brussels to interpret the maastricht rules more loosely .

the german finance ministry admitted on friday deficit spending in berlin will exceed euro stability pact limits for a second year in a row .
if eu budgetary limits are breeched next year , brussels may impose sanctions . although the news was long expected , finance minister hans eichel officially confirmed friday that german public deficit spending would exceed the limit set forth in the maastricht treaty for the second year in a row .
but with an estimated budget deficit hitting 3.8 percent of gross domestic product for 2003 , berlin delivered a figure higher than previously expected . only as recently as july , the ministry was still forecasting maximum deficit spending of 3.5 percent – the same amount germany booked last year .
but as germany ’ s economy has stalled this year , the government has been required to borrow more . german finance minister hans eichel attributed the deficit prognosis to the " still restrained national economic developments that have created additional burdens for the labor market . "
the deficit has also been compounded by a decrease in tax revenues , which the government said were lower in summer than spring . in the run-up to the announcement , german chancellor gerhard schröder began a campaign in the media seeking to persuade brussels to interpret the maastricht rules more loosely .
though germany is home to the largest economy within the eu , it is also currently the weakest .

one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .
john doyle has been working to make germans laugh for eight years .
his efforts have paid off and he 's achieved national recognition . john doyle has been through more than a few trying times in his eight-year relationship with stand-up comedy .
he remembers his first solo show in cologne , where he had to perform for 90 minutes .
he got exactly two laughs . " and even then the audience was n't laughing at my jokes , but at my one-year-old son who 'd decided to take a stroll across the stage , " he told deutsche welle . then there was the time at a rock music festival when he followed a music act .
one minute into his routine and the beer bottles and curses started flying .
five minutes later , he literally ran for his life from the stage . " i almost needed therapy after that , " he said . how times change .
last month , doyle stood on stage at star search , a televised talent show of sorts , and performed to an audience of 3.1 million .
they loved him .
he moved steadily ahead in the competition , leaving his native-born competitors in the dust .
during the final , some 5.5 million tuned in . those flying beer bottles are but a distant memory , since today its contracts and acclaim that are hurtling his way .
while he did n't win the star search final , he did mightily impress germany 's comedy community . " that 's the best that i 've seen in a long time , " said hugo egon balder , one of germany 's leading comedy promoters and a star search jury members . now doyle has now been asked to be one of the headliners for blue monday , a show on german television which features up-and-coming talent .
two days later there 's a comedy festival and back to back gigs .
all of the sudden , the once struggling american comedian who almost begged for bookings at rotary club meetings is having to turn down offers . masochistic tendencies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john doyle doyle admits doing comedy in germany , in german , is not the easiest job in the world , and not what he thought he would be doing when he came to germany twelve years ago for a language course .

still , some aspects of life here were hard to get used to . " germany is more serious than america in some ways , especially in daily life , " he said .
" i needed some levity , so i started to make jokes about life here , basically using comedy as a way of dealing with my reality . " as his command of the language improved , he decided to go public with his jokes , which often deal with being caught somewhere in the middle of germany and america .
he says he feels like something of an outsider to both cultures , a condition that might lead to low-level psychic trauma at times , but puts him in an ideal place to make droll observations about the absurdities in both societies . " i mean , if i see someone standing at a deserted street corner at 2:00 a.m. waiting for the light to change before he crosses the street , i 'm going to grab that , because an american would n't do that , " he said .
" a german probably would n't pick up on the humor in that picture . " not that different while the cliché of the humourless german might still be alive and kicking , doyle says it 's not that much harder to get germans to laugh than it is to get americans to bust a gut .
both audiences are demanding , he said , and want clever material that they can relate to in some way .
the trick , he said , is simple in theory and extremely difficult in practice : figuring out what they find funny . there are some differences though .
while topics around sex are often good for a laugh , german audiences wo n't go as far as their american counterparts .
doyle says there are still taboos in germany that have mostly faded in the u.s. and if a comedian ventures too far , accusations of being crude and hitting below the belt are quick to fly . on the other hand , since germans can have a more relaxed attitude towards sex over all than the average american , jokes that a u.s. audience would find risqué and therefore funny can fall flat in germany . " the response is sometimes like - so what ? "
doyle said . the funny american being known primarily as " that funny american guy " has been both good and bad for doyle 's comedy career .

he says because he 's not german , he is n't under the same constraints . " you 're not breaking rules , because the rules do n't apply to you , " he said .

in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , walther recalled his ordeal . reto walther was one of 13 tourists freed by their captors in mali after nearly six months on august 19 .
since the group - including nine germans , four swiss and one dutch national - returned home , politicians in germany have discussed the possibility of requiring the hostages to help foot the bill for the efforts to release them . a total of 32 european vacationers were seized in separate incidents in february and march this year in southern algeria , where they were traveling .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may by killing their kidnappers , who belonged to the salafist group for preaching and combat islamist extremist group .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 . in an interview with deutsche welle , 31-year-old walther discussed his experience as a hostage . mr. walther , how are you faring after the long period in captivity ? i 'm quite surprised myself .
i 'm actually doing well .
i 'm healthy .
i 'm also happy to be home .
i 've still got an adrenaline high .
i 'm happy to be together with my wife and that keeps me full of energy . do you plan to seek professional help after this ordeal ?
you were part of the group that had to bury michaela spitzer in the middle of the night after she died of heatstroke , and you yourself held the eulogy .
how are you dealing with the trauma ? i actually feel relatively strong , perhaps too strong for some people .
but i 've also been persuaded to get professional help .
i 'm looking for the right place .
in any case , i will want to address this problem with professional help . mr. walther , on march 19 the kidnappers gave you a radio and you were able to follow the progress of efforts for your release .
did this umbilical cord - if you 'll permit the expression - help or did it intensify the feeling of powerlessness ?
you heard about search parties that may have been nearby , but you could n't contact them . that 's right .
of course , it was a very , very difficult situation for the whole group .
i can remember one evening where we heard that people were asking whether we had just got lost in the desert or whether we were the victims of a crime .
and i also remember that the mood was very , very low that evening .
then later , when the radio - deutsche welle - reported that search parties were en route , that people were looking for us from the air , the mood naturally improved and expectations increased as well . we were all very happy about the radio .
that 's how we heard about the war in iraq and then also about the other group that had been kidnapped that was later freed .
we heard that too .
we were happy for them , but we were disappointed that the other group was freed and not us . we only considered two radio broadcasters reliable , not just us hostages but also our kidnappers .
those were deutsche welle and i think a moroccan or french broadcaster that aired in french .
but we were always happy that we could receive deutsche welle at all because it broadcast really objective , good news .
hats off , really . did the kidnappers tell you why they took away the radio after three months ? they did n't give a reason .
the order came from the group 's highest leader .
i think it was due to reasons of security . there has been much speculation about the kidnappers motives .
they were split into two groups - the radicals and then there were those who slipped you food sometimes , who also apologized to you for the kidnapping .
to what extent did you see the kidnapping as being political - or was the main objective ransom money ? that 's a difficult question that i ca n't really answer .
my feeling says it is a politically motivated group that presumably just wanted money to buy something to be more mobile again with the help of this crime .
i think ultimately we were n't a political motive .
but that 's an assumption and not really well-founded . what will you do next ?
will you start to work again soon ?
will you travel to the sahara again ? i wo n't travel to the sahara for two reasons .
for one , it 's too unsafe there for me and secondly , my wife in pregnant .
i did n't know that for a long time during the kidnapping .

one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .
john doyle has been working to make germans laugh for eight years .
his efforts have paid off and he 's achieved national recognition . john doyle has been through more than a few trying times in his eight-year relationship with stand-up comedy .
he remembers his first solo show in cologne , where he had to perform for 90 minutes .
he got exactly two laughs . " and even then the audience was n't laughing at my jokes , but at my one-year-old son who 'd decided to take a stroll across the stage , " he told deutsche welle . then there was the time at a rock music festival when he followed a music act .
one minute into his routine and the beer bottles and curses started flying .
five minutes later , he literally ran for his life from the stage . " i almost needed therapy after that , " he said . how times change .
last month , doyle stood on stage at star search , a televised talent show of sorts , and performed to an audience of 3.1 million .
they loved him .
he moved steadily ahead in the competition , leaving his native-born competitors in the dust .
during the final , some 5.5 million tuned in . those flying beer bottles are but a distant memory , since today its contracts and acclaim that are hurtling his way .
while he did n't win the star search final , he did mightily impress germany 's comedy community . " that 's the best that i 've seen in a long time , " said hugo egon balder , one of germany 's leading comedy promoters and a star search jury members . now doyle has now been asked to be one of the headliners for blue monday , a show on german television which features up-and-coming talent .
two days later there 's a comedy festival and back to back gigs .
all of the sudden , the once struggling american comedian who almost begged for bookings at rotary club meetings is having to turn down offers . masochistic tendencies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john doyle doyle admits doing comedy in germany , in german , is not the easiest job in the world , and not what he thought he would be doing when he came to germany twelve years ago for a language course .
he stayed , married a german and had a child .
still , some aspects of life here were hard to get used to . " germany is more serious than america in some ways , especially in daily life , " he said .
" i needed some levity , so i started to make jokes about life here , basically using comedy as a way of dealing with my reality . " as his command of the language improved , he decided to go public with his jokes , which often deal with being caught somewhere in the middle of germany and america .
he says he feels like something of an outsider to both cultures , a condition that might lead to low-level psychic trauma at times , but puts him in an ideal place to make droll observations about the absurdities in both societies . " i mean , if i see someone standing at a deserted street corner at 2:00 a.m. waiting for the light to change before he crosses the street , i 'm going to grab that , because an american would n't do that , " he said .
" a german probably would n't pick up on the humor in that picture . " not that different while the cliché of the humourless german might still be alive and kicking , doyle says it 's not that much harder to get germans to laugh than it is to get americans to bust a gut .
both audiences are demanding , he said , and want clever material that they can relate to in some way .
the trick , he said , is simple in theory and extremely difficult in practice : figuring out what they find funny . there are some differences though .
while topics around sex are often good for a laugh , german audiences wo n't go as far as their american counterparts .
doyle says there are still taboos in germany that have mostly faded in the u.s. and if a comedian ventures too far , accusations of being crude and hitting below the belt are quick to fly . on the other hand , since germans can have a more relaxed attitude towards sex over all than the average american , jokes that a u.s. audience would find risqué and therefore funny can fall flat in germany . " the response is sometimes like - so what ? "
doyle said . the funny american being known primarily as " that funny american guy " has been both good and bad for doyle 's comedy career .
his foreignness has given him more license to try out material that germans might not get away with .
he says because he 's not german , he is n't under the same constraints . " you 're not breaking rules , because the rules do n't apply to you , " he said .
" people just laugh and think , look at john , that weird american . " at the same time , there are downsides .
he lacks some of the common frames of reference that his german colleagues share with their audiences .
and since he is so strongly identified as an american , he is limited to stand-up gigs .
sketch comedy , popular on german television right now , is not an option for him .
he could n't just play a taxi driver or the henpecked husband because the audience would n't accept it . but he can live with that .
stand-up is his love and he 's hoping it 's going to take him to his own show one of these days .
right now he 's basking in the attention his star search success has brought him and relishing the hard-won recognition . " i always felt that there was something big inside me and it was disappointing since no one seemed to know it except for me and my wife , " doyle laughed .
" it 's exciting to know that i was n't completely deluding myself all those years .

one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .
john doyle has been working to make germans laugh for eight years .
his efforts have paid off and he 's achieved national recognition . john doyle has been through more than a few trying times in his eight-year relationship with stand-up comedy .
he remembers his first solo show in cologne , where he had to perform for 90 minutes .
he got exactly two laughs . " and even then the audience was n't laughing at my jokes , but at my one-year-old son who 'd decided to take a stroll across the stage , " he told deutsche welle . then there was the time at a rock music festival when he followed a music act .
one minute into his routine and the beer bottles and curses started flying .
five minutes later , he literally ran for his life from the stage . " i almost needed therapy after that , " he said . how times change .
last month , doyle stood on stage at star search , a televised talent show of sorts , and performed to an audience of 3.1 million .
they loved him .
he moved steadily ahead in the competition , leaving his native-born competitors in the dust .
during the final , some 5.5 million tuned in . those flying beer bottles are but a distant memory , since today its contracts and acclaim that are hurtling his way .
while he did n't win the star search final , he did mightily impress germany 's comedy community . " that 's the best that i 've seen in a long time , " said hugo egon balder , one of germany 's leading comedy promoters and a star search jury members . now doyle has now been asked to be one of the headliners for blue monday , a show on german television which features up-and-coming talent .
two days later there 's a comedy festival and back to back gigs .
all of the sudden , the once struggling american comedian who almost begged for bookings at rotary club meetings is having to turn down offers . masochistic tendencies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john doyle doyle admits doing comedy in germany , in german , is not the easiest job in the world , and not what he thought he would be doing when he came to germany twelve years ago for a language course .
he stayed , married a german and had a child .
still , some aspects of life here were hard to get used to . " germany is more serious than america in some ways , especially in daily life , " he said .
" i needed some levity , so i started to make jokes about life here , basically using comedy as a way of dealing with my reality . " as his command of the language improved , he decided to go public with his jokes , which often deal with being caught somewhere in the middle of germany and america .
he says he feels like something of an outsider to both cultures , a condition that might lead to low-level psychic trauma at times , but puts him in an ideal place to make droll observations about the absurdities in both societies . " i mean , if i see someone standing at a deserted street corner at 2:00 a.m. waiting for the light to change before he crosses the street , i 'm going to grab that , because an american would n't do that , " he said .
" a german probably would n't pick up on the humor in that picture . " not that different while the cliché of the humourless german might still be alive and kicking , doyle says it 's not that much harder to get germans to laugh than it is to get americans to bust a gut .
both audiences are demanding , he said , and want clever material that they can relate to in some way .
the trick , he said , is simple in theory and extremely difficult in practice : figuring out what they find funny . there are some differences though .
while topics around sex are often good for a laugh , german audiences wo n't go as far as their american counterparts .
doyle says there are still taboos in germany that have mostly faded in the u.s. and if a comedian ventures too far , accusations of being crude and hitting below the belt are quick to fly . on the other hand , since germans can have a more relaxed attitude towards sex over all than the average american , jokes that a u.s. audience would find risqué and therefore funny can fall flat in germany . " the response is sometimes like - so what ? "
doyle said . the funny american being known primarily as " that funny american guy " has been both good and bad for doyle 's comedy career .
his foreignness has given him more license to try out material that germans might not get away with .
he says because he 's not german , he is n't under the same constraints . " you 're not breaking rules , because the rules do n't apply to you , " he said .
" people just laugh and think , look at john , that weird american . " at the same time , there are downsides .
he lacks some of the common frames of reference that his german colleagues share with their audiences .
and since he is so strongly identified as an american , he is limited to stand-up gigs .
sketch comedy , popular on german television right now , is not an option for him .
he could n't just play a taxi driver or the henpecked husband because the audience would n't accept it . but he can live with that .
stand-up is his love and he 's hoping it 's going to take him to his own show one of these days .
right now he 's basking in the attention his star search success has brought him and relishing the hard-won recognition . " i always felt that there was something big inside me and it was disappointing since no one seemed to know it except for me and my wife , " doyle laughed .
" it 's exciting to know that i was n't completely deluding myself all those years .

a libyan charitable organization has offered to begin negotiations with the families of victims of those killed and injured in the 1986 bombing of the la belle nightclub in berlin . the gaddafi international foundation for charitable organisations , a body headed by the son of libyan leader muammar gaddafi , announced on thursday that it intends to compensate victims of the bombing of the “ la belle ” nightclub in berlin in 1986 , in which three people died .
in its statement issued in the german capital , the charity called the decision a " gesture of humanity " while insisting that the pledge was not an admission of libyan state involvement in the attack on the disco which was popular with u.s. soldiers .
" this humanitarian initiative is not recognition or acceptance of responsibility for this act from any side whatsoever . "
charity offer independent from government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan president colonel muammar gaddafi .
the statement from the group 's berlin office added that officials from the charity hope to meet victims and their families to reach a quick and simple solution .
however , the foundation declined to detail the specifics of the planned compensation package but a spokesman told reuters that the payments would not include any money from the libyan state , adding that the charity , which is led by saif al islam , colonel gaddafi 's son , is an independent organization .
a group campaigning for compensation for the victims said it welcomed thursday ’ s statement .
lawyers representing non-american victims said they were seeking € 500,000 for each injured person .

in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , walther recalled his ordeal . reto walther was one of 13 tourists freed by their captors in mali after nearly six months on august 19 .
since the group - including nine germans , four swiss and one dutch national - returned home , politicians in germany have discussed the possibility of requiring the hostages to help foot the bill for the efforts to release them . a total of 32 european vacationers were seized in separate incidents in february and march this year in southern algeria , where they were traveling .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may by killing their kidnappers , who belonged to the salafist group for preaching and combat islamist extremist group .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 . in an interview with deutsche welle , 31-year-old walther discussed his experience as a hostage . mr. walther , how are you faring after the long period in captivity ? i 'm quite surprised myself .
i 'm actually doing well .
i 'm healthy .
i 'm also happy to be home .
i 've still got an adrenaline high .
i 'm happy to be together with my wife and that keeps me full of energy . do you plan to seek professional help after this ordeal ?
you were part of the group that had to bury michaela spitzer in the middle of the night after she died of heatstroke , and you yourself held the eulogy .
how are you dealing with the trauma ? i actually feel relatively strong , perhaps too strong for some people .
but i 've also been persuaded to get professional help .
i 'm looking for the right place .
in any case , i will want to address this problem with professional help . mr. walther , on march 19 the kidnappers gave you a radio and you were able to follow the progress of efforts for your release .
did this umbilical cord - if you 'll permit the expression - help or did it intensify the feeling of powerlessness ?
you heard about search parties that may have been nearby , but you could n't contact them . that 's right .
of course , it was a very , very difficult situation for the whole group .
i can remember one evening where we heard that people were asking whether we had just got lost in the desert or whether we were the victims of a crime .
and i also remember that the mood was very , very low that evening .
then later , when the radio - deutsche welle - reported that search parties were en route , that people were looking for us from the air , the mood naturally improved and expectations increased as well . we were all very happy about the radio .
that 's how we heard about the war in iraq and then also about the other group that had been kidnapped that was later freed .
we heard that too .
we were happy for them , but we were disappointed that the other group was freed and not us . we only considered two radio broadcasters reliable , not just us hostages but also our kidnappers .
those were deutsche welle and i think a moroccan or french broadcaster that aired in french .
but we were always happy that we could receive deutsche welle at all because it broadcast really objective , good news .
hats off , really . did the kidnappers tell you why they took away the radio after three months ? they did n't give a reason .
the order came from the group 's highest leader .
i think it was due to reasons of security . there has been much speculation about the kidnappers motives .
they were split into two groups - the radicals and then there were those who slipped you food sometimes , who also apologized to you for the kidnapping .
to what extent did you see the kidnapping as being political - or was the main objective ransom money ? that 's a difficult question that i ca n't really answer .
my feeling says it is a politically motivated group that presumably just wanted money to buy something to be more mobile again with the help of this crime .
i think ultimately we were n't a political motive .
but that 's an assumption and not really well-founded . what will you do next ?
will you start to work again soon ?
will you travel to the sahara again ? i wo n't travel to the sahara for two reasons .
for one , it 's too unsafe there for me and secondly , my wife in pregnant .
i did n't know that for a long time during the kidnapping .
we are expecting our first child in november , and i will have an entirely new role as a father , which i 'm very happy about .
life will return to normal .
i will be able to work again next week , i hope .
i think it 's important for me to get back into everyday , regular life . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government says sahara hostages shouldn ’ t profit from ordeal the german government has warned the 14 tourists released from kidnappers in the sahara desert against profiting from their experiences there , saying they should give any money earned from their story back to the state .

a libyan charitable organization has offered to begin negotiations with the families of victims of those killed and injured in the 1986 bombing of the la belle nightclub in berlin . the gaddafi international foundation for charitable organisations , a body headed by the son of libyan leader muammar gaddafi , announced on thursday that it intends to compensate victims of the bombing of the “ la belle ” nightclub in berlin in 1986 , in which three people died .
in its statement issued in the german capital , the charity called the decision a " gesture of humanity " while insisting that the pledge was not an admission of libyan state involvement in the attack on the disco which was popular with u.s. soldiers .
" this humanitarian initiative is not recognition or acceptance of responsibility for this act from any side whatsoever . "

german chancellor gerhard schröder says he ’ s going to run for third term in 2006 with foreign minister joschka fischer as his co-pilot .
the decision ends speculation fischer may be headed for brussels . in a surprise move thursday , a german chancellor gerhard schröder confirmed he and foreign minister joschka fischer plan to run for a third term in the 2006 national election .
the announcement comes amid a steep drop in popularity ratings for schröder 's social democrats as the attempt to implement painful economic and social reforms .
in taking the decision , the green party 's fischer has abandoned any intention of becoming a candidate for the future office of european union foreign minister in brussels - at least for now .
in an interview televised thursday night , schröder sought to assuage critics who complained he had taken too long to make up his mind .
" i could have announced my decision at an earlier stage , " he said , " but then you have to consider that such a move gravely affects one ’ s personal life and my family , and it had to be carefully coordinated with my party first .
this is why i didn ’ t rush things . "
difficult reforms the social democrats have suffered a free-fall in popularity since the general election last september due to at least in part their inability to effectively articulate their economic and social reform drive to the public . the party now trails the conservative opposition by as much as 14 percentage points in public opinion polls .
the government ’ s planned cuts in the country ’ s welfare system have alienated many of the party 's core voters .
by announcing his decision to stand again , the chancellor obviously wanted to send out a signal that he does not intend to pass on the buck to someone else when it comes to implementing his difficult reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz in a hastily convened press conference , spd general secretary olaf scholz welcomed the move .
" there ’ s wide-spread agreement in our party that we want to win the 2006 election again , " he said .
" with gerhard schröder at the helm , it worked well twice in the past , and it will work again in 2006 with him – and only with him . "
schröder first took office in 1998 in a coalition with the environmentalist greens .
voters reelected the same coalition last september by the narrowest margin in germany ’ s post-war history .
in the past few years , schröder repeatedly insisted he would only serve until 2006 , saying that eight years in office would be a sufficient amount of time .
but in recent weeks , the chancellor had been less outspoken when asked about the possibility of running for a third term , largely due to the lack of a viable successor within his party .
there has been considerable speculation in recent months that schröder might send fischer to brussels to take either the post of eu foreign minister if the constitution calling for the position is passed by eu member countries .
barring that development , fischer would also have been a serious candidate for a post on the european commission in brussels , which will be replace its existing commissioners in 2004 .
opposition to circle wagons unsettled by schröder ’ s plan to run again , opposition politicians are already battening down the hatches for a tough campaign .
guido westerwelle , who leads the neo-liberal free democratic party , called schröder ’ s plan to seek reelection a " menace to society " and pledged to thwart schröder ’ s candidacy .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also took shots at schröder .
" germany is grappling with enormous problems in reforming the economy and its social system , " said the party ’ s general secretary , laurenz meyer .
" and the chancellor has nothing to do but publicly moot his own political future .
what a disgrace !
you can not help but conclude that he ’ s out to deceive the public and distract from the country ’ s current economic woes . "
despite his current political woes there is still good news for the chancellor : the social democrats maybe be wallowing in public opinion polls , but a recent survey by the forsa institute found that 51 percent of germans would still support a third schröder candidacy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery read dw-world 's complete archive of 2002 election coverage - with profiles of politicians , parties and hot-button issues , along with a dummy 's guide to the german political system . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

according to a report in the british broadsheet the guardian , officials from the uk will tell their eu colleagues that any planning for european military operations must be carried out strictly under the auspices of the atlantic alliance . there have already been calls from paris , echoed by some voices within brussels , for the european union to co-ordinate and mount its own military operations through a " european military force . "
belgium and luxembourg are also in favor of the force and join germany and france in the so-called " gang of four " - the name given to the eu countries that opposed the u.s.-led invasion of iraq by pro-nato critics of the plan . eu force could anger the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato .
on the surface , britain agrees that the eu should be able to plan its own operations , but only from nato ’ s headquarters near mons in belgium .
however , british officials are warning their eu counterparts that the franco-german initiative will antagonize the united states and create unnecessary duplication between the eu and nato . many detractors see the idea of forming an eu force as an empty gesture after the divisions of the iraq crisis and some , britain in particular , are angry that it is still being pursued . ironically , the idea of eu defense was pioneered by britain and france after the end of the kosovo war in 1999 , a conflict which showed in glaring detail the huge gap between europe and the united states in terms of military might . current peacekeeping duties would increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , the eu has succeeded in creating new institutions and procedures and has deployed troops in peacekeeping missions in macedonia and congo .
plans to create a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force are also under way .
but anything larger will meet stiff resistance from british prime minister tony blair ’ s government . defense is one of the most controversial items in the eu 's draft constitution , which is due to be finalized in negotiations between all 15 member states starting in october .
if blair continues to oppose the formation of the force , he can count on the support of other nato loyalists such as the netherlands , poland , spain and denmark as well as neutral or non-aligned states .
with considerable disagreement about how to mould a common eu defense policy , the timing is far from optimal for planning such a force . compromise could make things worse any compromise is unlikely to break the deadlock completely .
sources quoted in the guardian report suggest that the french may agree on the british proposal for a " dedicated eu planning cell " without the military force to back it up but will give up any of their own ambitions to form an army to carry out the cell ’ s operations . the result could be an even worse situation where an eu “ trojan horse ” operates within nato while the eu expands and duplicates its own military structures outside it , some critics have warned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rapid reaction force ready by year 's end the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered .

in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , walther recalled his ordeal . reto walther was one of 13 tourists freed by their captors in mali after nearly six months on august 19 .
since the group - including nine germans , four swiss and one dutch national - returned home , politicians in germany have discussed the possibility of requiring the hostages to help foot the bill for the efforts to release them . a total of 32 european vacationers were seized in separate incidents in february and march this year in southern algeria , where they were traveling .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may by killing their kidnappers , who belonged to the salafist group for preaching and combat islamist extremist group .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 . in an interview with deutsche welle , 31-year-old walther discussed his experience as a hostage . mr. walther , how are you faring after the long period in captivity ? i 'm quite surprised myself .
i 'm actually doing well .
i 'm healthy .
i 'm also happy to be home .
i 've still got an adrenaline high .
i 'm happy to be together with my wife and that keeps me full of energy . do you plan to seek professional help after this ordeal ?
you were part of the group that had to bury michaela spitzer in the middle of the night after she died of heatstroke , and you yourself held the eulogy .
how are you dealing with the trauma ? i actually feel relatively strong , perhaps too strong for some people .
but i 've also been persuaded to get professional help .
i 'm looking for the right place .
in any case , i will want to address this problem with professional help . mr. walther , on march 19 the kidnappers gave you a radio and you were able to follow the progress of efforts for your release .
did this umbilical cord - if you 'll permit the expression - help or did it intensify the feeling of powerlessness ?
you heard about search parties that may have been nearby , but you could n't contact them . that 's right .
of course , it was a very , very difficult situation for the whole group .
i can remember one evening where we heard that people were asking whether we had just got lost in the desert or whether we were the victims of a crime .
and i also remember that the mood was very , very low that evening .
then later , when the radio - deutsche welle - reported that search parties were en route , that people were looking for us from the air , the mood naturally improved and expectations increased as well . we were all very happy about the radio .
that 's how we heard about the war in iraq and then also about the other group that had been kidnapped that was later freed .
we heard that too .
we were happy for them , but we were disappointed that the other group was freed and not us . we only considered two radio broadcasters reliable , not just us hostages but also our kidnappers .
those were deutsche welle and i think a moroccan or french broadcaster that aired in french .
but we were always happy that we could receive deutsche welle at all because it broadcast really objective , good news .
hats off , really . did the kidnappers tell you why they took away the radio after three months ? they did n't give a reason .
the order came from the group 's highest leader .
i think it was due to reasons of security . there has been much speculation about the kidnappers motives .
they were split into two groups - the radicals and then there were those who slipped you food sometimes , who also apologized to you for the kidnapping .
to what extent did you see the kidnapping as being political - or was the main objective ransom money ? that 's a difficult question that i ca n't really answer .
my feeling says it is a politically motivated group that presumably just wanted money to buy something to be more mobile again with the help of this crime .
i think ultimately we were n't a political motive .
but that 's an assumption and not really well-founded . what will you do next ?
will you start to work again soon ?
will you travel to the sahara again ? i wo n't travel to the sahara for two reasons .
for one , it 's too unsafe there for me and secondly , my wife in pregnant .
i did n't know that for a long time during the kidnapping .
we are expecting our first child in november , and i will have an entirely new role as a father , which i 'm very happy about .

german chancellor gerhard schröder says he ’ s going to run for third term in 2006 with foreign minister joschka fischer as his co-pilot .
the decision ends speculation fischer may be headed for brussels . in a surprise move thursday , a german chancellor gerhard schröder confirmed he and foreign minister joschka fischer plan to run for a third term in the 2006 national election .
the announcement comes amid a steep drop in popularity ratings for schröder 's social democrats as the attempt to implement painful economic and social reforms .
in taking the decision , the green party 's fischer has abandoned any intention of becoming a candidate for the future office of european union foreign minister in brussels - at least for now .
in an interview televised thursday night , schröder sought to assuage critics who complained he had taken too long to make up his mind .
" i could have announced my decision at an earlier stage , " he said , " but then you have to consider that such a move gravely affects one ’ s personal life and my family , and it had to be carefully coordinated with my party first .
this is why i didn ’ t rush things . "
difficult reforms the social democrats have suffered a free-fall in popularity since the general election last september due to at least in part their inability to effectively articulate their economic and social reform drive to the public . the party now trails the conservative opposition by as much as 14 percentage points in public opinion polls .
the government ’ s planned cuts in the country ’ s welfare system have alienated many of the party 's core voters .
by announcing his decision to stand again , the chancellor obviously wanted to send out a signal that he does not intend to pass on the buck to someone else when it comes to implementing his difficult reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz in a hastily convened press conference , spd general secretary olaf scholz welcomed the move .
" there ’ s wide-spread agreement in our party that we want to win the 2006 election again , " he said .
" with gerhard schröder at the helm , it worked well twice in the past , and it will work again in 2006 with him – and only with him . "
schröder first took office in 1998 in a coalition with the environmentalist greens .
voters reelected the same coalition last september by the narrowest margin in germany ’ s post-war history .
in the past few years , schröder repeatedly insisted he would only serve until 2006 , saying that eight years in office would be a sufficient amount of time .
but in recent weeks , the chancellor had been less outspoken when asked about the possibility of running for a third term , largely due to the lack of a viable successor within his party .
there has been considerable speculation in recent months that schröder might send fischer to brussels to take either the post of eu foreign minister if the constitution calling for the position is passed by eu member countries .
barring that development , fischer would also have been a serious candidate for a post on the european commission in brussels , which will be replace its existing commissioners in 2004 .
opposition to circle wagons unsettled by schröder ’ s plan to run again , opposition politicians are already battening down the hatches for a tough campaign .
guido westerwelle , who leads the neo-liberal free democratic party , called schröder ’ s plan to seek reelection a " menace to society " and pledged to thwart schröder ’ s candidacy .
the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- also took shots at schröder .
" germany is grappling with enormous problems in reforming the economy and its social system , " said the party ’ s general secretary , laurenz meyer .
" and the chancellor has nothing to do but publicly moot his own political future .

german chancellor gerhard schröder says he ’ s going to run for third term in 2006 with foreign minister joschka fischer as his co-pilot .
the decision ends speculation fischer may be headed for brussels . in a surprise move thursday , a german chancellor gerhard schröder confirmed he and foreign minister joschka fischer plan to run for a third term in the 2006 national election .
the announcement comes amid a steep drop in popularity ratings for schröder 's social democrats as the attempt to implement painful economic and social reforms .
in taking the decision , the green party 's fischer has abandoned any intention of becoming a candidate for the future office of european union foreign minister in brussels - at least for now .
in an interview televised thursday night , schröder sought to assuage critics who complained he had taken too long to make up his mind .
" i could have announced my decision at an earlier stage , " he said , " but then you have to consider that such a move gravely affects one ’ s personal life and my family , and it had to be carefully coordinated with my party first .
this is why i didn ’ t rush things . "
difficult reforms the social democrats have suffered a free-fall in popularity since the general election last september due to at least in part their inability to effectively articulate their economic and social reform drive to the public . the party now trails the conservative opposition by as much as 14 percentage points in public opinion polls .
the government ’ s planned cuts in the country ’ s welfare system have alienated many of the party 's core voters .
by announcing his decision to stand again , the chancellor obviously wanted to send out a signal that he does not intend to pass on the buck to someone else when it comes to implementing his difficult reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olaf scholz in a hastily convened press conference , spd general secretary olaf scholz welcomed the move .
" there ’ s wide-spread agreement in our party that we want to win the 2006 election again , " he said .
" with gerhard schröder at the helm , it worked well twice in the past , and it will work again in 2006 with him – and only with him . "
schröder first took office in 1998 in a coalition with the environmentalist greens .
voters reelected the same coalition last september by the narrowest margin in germany ’ s post-war history .
in the past few years , schröder repeatedly insisted he would only serve until 2006 , saying that eight years in office would be a sufficient amount of time .
but in recent weeks , the chancellor had been less outspoken when asked about the possibility of running for a third term , largely due to the lack of a viable successor within his party .
there has been considerable speculation in recent months that schröder might send fischer to brussels to take either the post of eu foreign minister if the constitution calling for the position is passed by eu member countries .
barring that development , fischer would also have been a serious candidate for a post on the european commission in brussels , which will be replace its existing commissioners in 2004 .

according to a report in the british broadsheet the guardian , officials from the uk will tell their eu colleagues that any planning for european military operations must be carried out strictly under the auspices of the atlantic alliance . there have already been calls from paris , echoed by some voices within brussels , for the european union to co-ordinate and mount its own military operations through a " european military force . "
belgium and luxembourg are also in favor of the force and join germany and france in the so-called " gang of four " - the name given to the eu countries that opposed the u.s.-led invasion of iraq by pro-nato critics of the plan . eu force could anger the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato .
on the surface , britain agrees that the eu should be able to plan its own operations , but only from nato ’ s headquarters near mons in belgium .
however , british officials are warning their eu counterparts that the franco-german initiative will antagonize the united states and create unnecessary duplication between the eu and nato . many detractors see the idea of forming an eu force as an empty gesture after the divisions of the iraq crisis and some , britain in particular , are angry that it is still being pursued . ironically , the idea of eu defense was pioneered by britain and france after the end of the kosovo war in 1999 , a conflict which showed in glaring detail the huge gap between europe and the united states in terms of military might . current peacekeeping duties would increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since then , the eu has succeeded in creating new institutions and procedures and has deployed troops in peacekeeping missions in macedonia and congo .
plans to create a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force are also under way .
but anything larger will meet stiff resistance from british prime minister tony blair ’ s government . defense is one of the most controversial items in the eu 's draft constitution , which is due to be finalized in negotiations between all 15 member states starting in october .
if blair continues to oppose the formation of the force , he can count on the support of other nato loyalists such as the netherlands , poland , spain and denmark as well as neutral or non-aligned states .
with considerable disagreement about how to mould a common eu defense policy , the timing is far from optimal for planning such a force . compromise could make things worse any compromise is unlikely to break the deadlock completely .
sources quoted in the guardian report suggest that the french may agree on the british proposal for a " dedicated eu planning cell " without the military force to back it up but will give up any of their own ambitions to form an army to carry out the cell ’ s operations . the result could be an even worse situation where an eu “ trojan horse ” operates within nato while the eu expands and duplicates its own military structures outside it , some critics have warned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rapid reaction force ready by year 's end the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .

in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , walther recalled his ordeal . reto walther was one of 13 tourists freed by their captors in mali after nearly six months on august 19 .
since the group - including nine germans , four swiss and one dutch national - returned home , politicians in germany have discussed the possibility of requiring the hostages to help foot the bill for the efforts to release them . a total of 32 european vacationers were seized in separate incidents in february and march this year in southern algeria , where they were traveling .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may by killing their kidnappers , who belonged to the salafist group for preaching and combat islamist extremist group .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 . in an interview with deutsche welle , 31-year-old walther discussed his experience as a hostage . mr. walther , how are you faring after the long period in captivity ? i 'm quite surprised myself .
i 'm actually doing well .
i 'm healthy .
i 'm also happy to be home .
i 've still got an adrenaline high .
i 'm happy to be together with my wife and that keeps me full of energy . do you plan to seek professional help after this ordeal ?
you were part of the group that had to bury michaela spitzer in the middle of the night after she died of heatstroke , and you yourself held the eulogy .
how are you dealing with the trauma ? i actually feel relatively strong , perhaps too strong for some people .
but i 've also been persuaded to get professional help .
i 'm looking for the right place .
in any case , i will want to address this problem with professional help . mr. walther , on march 19 the kidnappers gave you a radio and you were able to follow the progress of efforts for your release .
did this umbilical cord - if you 'll permit the expression - help or did it intensify the feeling of powerlessness ?
you heard about search parties that may have been nearby , but you could n't contact them . that 's right .
of course , it was a very , very difficult situation for the whole group .
i can remember one evening where we heard that people were asking whether we had just got lost in the desert or whether we were the victims of a crime .
and i also remember that the mood was very , very low that evening .
then later , when the radio - deutsche welle - reported that search parties were en route , that people were looking for us from the air , the mood naturally improved and expectations increased as well . we were all very happy about the radio .
that 's how we heard about the war in iraq and then also about the other group that had been kidnapped that was later freed .
we heard that too .
we were happy for them , but we were disappointed that the other group was freed and not us . we only considered two radio broadcasters reliable , not just us hostages but also our kidnappers .
those were deutsche welle and i think a moroccan or french broadcaster that aired in french .
but we were always happy that we could receive deutsche welle at all because it broadcast really objective , good news .
hats off , really . did the kidnappers tell you why they took away the radio after three months ? they did n't give a reason .
the order came from the group 's highest leader .
i think it was due to reasons of security . there has been much speculation about the kidnappers motives .
they were split into two groups - the radicals and then there were those who slipped you food sometimes , who also apologized to you for the kidnapping .
to what extent did you see the kidnapping as being political - or was the main objective ransom money ? that 's a difficult question that i ca n't really answer .
my feeling says it is a politically motivated group that presumably just wanted money to buy something to be more mobile again with the help of this crime .
i think ultimately we were n't a political motive .
but that 's an assumption and not really well-founded . what will you do next ?
will you start to work again soon ?
will you travel to the sahara again ? i wo n't travel to the sahara for two reasons .
for one , it 's too unsafe there for me and secondly , my wife in pregnant .
i did n't know that for a long time during the kidnapping .
we are expecting our first child in november , and i will have an entirely new role as a father , which i 'm very happy about .
life will return to normal .
i will be able to work again next week , i hope .

sources quoted in the guardian report suggest that the french may agree on the british proposal for a " dedicated eu planning cell " without the military force to back it up but will give up any of their own ambitions to form an army to carry out the cell ’ s operations . the result could be an even worse situation where an eu “ trojan horse ” operates within nato while the eu expands and duplicates its own military structures outside it , some critics have warned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rapid reaction force ready by year 's end the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .

the german finance ministry admitted on friday deficit spending in berlin will exceed euro stability pact limits for a second year in a row .
if eu budgetary limits are breeched next year , brussels may impose sanctions . although the news was long expected , finance minister hans eichel officially confirmed friday that german public deficit spending would exceed the limit set forth in the maastricht treaty for the second year in a row .
but with an estimated budget deficit hitting 3.8 percent of gross domestic product for 2003 , berlin delivered a figure higher than previously expected . only as recently as july , the ministry was still forecasting maximum deficit spending of 3.5 percent – the same amount germany booked last year .
but as germany ’ s economy has stalled this year , the government has been required to borrow more . german finance minister hans eichel attributed the deficit prognosis to the " still restrained national economic developments that have created additional burdens for the labor market . "
the deficit has also been compounded by a decrease in tax revenues , which the government said were lower in summer than spring . in the run-up to the announcement , german chancellor gerhard schröder began a campaign in the media seeking to persuade brussels to interpret the maastricht rules more loosely .
though germany is home to the largest economy within the eu , it is also currently the weakest .
and schröder is seeking to find more wiggle room to help spark growth . " we don ’ t want to leave the stability pact , but we want to interpret it in an economically sensible way , " schröder told a group of foreign correspondents in berlin this week , according to the financial times newspaper .
the chancellor added that he believed his view is " shared by the french government and i haven ’ t seen italy taking a different position . " breaking the 3-percent limit under the maastricht treaty , eu members with the euro can not have budget deficits larger than 3 percent of gross domestic product in order to maintain the stability of the common currency .
if a euro zone country violates the treaty three years in a row , the european commission can impose sanctions ranging from taking greater control over national budget-making decisions to levying fines that can run as high as 0.5 percent of a country ’ s gross domestic product . during a trip to brussels earlier this week , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin said his country would continue to support the stability pact , but he called on the european commission to be more " flexible " about its interpretation .
earlier this week , the parisian financial newspaper les echos reported that the french finance ministry feared a deficit that could run as high as 3.9 percent this year . " europe will do its job , and the french government will do its job , " raffarin said at a joint press conference with european commission president romano prodi on wednesday .
" my primary responsibly is to do everything to increase growth and improve employment . " fair treatment but smaller eu countries are angered by attempts in berlin and paris to water-down the stability pact – led by countries like austria and the netherlands , which have worked hard to balance their budgets . schröder , meanwhile , called for " fair treatment " from the commission .
in the past , schröder and his foreign minister , joschka fischer , have both hinted that berlin has an understanding with brussels that penalties will not be imposed next year if the limits are breached , the financial times reported . and at the moment the commission is remaining optimistic it won ’ t have to .
on friday , a spokesman for the eu ’ s monetary affairs commissioner , pedro solbes , told reporters that as long as germany continued with its strict budgeting plans and economic and social system reforms that there was a " good possibility " the country ’ s deficit spending would fall below three percent again in 2004 and that economic growth that year could reach 2 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu warns of deficit action against france , germany if germany exceeds the 3 percent public spending deficit cap imposed by the pact ensuring the stability of the euro for a third consecutive year in 2004 , brussels may be forced to impose stiff fines or other punitive measures .

one of germany 's most promising new comedy talents is n't german at all - he 's american .
john doyle has been working to make germans laugh for eight years .
his efforts have paid off and he 's achieved national recognition . john doyle has been through more than a few trying times in his eight-year relationship with stand-up comedy .
he remembers his first solo show in cologne , where he had to perform for 90 minutes .
he got exactly two laughs . " and even then the audience was n't laughing at my jokes , but at my one-year-old son who 'd decided to take a stroll across the stage , " he told deutsche welle . then there was the time at a rock music festival when he followed a music act .
one minute into his routine and the beer bottles and curses started flying .
five minutes later , he literally ran for his life from the stage . " i almost needed therapy after that , " he said . how times change .
last month , doyle stood on stage at star search , a televised talent show of sorts , and performed to an audience of 3.1 million .
they loved him .
he moved steadily ahead in the competition , leaving his native-born competitors in the dust .
during the final , some 5.5 million tuned in . those flying beer bottles are but a distant memory , since today its contracts and acclaim that are hurtling his way .
while he did n't win the star search final , he did mightily impress germany 's comedy community . " that 's the best that i 've seen in a long time , " said hugo egon balder , one of germany 's leading comedy promoters and a star search jury members . now doyle has now been asked to be one of the headliners for blue monday , a show on german television which features up-and-coming talent .
two days later there 's a comedy festival and back to back gigs .
all of the sudden , the once struggling american comedian who almost begged for bookings at rotary club meetings is having to turn down offers . masochistic tendencies ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john doyle doyle admits doing comedy in germany , in german , is not the easiest job in the world , and not what he thought he would be doing when he came to germany twelve years ago for a language course .
he stayed , married a german and had a child .
still , some aspects of life here were hard to get used to . " germany is more serious than america in some ways , especially in daily life , " he said .
" i needed some levity , so i started to make jokes about life here , basically using comedy as a way of dealing with my reality . " as his command of the language improved , he decided to go public with his jokes , which often deal with being caught somewhere in the middle of germany and america .
he says he feels like something of an outsider to both cultures , a condition that might lead to low-level psychic trauma at times , but puts him in an ideal place to make droll observations about the absurdities in both societies . " i mean , if i see someone standing at a deserted street corner at 2:00 a.m. waiting for the light to change before he crosses the street , i 'm going to grab that , because an american would n't do that , " he said .
" a german probably would n't pick up on the humor in that picture . " not that different while the cliché of the humourless german might still be alive and kicking , doyle says it 's not that much harder to get germans to laugh than it is to get americans to bust a gut .
both audiences are demanding , he said , and want clever material that they can relate to in some way .
the trick , he said , is simple in theory and extremely difficult in practice : figuring out what they find funny . there are some differences though .
while topics around sex are often good for a laugh , german audiences wo n't go as far as their american counterparts .
doyle says there are still taboos in germany that have mostly faded in the u.s. and if a comedian ventures too far , accusations of being crude and hitting below the belt are quick to fly . on the other hand , since germans can have a more relaxed attitude towards sex over all than the average american , jokes that a u.s. audience would find risqué and therefore funny can fall flat in germany . " the response is sometimes like - so what ? "
doyle said . the funny american being known primarily as " that funny american guy " has been both good and bad for doyle 's comedy career .
his foreignness has given him more license to try out material that germans might not get away with .
he says because he 's not german , he is n't under the same constraints . " you 're not breaking rules , because the rules do n't apply to you , " he said .
" people just laugh and think , look at john , that weird american . " at the same time , there are downsides .
he lacks some of the common frames of reference that his german colleagues share with their audiences .
and since he is so strongly identified as an american , he is limited to stand-up gigs .
sketch comedy , popular on german television right now , is not an option for him .
he could n't just play a taxi driver or the henpecked husband because the audience would n't accept it . but he can live with that .
stand-up is his love and he 's hoping it 's going to take him to his own show one of these days .
right now he 's basking in the attention his star search success has brought him and relishing the hard-won recognition . " i always felt that there was something big inside me and it was disappointing since no one seemed to know it except for me and my wife , " doyle laughed .

the german finance ministry admitted on friday deficit spending in berlin will exceed euro stability pact limits for a second year in a row .
if eu budgetary limits are breeched next year , brussels may impose sanctions . although the news was long expected , finance minister hans eichel officially confirmed friday that german public deficit spending would exceed the limit set forth in the maastricht treaty for the second year in a row .
but with an estimated budget deficit hitting 3.8 percent of gross domestic product for 2003 , berlin delivered a figure higher than previously expected . only as recently as july , the ministry was still forecasting maximum deficit spending of 3.5 percent – the same amount germany booked last year .
but as germany ’ s economy has stalled this year , the government has been required to borrow more . german finance minister hans eichel attributed the deficit prognosis to the " still restrained national economic developments that have created additional burdens for the labor market . "
the deficit has also been compounded by a decrease in tax revenues , which the government said were lower in summer than spring . in the run-up to the announcement , german chancellor gerhard schröder began a campaign in the media seeking to persuade brussels to interpret the maastricht rules more loosely .
though germany is home to the largest economy within the eu , it is also currently the weakest .
and schröder is seeking to find more wiggle room to help spark growth . " we don ’ t want to leave the stability pact , but we want to interpret it in an economically sensible way , " schröder told a group of foreign correspondents in berlin this week , according to the financial times newspaper .
the chancellor added that he believed his view is " shared by the french government and i haven ’ t seen italy taking a different position . " breaking the 3-percent limit under the maastricht treaty , eu members with the euro can not have budget deficits larger than 3 percent of gross domestic product in order to maintain the stability of the common currency .
if a euro zone country violates the treaty three years in a row , the european commission can impose sanctions ranging from taking greater control over national budget-making decisions to levying fines that can run as high as 0.5 percent of a country ’ s gross domestic product . during a trip to brussels earlier this week , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin said his country would continue to support the stability pact , but he called on the european commission to be more " flexible " about its interpretation .
earlier this week , the parisian financial newspaper les echos reported that the french finance ministry feared a deficit that could run as high as 3.9 percent this year . " europe will do its job , and the french government will do its job , " raffarin said at a joint press conference with european commission president romano prodi on wednesday .
" my primary responsibly is to do everything to increase growth and improve employment . " fair treatment but smaller eu countries are angered by attempts in berlin and paris to water-down the stability pact – led by countries like austria and the netherlands , which have worked hard to balance their budgets . schröder , meanwhile , called for " fair treatment " from the commission .
in the past , schröder and his foreign minister , joschka fischer , have both hinted that berlin has an understanding with brussels that penalties will not be imposed next year if the limits are breached , the financial times reported . and at the moment the commission is remaining optimistic it won ’ t have to .
on friday , a spokesman for the eu ’ s monetary affairs commissioner , pedro solbes , told reporters that as long as germany continued with its strict budgeting plans and economic and social system reforms that there was a " good possibility " the country ’ s deficit spending would fall below three percent again in 2004 and that economic growth that year could reach 2 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu warns of deficit action against france , germany if germany exceeds the 3 percent public spending deficit cap imposed by the pact ensuring the stability of the euro for a third consecutive year in 2004 , brussels may be forced to impose stiff fines or other punitive measures .

in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , walther recalled his ordeal . reto walther was one of 13 tourists freed by their captors in mali after nearly six months on august 19 .
since the group - including nine germans , four swiss and one dutch national - returned home , politicians in germany have discussed the possibility of requiring the hostages to help foot the bill for the efforts to release them . a total of 32 european vacationers were seized in separate incidents in february and march this year in southern algeria , where they were traveling .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may by killing their kidnappers , who belonged to the salafist group for preaching and combat islamist extremist group .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 . in an interview with deutsche welle , 31-year-old walther discussed his experience as a hostage . mr. walther , how are you faring after the long period in captivity ? i 'm quite surprised myself .
i 'm actually doing well .
i 'm healthy .
i 'm also happy to be home .
i 've still got an adrenaline high .
i 'm happy to be together with my wife and that keeps me full of energy . do you plan to seek professional help after this ordeal ?
you were part of the group that had to bury michaela spitzer in the middle of the night after she died of heatstroke , and you yourself held the eulogy .
how are you dealing with the trauma ? i actually feel relatively strong , perhaps too strong for some people .
but i 've also been persuaded to get professional help .
i 'm looking for the right place .
in any case , i will want to address this problem with professional help . mr. walther , on march 19 the kidnappers gave you a radio and you were able to follow the progress of efforts for your release .
did this umbilical cord - if you 'll permit the expression - help or did it intensify the feeling of powerlessness ?
you heard about search parties that may have been nearby , but you could n't contact them . that 's right .
of course , it was a very , very difficult situation for the whole group .
i can remember one evening where we heard that people were asking whether we had just got lost in the desert or whether we were the victims of a crime .
and i also remember that the mood was very , very low that evening .
then later , when the radio - deutsche welle - reported that search parties were en route , that people were looking for us from the air , the mood naturally improved and expectations increased as well . we were all very happy about the radio .
that 's how we heard about the war in iraq and then also about the other group that had been kidnapped that was later freed .
we heard that too .
we were happy for them , but we were disappointed that the other group was freed and not us . we only considered two radio broadcasters reliable , not just us hostages but also our kidnappers .
those were deutsche welle and i think a moroccan or french broadcaster that aired in french .
but we were always happy that we could receive deutsche welle at all because it broadcast really objective , good news .
hats off , really . did the kidnappers tell you why they took away the radio after three months ? they did n't give a reason .
the order came from the group 's highest leader .
i think it was due to reasons of security . there has been much speculation about the kidnappers motives .
they were split into two groups - the radicals and then there were those who slipped you food sometimes , who also apologized to you for the kidnapping .
to what extent did you see the kidnapping as being political - or was the main objective ransom money ? that 's a difficult question that i ca n't really answer .
my feeling says it is a politically motivated group that presumably just wanted money to buy something to be more mobile again with the help of this crime .
i think ultimately we were n't a political motive .
but that 's an assumption and not really well-founded . what will you do next ?
will you start to work again soon ?
will you travel to the sahara again ? i wo n't travel to the sahara for two reasons .
for one , it 's too unsafe there for me and secondly , my wife in pregnant .
i did n't know that for a long time during the kidnapping .
we are expecting our first child in november , and i will have an entirely new role as a father , which i 'm very happy about .
life will return to normal .
i will be able to work again next week , i hope .

but with an estimated budget deficit hitting 3.8 percent of gross domestic product for 2003 , berlin delivered a figure higher than previously expected . only as recently as july , the ministry was still forecasting maximum deficit spending of 3.5 percent – the same amount germany booked last year .
but as germany ’ s economy has stalled this year , the government has been required to borrow more . german finance minister hans eichel attributed the deficit prognosis to the " still restrained national economic developments that have created additional burdens for the labor market . "
the deficit has also been compounded by a decrease in tax revenues , which the government said were lower in summer than spring . in the run-up to the announcement , german chancellor gerhard schröder began a campaign in the media seeking to persuade brussels to interpret the maastricht rules more loosely .
though germany is home to the largest economy within the eu , it is also currently the weakest .
and schröder is seeking to find more wiggle room to help spark growth . " we don ’ t want to leave the stability pact , but we want to interpret it in an economically sensible way , " schröder told a group of foreign correspondents in berlin this week , according to the financial times newspaper .
the chancellor added that he believed his view is " shared by the french government and i haven ’ t seen italy taking a different position . " breaking the 3-percent limit under the maastricht treaty , eu members with the euro can not have budget deficits larger than 3 percent of gross domestic product in order to maintain the stability of the common currency .
if a euro zone country violates the treaty three years in a row , the european commission can impose sanctions ranging from taking greater control over national budget-making decisions to levying fines that can run as high as 0.5 percent of a country ’ s gross domestic product . during a trip to brussels earlier this week , french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin said his country would continue to support the stability pact , but he called on the european commission to be more " flexible " about its interpretation .
earlier this week , the parisian financial newspaper les echos reported that the french finance ministry feared a deficit that could run as high as 3.9 percent this year . " europe will do its job , and the french government will do its job , " raffarin said at a joint press conference with european commission president romano prodi on wednesday .
" my primary responsibly is to do everything to increase growth and improve employment . " fair treatment but smaller eu countries are angered by attempts in berlin and paris to water-down the stability pact – led by countries like austria and the netherlands , which have worked hard to balance their budgets . schröder , meanwhile , called for " fair treatment " from the commission .
in the past , schröder and his foreign minister , joschka fischer , have both hinted that berlin has an understanding with brussels that penalties will not be imposed next year if the limits are breached , the financial times reported . and at the moment the commission is remaining optimistic it won ’ t have to .
on friday , a spokesman for the eu ’ s monetary affairs commissioner , pedro solbes , told reporters that as long as germany continued with its strict budgeting plans and economic and social system reforms that there was a " good possibility " the country ’ s deficit spending would fall below three percent again in 2004 and that economic growth that year could reach 2 percent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu warns of deficit action against france , germany if germany exceeds the 3 percent public spending deficit cap imposed by the pact ensuring the stability of the euro for a third consecutive year in 2004 , brussels may be forced to impose stiff fines or other punitive measures .

in an exclusive interview with deutsche welle , walther recalled his ordeal . reto walther was one of 13 tourists freed by their captors in mali after nearly six months on august 19 .
since the group - including nine germans , four swiss and one dutch national - returned home , politicians in germany have discussed the possibility of requiring the hostages to help foot the bill for the efforts to release them . a total of 32 european vacationers were seized in separate incidents in february and march this year in southern algeria , where they were traveling .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages in may by killing their kidnappers , who belonged to the salafist group for preaching and combat islamist extremist group .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 . in an interview with deutsche welle , 31-year-old walther discussed his experience as a hostage . mr. walther , how are you faring after the long period in captivity ? i 'm quite surprised myself .
i 'm actually doing well .
i 'm healthy .
i 'm also happy to be home .
i 've still got an adrenaline high .
i 'm happy to be together with my wife and that keeps me full of energy . do you plan to seek professional help after this ordeal ?
you were part of the group that had to bury michaela spitzer in the middle of the night after she died of heatstroke , and you yourself held the eulogy .
how are you dealing with the trauma ? i actually feel relatively strong , perhaps too strong for some people .
but i 've also been persuaded to get professional help .
i 'm looking for the right place .
in any case , i will want to address this problem with professional help . mr. walther , on march 19 the kidnappers gave you a radio and you were able to follow the progress of efforts for your release .
did this umbilical cord - if you 'll permit the expression - help or did it intensify the feeling of powerlessness ?
you heard about search parties that may have been nearby , but you could n't contact them . that 's right .
of course , it was a very , very difficult situation for the whole group .
i can remember one evening where we heard that people were asking whether we had just got lost in the desert or whether we were the victims of a crime .
and i also remember that the mood was very , very low that evening .
then later , when the radio - deutsche welle - reported that search parties were en route , that people were looking for us from the air , the mood naturally improved and expectations increased as well . we were all very happy about the radio .
that 's how we heard about the war in iraq and then also about the other group that had been kidnapped that was later freed .
we heard that too .
we were happy for them , but we were disappointed that the other group was freed and not us . we only considered two radio broadcasters reliable , not just us hostages but also our kidnappers .
those were deutsche welle and i think a moroccan or french broadcaster that aired in french .
but we were always happy that we could receive deutsche welle at all because it broadcast really objective , good news .
hats off , really . did the kidnappers tell you why they took away the radio after three months ? they did n't give a reason .
the order came from the group 's highest leader .
i think it was due to reasons of security . there has been much speculation about the kidnappers motives .
they were split into two groups - the radicals and then there were those who slipped you food sometimes , who also apologized to you for the kidnapping .
to what extent did you see the kidnapping as being political - or was the main objective ransom money ? that 's a difficult question that i ca n't really answer .
my feeling says it is a politically motivated group that presumably just wanted money to buy something to be more mobile again with the help of this crime .
i think ultimately we were n't a political motive .
but that 's an assumption and not really well-founded . what will you do next ?
will you start to work again soon ?
will you travel to the sahara again ? i wo n't travel to the sahara for two reasons .
for one , it 's too unsafe there for me and secondly , my wife in pregnant .
i did n't know that for a long time during the kidnapping .
we are expecting our first child in november , and i will have an entirely new role as a father , which i 'm very happy about .

but the figures contrasted sharply with evidence that much of japan 's economy remains in trouble , with unemployment still stubbornly high and household spending failing to show any signs of an upturn .
the industrial output gain , of 0.5 % in july , was put down to the apparent improvement in the us economy by observers .
production of electronic goods including mobile phones and digital cameras was sharply higher , and vendors such as sony are speaking of continuing their push for bigger market share in areas such as flat-screen tvs .
the gain in output reflects recent figures showing the economy has now expanded for six straight quarters , and a imf report leaked this week which boosted predictions of growth to above 1 % for 2003 .
troubles at home but the worry remains that domestic spending - japan 's achilles heel throughout the past decade of unerperformance - has yet to break out of the doldrums .
unemployment in july was stuck at 5.3 % , unchanged from the previous month and not far off the all-time high of 5.5 % .
and household spending sank 6 % over the year to july , reflecting worries about job security and undermining the chances of a domestic upturn .
retail sales figures accentuated the situation , showing a 3 % year-on-year fall and a 28th straight month of decline .
economists noted that an unusually cool and wet summer may have been largely to blame .

but the figures contrasted sharply with evidence that much of japan 's economy remains in trouble , with unemployment still stubbornly high and household spending failing to show any signs of an upturn .
the industrial output gain , of 0.5 % in july , was put down to the apparent improvement in the us economy by observers .
production of electronic goods including mobile phones and digital cameras was sharply higher , and vendors such as sony are speaking of continuing their push for bigger market share in areas such as flat-screen tvs .
the gain in output reflects recent figures showing the economy has now expanded for six straight quarters , and a imf report leaked this week which boosted predictions of growth to above 1 % for 2003 .
troubles at home but the worry remains that domestic spending - japan 's achilles heel throughout the past decade of unerperformance - has yet to break out of the doldrums .
unemployment in july was stuck at 5.3 % , unchanged from the previous month and not far off the all-time high of 5.5 % .
and household spending sank 6 % over the year to july , reflecting worries about job security and undermining the chances of a domestic upturn .
retail sales figures accentuated the situation , showing a 3 % year-on-year fall and a 28th straight month of decline .

the latest study by the marine conservation society and the uk 's wildlife trusts said research has shown the sharks have been spotted 37 times in british waters this year , compared with only one sighting last year .
the society says the species is recovering from the over-hunting which devastated the shark population during the 20th century .
the creature was hunted for its highly-valued gigantic dorsal fin , which is a delicacy in the far east .
the really great thing has been to see and record them in such numbers colin speedie the news comes as a cornwall-based boat gets ready to finish its nationwide survey of the 40-foot -lrb- 12 metre -rrb- seven-ton creatures , which it started in july .

its research has been aiming to identify sites of key importance and provide behavioural knowledge , vital in helping to safeguard the threatened species .
the survey , supported by the national express group and the heritage lottery fund , has also been boosted this year by the development of a database containing more than 255 new basking shark images that have shed new light on the lives of the creatures .
speaking on the survey and database , forever changes skipper colin speedie said : " the database has allowed us to identify individuals accurately for the first time .
" in one case , we found one basking shark that had been spotted off cornwall being next sighted off the coast of the west of ireland , which just shows how far they can and do roam .
" the really great thing about this year has of course been to see and record them in such numbers . "
the marine conservation society says such sightings show the basking shark population is starting to recover after being devastated by over-hunting and fishing during the last century .
but while hunting is now banned , the basking shark is still at risk from collisions with boats , entanglement in fishing nets and changes in sea temperatures due to climate change .
