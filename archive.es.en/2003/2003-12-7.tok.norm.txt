russians elect a new parliament on sunday .
polls show the united russia party will come out with a clear victory , but the real suspense is whether putin ’ s party can pull off a two-thirds majority . russians watching television on sunday could predict the outcome of the country ’ s first parliamentary election since president vladimir putin came into power just as clearly as any analyst .
all the state-run and even the semi-private stations are focusing on just one party - united russia .
although 23 parties are competing for seats in the duma , only the kremlin-backed party receives attention in the hourly news broadcasts .
both cannel one and rossia - the two main state-run stations - showed putin smiling and looking at ease while announcing that most russians knew which party he endorsed , namely united russia whose events he attended with public fanfare .
" my preferences are well know , " putin told reporters after he cast his ballot .

clear victory for putin going into the election , opinion polls put united russia in the lead with 30-40 percent of the votes , well ahead of the opposition communists and the small liberal yabloko and the union of right forces .
running on a platform based largely on lending support to putin , who has an approval rating of more than 80 percent , the party is assured of victory .
the only real question that remains ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its conservative allies can secure more than 300 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes , such as enabling the president to run again after the end of his likely second term in 2008 .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation told dw-radio .
putin is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , it has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president . "
pre-defined results in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said pedrov .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians are critical of the dominance of the putin-backed party in the media .
in yekaterinburg , on the border between europe and asia , voters said they saw no alternative to united russia .
" nothing will change , everything was decided beforehand , " a russian lamented to western reporters before casting his ballot .

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .
the snap poll conducted by the institute of comparative social studies published the first results after the last polls closed at 1800 gmt .
although final results are not expected until monday , observers are banking on a pro-government majority in the duma as the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party -lrb- ldpr -rrb- and motherland , a newly-formed leftist-nationalist party , show early counts of about 12 and 9 percent respectively .
both parties are close to the kremlin and together with united russia could hand putin a voting bloc of 58 percent in the parliament .

exit polls gave both parties about 6 percent .

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .

although final results are not expected until monday , observers are banking on a pro-government majority in the duma as the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party -lrb- ldpr -rrb- and motherland , a newly-formed leftist-nationalist party , show early counts of about 12 and 9 percent respectively .
both parties are close to the kremlin and together with united russia could hand putin a voting bloc of 58 percent in the parliament .
liberal opposition passes hurdle despite the overwhelming attention given to united russia in the country ’ s media , two small liberal parties managed to make it to the duma .
the pro-democracy parties , yabloko and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- overcame the crucial five-percent hurdle to gain a share of the proportionally allocated seats in the 450-member parliament .
exit polls gave both parties about 6 percent .
the final makeup of the duma , the lower house of parliament , could differ significantly from the early results , since only 225 seats are elected through nationwide proportional representation .

two-thirds majority still uncertain the main question circling ahead of the final results is whether or not united russia and its pro-kremlin allies will receive a two-thirds majority , or more than 300 seats .
if that happens , it would allow putin to push through changes to the constitution including enabling him to remain in power beyond his likely second term in 2008 .

polls show the united russia party will come out with a clear victory , but the real suspense is whether putin ’ s party can pull off a two-thirds majority . russians watching television on sunday could predict the outcome of the country ’ s first parliamentary election since president vladimir putin came into power just as clearly as any analyst .
all the state-run and even the semi-private stations are focusing on just one party - united russia .
although 23 parties are competing for seats in the duma , only the kremlin-backed party receives attention in the hourly news broadcasts .
both cannel one and rossia - the two main state-run stations - showed putin smiling and looking at ease while announcing that most russians knew which party he endorsed , namely united russia whose events he attended with public fanfare .
" my preferences are well know , " putin told reporters after he cast his ballot .

7 , 2003 .
clear victory for putin going into the election , opinion polls put united russia in the lead with 30-40 percent of the votes , well ahead of the opposition communists and the small liberal yabloko and the union of right forces .
running on a platform based largely on lending support to putin , who has an approval rating of more than 80 percent , the party is assured of victory .
the only real question that remains ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its conservative allies can secure more than 300 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes , such as enabling the president to run again after the end of his likely second term in 2008 .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation told dw-radio .
putin is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , it has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president . "
pre-defined results in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said pedrov .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians are critical of the dominance of the putin-backed party in the media .
in yekaterinburg , on the border between europe and asia , voters said they saw no alternative to united russia .
" nothing will change , everything was decided beforehand , " a russian lamented to western reporters before casting his ballot .
" it was united russia and it will stay that way .

russians elect a new parliament on sunday .
polls show the united russia party will come out with a clear victory , but the real suspense is whether putin ’ s party can pull off a two-thirds majority . russians watching television on sunday could predict the outcome of the country ’ s first parliamentary election since president vladimir putin came into power just as clearly as any analyst .
all the state-run and even the semi-private stations are focusing on just one party - united russia .
although 23 parties are competing for seats in the duma , only the kremlin-backed party receives attention in the hourly news broadcasts .
both cannel one and rossia - the two main state-run stations - showed putin smiling and looking at ease while announcing that most russians knew which party he endorsed , namely united russia whose events he attended with public fanfare .

clear victory for putin going into the election , opinion polls put united russia in the lead with 30-40 percent of the votes , well ahead of the opposition communists and the small liberal yabloko and the union of right forces .
running on a platform based largely on lending support to putin , who has an approval rating of more than 80 percent , the party is assured of victory .
the only real question that remains ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its conservative allies can secure more than 300 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes , such as enabling the president to run again after the end of his likely second term in 2008 .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation told dw-radio .
putin is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , it has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president . "
pre-defined results in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said pedrov .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .
the snap poll conducted by the institute of comparative social studies published the first results after the last polls closed at 1800 gmt .
although final results are not expected until monday , observers are banking on a pro-government majority in the duma as the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party -lrb- ldpr -rrb- and motherland , a newly-formed leftist-nationalist party , show early counts of about 12 and 9 percent respectively .
both parties are close to the kremlin and together with united russia could hand putin a voting bloc of 58 percent in the parliament .

exit polls gave both parties about 6 percent .

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .

russians elect a new parliament on sunday .
polls show the united russia party will come out with a clear victory , but the real suspense is whether putin ’ s party can pull off a two-thirds majority . russians watching television on sunday could predict the outcome of the country ’ s first parliamentary election since president vladimir putin came into power just as clearly as any analyst .
all the state-run and even the semi-private stations are focusing on just one party - united russia .
although 23 parties are competing for seats in the duma , only the kremlin-backed party receives attention in the hourly news broadcasts .
both cannel one and rossia - the two main state-run stations - showed putin smiling and looking at ease while announcing that most russians knew which party he endorsed , namely united russia whose events he attended with public fanfare .
" my preferences are well know , " putin told reporters after he cast his ballot .

clear victory for putin going into the election , opinion polls put united russia in the lead with 30-40 percent of the votes , well ahead of the opposition communists and the small liberal yabloko and the union of right forces .
running on a platform based largely on lending support to putin , who has an approval rating of more than 80 percent , the party is assured of victory .
the only real question that remains ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its conservative allies can secure more than 300 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes , such as enabling the president to run again after the end of his likely second term in 2008 .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation told dw-radio .
putin is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , it has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president . "
pre-defined results in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said pedrov .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians are critical of the dominance of the putin-backed party in the media .
in yekaterinburg , on the border between europe and asia , voters said they saw no alternative to united russia .
" nothing will change , everything was decided beforehand , " a russian lamented to western reporters before casting his ballot .

all the state-run and even the semi-private stations are focusing on just one party - united russia .
although 23 parties are competing for seats in the duma , only the kremlin-backed party receives attention in the hourly news broadcasts .
both cannel one and rossia - the two main state-run stations - showed putin smiling and looking at ease while announcing that most russians knew which party he endorsed , namely united russia whose events he attended with public fanfare .

clear victory for putin going into the election , opinion polls put united russia in the lead with 30-40 percent of the votes , well ahead of the opposition communists and the small liberal yabloko and the union of right forces .
running on a platform based largely on lending support to putin , who has an approval rating of more than 80 percent , the party is assured of victory .
the only real question that remains ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its conservative allies can secure more than 300 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes , such as enabling the president to run again after the end of his likely second term in 2008 .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation told dw-radio .
putin is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , it has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president . "
pre-defined results in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said pedrov .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians are critical of the dominance of the putin-backed party in the media .
in yekaterinburg , on the border between europe and asia , voters said they saw no alternative to united russia .

russians elect a new parliament on sunday .
polls show the united russia party will come out with a clear victory , but the real suspense is whether putin ’ s party can pull off a two-thirds majority . russians watching television on sunday could predict the outcome of the country ’ s first parliamentary election since president vladimir putin came into power just as clearly as any analyst .
all the state-run and even the semi-private stations are focusing on just one party - united russia .
although 23 parties are competing for seats in the duma , only the kremlin-backed party receives attention in the hourly news broadcasts .
both cannel one and rossia - the two main state-run stations - showed putin smiling and looking at ease while announcing that most russians knew which party he endorsed , namely united russia whose events he attended with public fanfare .
" my preferences are well know , " putin told reporters after he cast his ballot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin and his wife lyudmila walk to a polling station during the parliamentary elections in moscow , sunday , dec .
7 , 2003 .
clear victory for putin going into the election , opinion polls put united russia in the lead with 30-40 percent of the votes , well ahead of the opposition communists and the small liberal yabloko and the union of right forces .
running on a platform based largely on lending support to putin , who has an approval rating of more than 80 percent , the party is assured of victory .
the only real question that remains ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its conservative allies can secure more than 300 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes , such as enabling the president to run again after the end of his likely second term in 2008 .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation told dw-radio .
putin is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , it has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president . "
pre-defined results in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said pedrov .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians are critical of the dominance of the putin-backed party in the media .
in yekaterinburg , on the border between europe and asia , voters said they saw no alternative to united russia .
" nothing will change , everything was decided beforehand , " a russian lamented to western reporters before casting his ballot .
" it was united russia and it will stay that way .
of course i still hope things will change , but i ’ m not expecting anything out of the ordinary , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de train bombing overshadows russian election two days after a deadly suicide bombing , russians elect a new parliament .

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .
the snap poll conducted by the institute of comparative social studies published the first results after the last polls closed at 1800 gmt .
although final results are not expected until monday , observers are banking on a pro-government majority in the duma as the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party -lrb- ldpr -rrb- and motherland , a newly-formed leftist-nationalist party , show early counts of about 12 and 9 percent respectively .
both parties are close to the kremlin and together with united russia could hand putin a voting bloc of 58 percent in the parliament .
liberal opposition passes hurdle despite the overwhelming attention given to united russia in the country ’ s media , two small liberal parties managed to make it to the duma .
the pro-democracy parties , yabloko and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- overcame the crucial five-percent hurdle to gain a share of the proportionally allocated seats in the 450-member parliament .
exit polls gave both parties about 6 percent .
the final makeup of the duma , the lower house of parliament , could differ significantly from the early results , since only 225 seats are elected through nationwide proportional representation .
the other half of parliament is elected in individual constituencies through direct mandates .
two-thirds majority still uncertain the main question circling ahead of the final results is whether or not united russia and its pro-kremlin allies will receive a two-thirds majority , or more than 300 seats .
if that happens , it would allow putin to push through changes to the constitution including enabling him to remain in power beyond his likely second term in 2008 .
observers say this is putin ’ s goal and he has made no secret out of his preference for united russia .
on the contrary , he has lent the party his face for campaign slogans saying " together with the president . "
with putin ’ s approval rating soaring at over 80 percent , the party is sure to come out a winner . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kremlin-backed party aims for two-thirds majority russians elect a new parliament on sunday .
polls show the united russia party will come out with a clear victory , but the real suspense is whether putin ’ s party can pull off a two-thirds majority .
train bombing overshadows russian election a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region .

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .
the snap poll conducted by the institute of comparative social studies published the first results after the last polls closed at 1800 gmt .
although final results are not expected until monday , observers are banking on a pro-government majority in the duma as the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party -lrb- ldpr -rrb- and motherland , a newly-formed leftist-nationalist party , show early counts of about 12 and 9 percent respectively .
both parties are close to the kremlin and together with united russia could hand putin a voting bloc of 58 percent in the parliament .
liberal opposition passes hurdle despite the overwhelming attention given to united russia in the country ’ s media , two small liberal parties managed to make it to the duma .
the pro-democracy parties , yabloko and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- overcame the crucial five-percent hurdle to gain a share of the proportionally allocated seats in the 450-member parliament .
exit polls gave both parties about 6 percent .
the final makeup of the duma , the lower house of parliament , could differ significantly from the early results , since only 225 seats are elected through nationwide proportional representation .
the other half of parliament is elected in individual constituencies through direct mandates .
two-thirds majority still uncertain the main question circling ahead of the final results is whether or not united russia and its pro-kremlin allies will receive a two-thirds majority , or more than 300 seats .
if that happens , it would allow putin to push through changes to the constitution including enabling him to remain in power beyond his likely second term in 2008 .
observers say this is putin ’ s goal and he has made no secret out of his preference for united russia .
on the contrary , he has lent the party his face for campaign slogans saying " together with the president . "
with putin ’ s approval rating soaring at over 80 percent , the party is sure to come out a winner . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kremlin-backed party aims for two-thirds majority russians elect a new parliament on sunday .
polls show the united russia party will come out with a clear victory , but the real suspense is whether putin ’ s party can pull off a two-thirds majority .
train bombing overshadows russian election a day after an attack on a commuter train killed at least 42 people , russia is still reeling from the shock .
world leaders have condemned the bombing as an act of terrorism designed to destabilize the region .

clear victory for putin going into the election , opinion polls put united russia in the lead with 30-40 percent of the votes , well ahead of the opposition communists and the small liberal yabloko and the union of right forces .
running on a platform based largely on lending support to putin , who has an approval rating of more than 80 percent , the party is assured of victory .
the only real question that remains ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its conservative allies can secure more than 300 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes , such as enabling the president to run again after the end of his likely second term in 2008 .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation told dw-radio .
putin is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , it has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president . "
pre-defined results in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said pedrov .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .

russians elect a new parliament on sunday .
polls show the united russia party will come out with a clear victory , but the real suspense is whether putin ’ s party can pull off a two-thirds majority . russians watching television on sunday could predict the outcome of the country ’ s first parliamentary election since president vladimir putin came into power just as clearly as any analyst .
all the state-run and even the semi-private stations are focusing on just one party - united russia .
although 23 parties are competing for seats in the duma , only the kremlin-backed party receives attention in the hourly news broadcasts .
both cannel one and rossia - the two main state-run stations - showed putin smiling and looking at ease while announcing that most russians knew which party he endorsed , namely united russia whose events he attended with public fanfare .

clear victory for putin going into the election , opinion polls put united russia in the lead with 30-40 percent of the votes , well ahead of the opposition communists and the small liberal yabloko and the union of right forces .
running on a platform based largely on lending support to putin , who has an approval rating of more than 80 percent , the party is assured of victory .
the only real question that remains ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its conservative allies can secure more than 300 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes , such as enabling the president to run again after the end of his likely second term in 2008 .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation told dw-radio .
putin is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , it has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president . "
pre-defined results in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said pedrov .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .
the snap poll conducted by the institute of comparative social studies published the first results after the last polls closed at 1800 gmt .
although final results are not expected until monday , observers are banking on a pro-government majority in the duma as the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party -lrb- ldpr -rrb- and motherland , a newly-formed leftist-nationalist party , show early counts of about 12 and 9 percent respectively .
both parties are close to the kremlin and together with united russia could hand putin a voting bloc of 58 percent in the parliament .
liberal opposition passes hurdle despite the overwhelming attention given to united russia in the country ’ s media , two small liberal parties managed to make it to the duma .
the pro-democracy parties , yabloko and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- overcame the crucial five-percent hurdle to gain a share of the proportionally allocated seats in the 450-member parliament .
exit polls gave both parties about 6 percent .
the final makeup of the duma , the lower house of parliament , could differ significantly from the early results , since only 225 seats are elected through nationwide proportional representation .
the other half of parliament is elected in individual constituencies through direct mandates .
two-thirds majority still uncertain the main question circling ahead of the final results is whether or not united russia and its pro-kremlin allies will receive a two-thirds majority , or more than 300 seats .
if that happens , it would allow putin to push through changes to the constitution including enabling him to remain in power beyond his likely second term in 2008 .
observers say this is putin ’ s goal and he has made no secret out of his preference for united russia .

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .
the snap poll conducted by the institute of comparative social studies published the first results after the last polls closed at 1800 gmt .
although final results are not expected until monday , observers are banking on a pro-government majority in the duma as the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party -lrb- ldpr -rrb- and motherland , a newly-formed leftist-nationalist party , show early counts of about 12 and 9 percent respectively .
both parties are close to the kremlin and together with united russia could hand putin a voting bloc of 58 percent in the parliament .
liberal opposition passes hurdle despite the overwhelming attention given to united russia in the country ’ s media , two small liberal parties managed to make it to the duma .
the pro-democracy parties , yabloko and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- overcame the crucial five-percent hurdle to gain a share of the proportionally allocated seats in the 450-member parliament .
exit polls gave both parties about 6 percent .
the final makeup of the duma , the lower house of parliament , could differ significantly from the early results , since only 225 seats are elected through nationwide proportional representation .
the other half of parliament is elected in individual constituencies through direct mandates .
two-thirds majority still uncertain the main question circling ahead of the final results is whether or not united russia and its pro-kremlin allies will receive a two-thirds majority , or more than 300 seats .
if that happens , it would allow putin to push through changes to the constitution including enabling him to remain in power beyond his likely second term in 2008 .
observers say this is putin ’ s goal and he has made no secret out of his preference for united russia .
on the contrary , he has lent the party his face for campaign slogans saying " together with the president . "

russians elect a new parliament on sunday .
polls show the united russia party will come out with a clear victory , but the real suspense is whether putin ’ s party can pull off a two-thirds majority . russians watching television on sunday could predict the outcome of the country ’ s first parliamentary election since president vladimir putin came into power just as clearly as any analyst .
all the state-run and even the semi-private stations are focusing on just one party - united russia .
although 23 parties are competing for seats in the duma , only the kremlin-backed party receives attention in the hourly news broadcasts .
both cannel one and rossia - the two main state-run stations - showed putin smiling and looking at ease while announcing that most russians knew which party he endorsed , namely united russia whose events he attended with public fanfare .
" my preferences are well know , " putin told reporters after he cast his ballot .

clear victory for putin going into the election , opinion polls put united russia in the lead with 30-40 percent of the votes , well ahead of the opposition communists and the small liberal yabloko and the union of right forces .
running on a platform based largely on lending support to putin , who has an approval rating of more than 80 percent , the party is assured of victory .
the only real question that remains ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its conservative allies can secure more than 300 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes , such as enabling the president to run again after the end of his likely second term in 2008 .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation told dw-radio .
putin is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , it has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president . "
pre-defined results in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said pedrov .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians are critical of the dominance of the putin-backed party in the media .
in yekaterinburg , on the border between europe and asia , voters said they saw no alternative to united russia .
" nothing will change , everything was decided beforehand , " a russian lamented to western reporters before casting his ballot .

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .
the snap poll conducted by the institute of comparative social studies published the first results after the last polls closed at 1800 gmt .
although final results are not expected until monday , observers are banking on a pro-government majority in the duma as the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party -lrb- ldpr -rrb- and motherland , a newly-formed leftist-nationalist party , show early counts of about 12 and 9 percent respectively .
both parties are close to the kremlin and together with united russia could hand putin a voting bloc of 58 percent in the parliament .

exit polls gave both parties about 6 percent .

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .

polls show the united russia party will come out with a clear victory , but the real suspense is whether putin ’ s party can pull off a two-thirds majority . russians watching television on sunday could predict the outcome of the country ’ s first parliamentary election since president vladimir putin came into power just as clearly as any analyst .
all the state-run and even the semi-private stations are focusing on just one party - united russia .
although 23 parties are competing for seats in the duma , only the kremlin-backed party receives attention in the hourly news broadcasts .
both cannel one and rossia - the two main state-run stations - showed putin smiling and looking at ease while announcing that most russians knew which party he endorsed , namely united russia whose events he attended with public fanfare .

clear victory for putin going into the election , opinion polls put united russia in the lead with 30-40 percent of the votes , well ahead of the opposition communists and the small liberal yabloko and the union of right forces .
running on a platform based largely on lending support to putin , who has an approval rating of more than 80 percent , the party is assured of victory .
the only real question that remains ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its conservative allies can secure more than 300 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes , such as enabling the president to run again after the end of his likely second term in 2008 .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation told dw-radio .
putin is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , it has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president . "
pre-defined results in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said pedrov .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians are critical of the dominance of the putin-backed party in the media .
in yekaterinburg , on the border between europe and asia , voters said they saw no alternative to united russia .

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .
the snap poll conducted by the institute of comparative social studies published the first results after the last polls closed at 1800 gmt .
although final results are not expected until monday , observers are banking on a pro-government majority in the duma as the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party -lrb- ldpr -rrb- and motherland , a newly-formed leftist-nationalist party , show early counts of about 12 and 9 percent respectively .
both parties are close to the kremlin and together with united russia could hand putin a voting bloc of 58 percent in the parliament .
liberal opposition passes hurdle despite the overwhelming attention given to united russia in the country ’ s media , two small liberal parties managed to make it to the duma .
the pro-democracy parties , yabloko and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- overcame the crucial five-percent hurdle to gain a share of the proportionally allocated seats in the 450-member parliament .
exit polls gave both parties about 6 percent .
the final makeup of the duma , the lower house of parliament , could differ significantly from the early results , since only 225 seats are elected through nationwide proportional representation .
the other half of parliament is elected in individual constituencies through direct mandates .
two-thirds majority still uncertain the main question circling ahead of the final results is whether or not united russia and its pro-kremlin allies will receive a two-thirds majority , or more than 300 seats .
if that happens , it would allow putin to push through changes to the constitution including enabling him to remain in power beyond his likely second term in 2008 .
observers say this is putin ’ s goal and he has made no secret out of his preference for united russia .
on the contrary , he has lent the party his face for campaign slogans saying " together with the president . "

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .
the snap poll conducted by the institute of comparative social studies published the first results after the last polls closed at 1800 gmt .
although final results are not expected until monday , observers are banking on a pro-government majority in the duma as the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party -lrb- ldpr -rrb- and motherland , a newly-formed leftist-nationalist party , show early counts of about 12 and 9 percent respectively .
both parties are close to the kremlin and together with united russia could hand putin a voting bloc of 58 percent in the parliament .
liberal opposition passes hurdle despite the overwhelming attention given to united russia in the country ’ s media , two small liberal parties managed to make it to the duma .
the pro-democracy parties , yabloko and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- overcame the crucial five-percent hurdle to gain a share of the proportionally allocated seats in the 450-member parliament .
exit polls gave both parties about 6 percent .
the final makeup of the duma , the lower house of parliament , could differ significantly from the early results , since only 225 seats are elected through nationwide proportional representation .
the other half of parliament is elected in individual constituencies through direct mandates .
two-thirds majority still uncertain the main question circling ahead of the final results is whether or not united russia and its pro-kremlin allies will receive a two-thirds majority , or more than 300 seats .
if that happens , it would allow putin to push through changes to the constitution including enabling him to remain in power beyond his likely second term in 2008 .
observers say this is putin ’ s goal and he has made no secret out of his preference for united russia .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he was " 55 percent optimistic " european leaders would agree on the eu draft constitution this week . speaking to reporters in berlin after a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder , berlusconi said on sunday that the upcoming european union summit on the first ever constitution has a slightly better chance of success than failure .
the intergovernmental conference , which takes place on friday in brussels , has been pitched as a " do-or-die " meeting as time runs out for european leaders to find a compromise on the draft constitution before the historic expansion of the bloc to include 10 new countries in 2004 .
berlusconi ’ s statements in berlin were only slightly more optimistic than his prognosis on saturday , in which he said there was a 50-50 chance of an agreement .
the italian leader , who has been keen to see the constitution finalized before he hands over the helm to ireland at the start of the year , warned that it would be a " grave mistake to seek to wrap up -lrb- the summit -rrb- at any cost . "
final countdown on monday eu foreign ministers hold a final negotiating session in an attempt to further narrow differences before friday ’ s summit starts .
the dispute over voting powers in eu decision-making remains the main stumbling block with spain and incoming member poland fighting to hold onto weighted voting as agreed to in the nice treaty in 2000 .
germany and france , backed by a majority of present and future member states , are pressing for a reform of the voting system to take greater account of population size .
the current disproportionate voting powers awarded at the eu summit two years ago gave spain and poland 27 votes each compared to 29 for the largest states including germany , which has more than twice their population .

on sunday , schröder told berlusconi he had no intention of budging on his country ’ s opposition to spain and poland ’ s position .
voting obstacle the issue of voting powers is such an acrimonious one that it threatens to derail the entire constitution process .
drawn up by a convention of national representatives headed by former french president valery giscard d ’ etaing , the draft constitution proposes a " double majority " voting system in which most decisions would pass if backed by a simple majority of states representing 60 percent of the population .
but spain and poland , population-wise considerably smaller than the three big eu power-players , germany , france and britain , are under enormous pressure at home to fight for weighted voting which would give them a bigger say in eu affairs .
eu diplomats have said there is little chance of a shift to a reformed voting system of the kind called for in the constitution .
the remaining bargaining chips in the draft - the number of seats on the european commission and in the european parliament - are considered insufficient to persuade spanish prime minister jose maria aznar and polish prime minister leszek miller to back down from their demands .
berlusconi , whose job it is to find a compromise , has called the spanish-polish voting power an " anomaly , " which needs to be reformed .
but the italian leader , who has openly hoped to end his much-criticized six-month presidency on a positive note , said he was prepared to hand over the problem to his successor ireland rather than accept a watered-down constitution .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he was " 55 percent optimistic " european leaders would agree on the eu draft constitution this week . speaking to reporters in berlin after a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder , berlusconi said on sunday that the upcoming european union summit on the first ever constitution has a slightly better chance of success than failure .
the intergovernmental conference , which takes place on friday in brussels , has been pitched as a " do-or-die " meeting as time runs out for european leaders to find a compromise on the draft constitution before the historic expansion of the bloc to include 10 new countries in 2004 .
berlusconi ’ s statements in berlin were only slightly more optimistic than his prognosis on saturday , in which he said there was a 50-50 chance of an agreement .
the italian leader , who has been keen to see the constitution finalized before he hands over the helm to ireland at the start of the year , warned that it would be a " grave mistake to seek to wrap up -lrb- the summit -rrb- at any cost . "

the dispute over voting powers in eu decision-making remains the main stumbling block with spain and incoming member poland fighting to hold onto weighted voting as agreed to in the nice treaty in 2000 .
germany and france , backed by a majority of present and future member states , are pressing for a reform of the voting system to take greater account of population size .
the current disproportionate voting powers awarded at the eu summit two years ago gave spain and poland 27 votes each compared to 29 for the largest states including germany , which has more than twice their population .

on sunday , schröder told berlusconi he had no intention of budging on his country ’ s opposition to spain and poland ’ s position .
voting obstacle the issue of voting powers is such an acrimonious one that it threatens to derail the entire constitution process .
drawn up by a convention of national representatives headed by former french president valery giscard d ’ etaing , the draft constitution proposes a " double majority " voting system in which most decisions would pass if backed by a simple majority of states representing 60 percent of the population .
but spain and poland , population-wise considerably smaller than the three big eu power-players , germany , france and britain , are under enormous pressure at home to fight for weighted voting which would give them a bigger say in eu affairs .
eu diplomats have said there is little chance of a shift to a reformed voting system of the kind called for in the constitution .
the remaining bargaining chips in the draft - the number of seats on the european commission and in the european parliament - are considered insufficient to persuade spanish prime minister jose maria aznar and polish prime minister leszek miller to back down from their demands .
berlusconi , whose job it is to find a compromise , has called the spanish-polish voting power an " anomaly , " which needs to be reformed .
but the italian leader , who has openly hoped to end his much-criticized six-month presidency on a positive note , said he was prepared to hand over the problem to his successor ireland rather than accept a watered-down constitution .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , said he was " 55 percent optimistic " european leaders would agree on the eu draft constitution this week . speaking to reporters in berlin after a meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder , berlusconi said on sunday that the upcoming european union summit on the first ever constitution has a slightly better chance of success than failure .
the intergovernmental conference , which takes place on friday in brussels , has been pitched as a " do-or-die " meeting as time runs out for european leaders to find a compromise on the draft constitution before the historic expansion of the bloc to include 10 new countries in 2004 .
berlusconi ’ s statements in berlin were only slightly more optimistic than his prognosis on saturday , in which he said there was a 50-50 chance of an agreement .
the italian leader , who has been keen to see the constitution finalized before he hands over the helm to ireland at the start of the year , warned that it would be a " grave mistake to seek to wrap up -lrb- the summit -rrb- at any cost . "
final countdown on monday eu foreign ministers hold a final negotiating session in an attempt to further narrow differences before friday ’ s summit starts .
the dispute over voting powers in eu decision-making remains the main stumbling block with spain and incoming member poland fighting to hold onto weighted voting as agreed to in the nice treaty in 2000 .
germany and france , backed by a majority of present and future member states , are pressing for a reform of the voting system to take greater account of population size .
the current disproportionate voting powers awarded at the eu summit two years ago gave spain and poland 27 votes each compared to 29 for the largest states including germany , which has more than twice their population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and aznar agree to disagree on voting powers - here at a press conference in berlin on nov .
4 , 2003 .
on sunday , schröder told berlusconi he had no intention of budging on his country ’ s opposition to spain and poland ’ s position .
voting obstacle the issue of voting powers is such an acrimonious one that it threatens to derail the entire constitution process .
drawn up by a convention of national representatives headed by former french president valery giscard d ’ etaing , the draft constitution proposes a " double majority " voting system in which most decisions would pass if backed by a simple majority of states representing 60 percent of the population .
but spain and poland , population-wise considerably smaller than the three big eu power-players , germany , france and britain , are under enormous pressure at home to fight for weighted voting which would give them a bigger say in eu affairs .
eu diplomats have said there is little chance of a shift to a reformed voting system of the kind called for in the constitution .
the remaining bargaining chips in the draft - the number of seats on the european commission and in the european parliament - are considered insufficient to persuade spanish prime minister jose maria aznar and polish prime minister leszek miller to back down from their demands .
berlusconi , whose job it is to find a compromise , has called the spanish-polish voting power an " anomaly , " which needs to be reformed .
but the italian leader , who has openly hoped to end his much-criticized six-month presidency on a positive note , said he was prepared to hand over the problem to his successor ireland rather than accept a watered-down constitution .
giscard , too , has said it would be better to have no constitution than a mutilated one .
an ineffective charter could lead to " the gradual falling apart of the european union , " he warned . -lrb- written based on wire reports -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : no consensus on the horizon at a two-day meeting in naples , the foreign ministers of the future 25 member states of the european union discussed contentious points of the draft eu constitution .

russians elect a new parliament on sunday .
polls show the united russia party will come out with a clear victory , but the real suspense is whether putin ’ s party can pull off a two-thirds majority . russians watching television on sunday could predict the outcome of the country ’ s first parliamentary election since president vladimir putin came into power just as clearly as any analyst .
all the state-run and even the semi-private stations are focusing on just one party - united russia .
although 23 parties are competing for seats in the duma , only the kremlin-backed party receives attention in the hourly news broadcasts .
both cannel one and rossia - the two main state-run stations - showed putin smiling and looking at ease while announcing that most russians knew which party he endorsed , namely united russia whose events he attended with public fanfare .
" my preferences are well know , " putin told reporters after he cast his ballot .

clear victory for putin going into the election , opinion polls put united russia in the lead with 30-40 percent of the votes , well ahead of the opposition communists and the small liberal yabloko and the union of right forces .
running on a platform based largely on lending support to putin , who has an approval rating of more than 80 percent , the party is assured of victory .
the only real question that remains ahead of tallying the final results is whether united russia , an alliance of pro-kremlin factions headed by putin ’ s ally , interior minister boris gryzlov , will manage to get a two-thirds majority in the 450-seat parliament .
if united russia and its conservative allies can secure more than 300 seats in the duma , it would comprise a majority and essentially allow putin to institute constitutional changes , such as enabling the president to run again after the end of his likely second term in 2008 .
" the goal is to get as close as possible to a constitutional majority , " nikolai pedrov , a political analyst at the moscow-based carnegie foundation told dw-radio .
putin is set for re-election in march and has thrown his full weight behind united russia .
lending the party his face for ads , it has campaigned with the slogan : " together with the president . "
pre-defined results in the run-up to the elections , voter interest in the parties and their issues has been relatively low .
this is largely due to the publishing of " pre-defined results " ahead of the elections , said pedrov .
people already know ahead of time who the winner is , so there is no reason for them to go out and vote .
critics also suggest that the expected low voter turnout may be a consequence of the kremlin ’ s overbearing influence on the elections , where united russia uses state control of television to dominate the media and essentially silence the opposition .
the organization for security and cooperation in europe , which is monitoring the elections , has said that pre-election campaigning was marred by pro-kremlin bias in the media , particularly across state-owned television .
many russians are critical of the dominance of the putin-backed party in the media .
in yekaterinburg , on the border between europe and asia , voters said they saw no alternative to united russia .

russian president vladimir putin ’ s united russia party has scored a decisive victory in sunday ’ s parliamentary elections , strengthening the leader ’ s power ahead of a likely second term next year . according to exit polls , the kremlin-backed united russia party pulled in 37 percent of votes , far ahead of the main opposition communist party , which garnered roughly 15 percent .
the snap poll conducted by the institute of comparative social studies published the first results after the last polls closed at 1800 gmt .
although final results are not expected until monday , observers are banking on a pro-government majority in the duma as the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party -lrb- ldpr -rrb- and motherland , a newly-formed leftist-nationalist party , show early counts of about 12 and 9 percent respectively .
both parties are close to the kremlin and together with united russia could hand putin a voting bloc of 58 percent in the parliament .
liberal opposition passes hurdle despite the overwhelming attention given to united russia in the country ’ s media , two small liberal parties managed to make it to the duma .
the pro-democracy parties , yabloko and the union of right forces -lrb- sps -rrb- overcame the crucial five-percent hurdle to gain a share of the proportionally allocated seats in the 450-member parliament .
exit polls gave both parties about 6 percent .
the final makeup of the duma , the lower house of parliament , could differ significantly from the early results , since only 225 seats are elected through nationwide proportional representation .
the other half of parliament is elected in individual constituencies through direct mandates .
two-thirds majority still uncertain the main question circling ahead of the final results is whether or not united russia and its pro-kremlin allies will receive a two-thirds majority , or more than 300 seats .
if that happens , it would allow putin to push through changes to the constitution including enabling him to remain in power beyond his likely second term in 2008 .
observers say this is putin ’ s goal and he has made no secret out of his preference for united russia .
on the contrary , he has lent the party his face for campaign slogans saying " together with the president . "

although final results are not expected until monday , observers are banking on a pro-government majority in the duma as the ultra-nationalist liberal democratic party -lrb- ldpr -rrb- and motherland , a newly-formed leftist-nationalist party , show early counts of about 12 and 9 percent respectively .
both parties are close to the kremlin and together with united russia could hand putin a voting bloc of 58 percent in the parliament .

the fish , called the muddy loach , eats mosquito larvae and can completely remove them from rice fields .
the research was presented at the annual meeting of the american society for tropical medicine and hygiene in the us city of philadelphia .
at the same meeting , scientists revealed how they believe farming helped spread malaria .
the concept of the muddy loach is simple : find fish which eat mosquito larvae , and put them in lakes and fields where larvae live and adult mosquitoes breed .
researchers experimented with the fish in several locations in south korea , in rice fields farmed both organically and conventionally .
they found that by putting enough fish in a field , all the mosquito larvae would be eaten within a day .
muddy loaches are omnivorous and hardy , which the researchers say make them ideally suited to the job .
revival of old technique the idea of using fish in this way dates back a century or so , but in recent decades it has fallen out of favour as more modern techniques for combating malaria , such as chemical insecticides , drugs and bednets have taken precedence .
but the researchers say muddy loaches could make a significant impact on malaria in east asia .
it could also help in other parts of the world , where there are other fish which could do a similar job , whether in rice fields or in lakes and ponds .
and at the end of the malaria season , farmers get to eat the fish as well , fat with all the larvae they have been consuming .
scientists at the conference also said they believed malaria was given a boost around 10,000 years ago in africa with the beginning of slash-and-burn agriculture .
this type of farming created small water pools where mosquitoes could breed , and a less nomadic human population to feed off .

facing problem but waste managers still face the problem of how to deal with the estimated 300,000 tonnes of rubbish produced in the two counties each year .
the plans have been put forward by estech europe ltd , based in aldridge , west midlands .
the proposed hi-tech waste treatment plant in herefordshire could treat around 100,000 tonnes a year , which would include all of herefordshire 's kerbside collections and some from worcestershire as well .
the company has applied for planning permission to build the site and council environmental officers and the waste collection contractor severn waste have backed the plans .
a planning decision is expected early next year .

at 2000 gmt on 7 december last year , 150 fire fighters took two days to put out the fire which destroyed a seven storey building on the cowgate .
the blaze was described as the most devastating in the capital .
since the incident , eight of the affected businesses formed a consortium to consider a replacement building .
although no lives were lost in the fire , businesses , ranging from an amusement arcade to the gilded balloon comedy club , were completely destroyed .
a year later , negotiations over the fate of the site continue .
some businesses were only tenants and have no legal rights .
but the consortium , including the university of edinburgh , have commissioned a feasibility study , with results expected in the spring .
it is still not know what caused the blaze , which resutled in millions of pounds worth of damage to more than a dozen properties in linked premises up to seven storeys high .
it is believed to have started close to la belle angele nightclub in the cowgate .

an 11-man team hope to confine the reptile to an area of marshland close to the border with mainland china .
the 1.5 metre-long crocodile has so far managed to elude attempts by hong kong officials and an australian hunter to capture it .
it was first sighted in the territory on 2 november , the first crocodile seen there in the wild .
team leader he zhanzhao and a colleague spent two days searching for the crocodile in the swampy suburban creek earlier in the week , but failed to catch sight of it .
they and the rest of the team returned on sunday to set net traps after the crocodile was briefly spotted in the morning , said co-ordinator chan siu-keung .
the wily reptile 's continuing escape act has made headlines around the world .
frustration australian hunter john lever headed home at the end of november after two weeks of failing to snare the beast .
he said the presence of some 600 spectators and 200 journalists had not helped his efforts .
mr lever was sceptical about the chinese team 's chances of success .
" they 've got no experience in hunting , they 're handlers , " he told the bbc 's world today programme .
the crocodile is believed to be on the run from a mainland crocodile farm , or a home where it was kept as a pet .

the british-born astronaut heard a metallic crushing sound , apparently from the rear of the zvezda living module , as he was having breakfast .
but in a satellite link-up , he has told bbc one 's breakfast with frost programme his heart did not " lurch " .
the sound is now believed to have come from equipment inside the iss .
commander foale told breakfast with frost : " i know it is hard to believe .
yes , we thought we had been hit .
yes , i thought we might have had a leak .
however , my heart just does not lurch like it should do . "
as nasa station science officer , dr foale is spending six months on the iss with only the mission 's flight engineer , russian cosmonaut sasha kaleri , for company .
foale is one of the most experienced astronauts in nasa history more details and he told breakfast with frost it was a " good day " if " neither the american side nor the russian side are angry with each other " .
" it is difficult day to day for each partner to see the point of view of the other . "
dr foale told the programme he and the russian cosmonaut would wake up at 0700 gmt and after spending the day completing tasks set by both houston and moscow go to bed at 2300 gmt .
but they would also try to find the time to share lunch , enjoy an afternoon tea break together and send e-mails home .
" unfortunately some british royal navy traditions have not carried over to the international space station yet - so the rum ration is not yet on board , " dr foale added .
the tasks set for the two men included experiments on how zero gravity affects the development of cancer cells and the crystallisation of metals , he told breakfast with frost .
but they also spent hours simply staring out of the window .
alexander kaleri and michael foale arrived at the station in october " it is a tremendous view , " dr foale told the programme .
" the earth is so blue , so rich in colour , so vivid and it has all these associations , like a good perfume or good music , that you love it , " he added .
the iss circles the earth every 90 minutes , which , dr foale told breakfast with frost , " means we see most of the inhabited part of the planet once a day " .
" so we can monitor how human beings and other factors - erosion , the weather and so on - are changing the planet . "
but although the earth was the " be all and end all " for dr foale at the moment , he told the programme , he wished he could go to mars " tomorrow " .
but he added : " i do not really believe it is very credible that one country will do it on its own .

foale is one of the most experienced astronauts in nasa history more details and he told breakfast with frost it was a " good day " if " neither the american side nor the russian side are angry with each other " .
" it is difficult day to day for each partner to see the point of view of the other . "
dr foale told the programme he and the russian cosmonaut would wake up at 0700 gmt and after spending the day completing tasks set by both houston and moscow go to bed at 2300 gmt .
but they would also try to find the time to share lunch , enjoy an afternoon tea break together and send e-mails home .
" unfortunately some british royal navy traditions have not carried over to the international space station yet - so the rum ration is not yet on board , " dr foale added .
the tasks set for the two men included experiments on how zero gravity affects the development of cancer cells and the crystallisation of metals , he told breakfast with frost .
but they also spent hours simply staring out of the window .
alexander kaleri and michael foale arrived at the station in october " it is a tremendous view , " dr foale told the programme .
" the earth is so blue , so rich in colour , so vivid and it has all these associations , like a good perfume or good music , that you love it , " he added .
the iss circles the earth every 90 minutes , which , dr foale told breakfast with frost , " means we see most of the inhabited part of the planet once a day " .
" so we can monitor how human beings and other factors - erosion , the weather and so on - are changing the planet . "
but although the earth was the " be all and end all " for dr foale at the moment , he told the programme , he wished he could go to mars " tomorrow " .
but he added : " i do not really believe it is very credible that one country will do it on its own .
" as i look at the world today and see the changing and evolving roles of the developed nations , now including china , in space , it is very hard for me to guess how the politics and international relationships will develop to create an international mission to mars . "

arriva are responsible for all services in wales , apart from long-distance virgin and first great western services .
the company has already promised that train passengers who are delayed by more than an hour will be given full refunds .
the firm , which will operate as arriva trains wales / trenau arriva cymru ltd , has also promised safer and more punctual performance , a more " user-friendly " timetable , and greater integration of trains and buses .

mr kerr insisted that hoax emergency calls were " no laughing matter " , adding : " the attack may be carried out by third parties or the hoax may even be the preface to a premeditated assault on the emergency services who are lured to the scene .
" although the emergency call may be fake , it is important that the legislation should cover emergency workers in these situations . "

" we think this should be extended to doctors and nurses , " ms robison said .
matt smith , scottish secretary of health union unison , told the sunday herald : " there is a growing trend of assaults throughout the public services , and we want to continue our discussions with the executive to ensure that all staff who face this problem are given adequate protection . "
