those on board are palestinians - but they are not from the west bank or gaza .
they are israeli arabs , some of whom have travelled for several hours to get here .
for more than two years , since the start of the latest intifada , thousands of them have been filling the narrow cobbled streets of east jerusalem every day .
they come to shop and to pray - and to uphold the city 's arab culture and traditions .
" it is a religious , spiritual and economic project which is to make them strong , " says farid haj yehje , one organiser of the trips to the city .
" we have threats , we have unique circumstances , we are at risk , if we do n't stop together , stand as one , the worst is to come . "
as israel goes through another election , the country 's arab citizens feel their vote has never meant less . "
i do n't see what difference elections will make .
i do n't think it matters whether i vote or not .
it did n't in the past " amira abu zaid more than one million israelis are palestinians who stayed on after the arab defeat of 1948 and became part of israel .
they have five political parties with 10 members in the outgoing knesset .
but since the beginning of the palestinian uprising , israeli arabs are less sure about where they fit in .
they feel alienated from what they see as an increasingly hostile state , and many are rediscovering their palestinian identity .
arabs make up 20 % of israel 's population .
but many feel they are treated as second class citizens , and the sense of alienation is growing .
makeshift homes amira abu zaid 's makeshift home is built from pieces of metal , wood and plastic .
it is large enough for her and her 10 children - so long as they sleep next to each other on the floor .
she lives here because the authorities destroyed her house .
it did not have a building permit .
but palestinians in israel say it is impossible to get them - and they are being stopped from expanding their communities .
" by destroying my house , the jews have broken me and my children for life and i no longer trust them , " she says .
" i do n't see what difference elections will make .
i do n't think it matters whether i vote or not .
it did n't in the past . "
the divide between arab areas like this one and the rest of israel is widening .
jews are becoming more afraid their palestinian neighbours will turn on them .
some have , most have not .
vulnerability the arabs are also feeling more vulnerable . "
the arab minority in general is feeling they are not welcome , that they are being pushed to the side " bothaina dabit they complain of increasing police harassment and they are angered by attempts to ban their politicians from standing in next week 's election .
" mostly it 's the young people who feel hopeless , " says bothaina dabit , a member of an arab political party .
" and the arab minority in general are feeling they are not welcome , that they are being pushed to the side . "
arab politicians are out on the campaign trail , working hard to try to encourage disaffected voters to cast their ballot next week .
it has never been more important , they say ; if the arabs boycott , the right wing will get stronger .
disillusion but critics like community activist amir makhoul say voting will not make a difference because the system is stacked against them anyway .
" we could n't use or enjoy our representation in the knesset .
it 's not because we are weak and do n't know what we want .
it 's because the system is a racist system .
" the palestinian community in israel has become a community at risk , including the members of the knesset . "
amir makhoul says israeli arabs should strengthen their own institutions and present themselves to the world as part of the palestinian problem .
the palestinians in israel do feel they are at a crossroads .
one thing is clear to them - more than 50 years after the foundation of israel , few arabs feel at home in a jewish state .

a cambridge-based company has created cheap , smart tags that can beam website links to mobile phones to give people more information about the poster , advert or shop the marker is attached to .
the smart devices , developed by a company called hypertag , use infra-red to send web links to mobile phones .
this week hypertag won a grant from the uk 's national endowment for science , technology and the arts to develop its technology .
powered poster jonathan morgan , chief executive of hypertag , said 40 % of modern mobile phones could already accept information sent via infra-red making it an obvious choice for the tagging system .
" it is just like using a remote control on the tv , " he said .
posters in film theatres could dispense trailers he added that hypertag was also working on a bluetooth version of its tag which transfers information via short-range radio link .
the links that are passed to mobile phones could lead people to be more information about historic monuments , exhibits in a museum or tell them more about products being advertised .
they could also direct consumers to sites where they can download music , movie trailers or stills from a film , said mr morgan .
because the hypertags contain only information about a web link they are small , cheap and can be powered by batteries , said mr morgan .
many mobile firms are keen to develop services based around knowing the location of their customers .
but the limitations of such systems are only slowly being overcome .
cash flow " the granularity of gps and cell-id is rather large , " said mr morgan , " and you have to have a lot of infrastructure behind it to make it work . "
by contrast , he said , the hypertag system was cheap to use and the markers could be positioned only a few centimetres apart yet give people very different information .
hypertag was founded in august 2001 and mr morgan said since then it had been working on perfecting the hypertag technology .
the six-figure cash grant given by nesta and a raft of other investors will help the company survive the next 12 months and find its first customers .
mr morgan said the company was already in talks with some companies interested in adopting its tag technology and said he expected to unveil the first customer in a matter of weeks .
