the yes vote in latvia marks the beginning of the next phase of eu enlargement , culminating in the official entry of 10 new members in may 2004 .
but before that can happen , there are still a few loose ends to tie up . on september 20 , latvia became the last of the candidate countries to approve membership in the european union .
starting in march , nine of the ten candidates - cyprus ratified eu entry in parliament without a referendum - began a series of referendums , all resulting in a strong public support for entering the bloc next may .
but the long road to brussels is not quite over for the would-be members , and before the current 15 members can officially welcome the 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries into their group , several sticking points need to be ironed out .
the first step after the referendums is the ratification of the accession treaties by the old members .
this is largely a formality and germany and denmark have already given their go-ahead .
the other 13 current members should easily follow suit .
final entry for the new members will then take place on may 1 , 2004 .
establishing the foundations for enlargement parallel to preparations for the " big bang " - that is the largest round of expansion the eu has ever undertaken - the 15 current members will work to resolve their differences over the eu constitution .
once the ink on the final wording has dried and all members have approved the first-ever constitution for europe , it will serve as the foundation for a functional , enlarged eu .
this is scheduled to take place in a series of intergovernmental talks at the beginning of october , in which all the 25 current and future members will meet in rome to discuss their political goals and outline the job criteria for europe ’ s institutions .
the basis for these discussions is the draft constitution presented back in july at the convention on the future of europe .
however , several aspects of the draft constitution have proven controversial , prompting concerns that the delicate compromises secured just three months ago will unravel .
smaller eu members have objected to the proposal that the european commission be reduced from the current 20 representatives to 15 , which would mean that each member would not have a permanent representative .
and they have also objected to efforts to replace the current six- month rotating presidency with a permanent one .
they fear these changes favor larger states like germany and france .
the debate over voting procedures – whether to have an absolute majority or to weigh the votes - remains another sticking point .
what 's more , many of the larger and powerful eu members have different ideas about the nature of the union : should it be supranational , whereby states would cede power in certain policy areas -lrb- for example , in economic and defense matters -rrb- to a higher eu authority , or should it be intergovernmental , whereby authority would remain firmly in the hands of national governments .
can they get the job done in rome ?
somehow , the 25 present and future eu members are going to have to iron out these differences .
if they do n't reach an agreement , the future of the union hangs in the balance : the eu constitution needs to be approved by five of the old eu members and all of the new members .
a failure to get enough support could irreparably damage the enlargement process .
some fear the intergovernmental conference in rome may face the same fate as the nice summit in 2000 .
there , every state fought for itself , which , according to the president of the eu commission romano prodi , meant that the treaty of nice did not contain the necessary reforms .
he and others are hoping for better luck in rome .
ever enlarging union , 2007 and beyond .
if all goes according to plan , the eu constitution will be ratified in 2005 .
and then , in 2007 , the eu can turn its attention to the next round of enlargement , as bulgaria and romania are scheduled to enter the union , and the tricky and controversial question of turkey as a member of the union will be decided .
in 2007 and beyond , the balkans , including croatia , bosnia-herzogovina , serbia-montenegro macedonia and albania , are scheduled to become members .
those countries who are hoping to join the eu further down the road , will likely be watching the events of the next few months with a great deal of interest .
a failure to successfully complete this round of enlargement will surely impact those still on the waiting list . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ten new countries to join european union dw-world takes a look at the candidate countries , the sticky issues that remain and gives you a dummy 's guide to the european union .

for three and a half weeks , the city hosts a variety of events dedicated to the composer ’ s music .
for classical fans , many of whom have traveled half way around the world , the international beethoven festival is a highlight on the music calendar .
this year the festival , which kicked off on sept .
20 with a performance by the oslo philharmonic , will feature 54 different events scattered throughout the city and nearby venues .
the program encompasses everything from the traditional classical-romantic repertoire to premiers of new works .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's memory is everywhere in his birthtown of bonn - here as a statue in the city center .
in the past , the festival organizers have placed great emphasis on attracting world famous orchestras , conductors and soloists to perform beethoven ’ s greatest masterpieces .
this year will be no different ; several renowned orchestras will be participating in the events , including the berlin philharmonic and the concertgebouw orchester from amsterdam .
six beethoven symphonies , all five piano concertos and a complete cycle of the 16 string quartets are featured on the program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven festival in bonn from sept .
20 to oct .
10 , 2003 .
charting new territory less the classical music fan fear a one-composer festival , the organizers have decided to highlight composers beethoven is perceived to have influenced .
this year the spotlight is turned to the modernism of the second viennese school and its composers alban berg , arnold schönberg and anton von webern .
franz willnauer , the festival ’ s director , believes such a combination of old and new will present both a " challenge to audiences " and a step into new territory for the festival .
" we ’ ve given our concept an underlying theme that is unusual and challenging but bound to generate interest among music lovers even far outside of bonn , " says willnauer , whose five-year tenure comes to an end this year .
despite breaking new ground by offering music from the second viennese school , the director views the more modern composers as beethoven ’ s heirs .
" arnold schönberg and his circle regarded their retrospective glance at the viennese classics , and especially beethoven , as a deep-seated obligation ...
our ambition was to bring these connections to the surface , " the director explains in the festival 's web site .
for the festival ’ s director , the most important aspect about hosting the annual event is the opportunity to present beethoven not as a figure from a museum , but rather as a " great innovator , who has influenced composers over the centuries .

the yes vote in latvia marks the beginning of the next phase of eu enlargement , culminating in the official entry of 10 new members in may 2004 .
but before that can happen , there are still a few loose ends to tie up . on september 20 , latvia became the last of the candidate countries to approve membership in the european union .
starting in march , nine of the ten candidates - cyprus ratified eu entry in parliament without a referendum - began a series of referendums , all resulting in a strong public support for entering the bloc next may .
but the long road to brussels is not quite over for the would-be members , and before the current 15 members can officially welcome the 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries into their group , several sticking points need to be ironed out .
the first step after the referendums is the ratification of the accession treaties by the old members .
this is largely a formality and germany and denmark have already given their go-ahead .
the other 13 current members should easily follow suit .
final entry for the new members will then take place on may 1 , 2004 .
establishing the foundations for enlargement parallel to preparations for the " big bang " - that is the largest round of expansion the eu has ever undertaken - the 15 current members will work to resolve their differences over the eu constitution .
once the ink on the final wording has dried and all members have approved the first-ever constitution for europe , it will serve as the foundation for a functional , enlarged eu .
this is scheduled to take place in a series of intergovernmental talks at the beginning of october , in which all the 25 current and future members will meet in rome to discuss their political goals and outline the job criteria for europe ’ s institutions .
the basis for these discussions is the draft constitution presented back in july at the convention on the future of europe .
however , several aspects of the draft constitution have proven controversial , prompting concerns that the delicate compromises secured just three months ago will unravel .
smaller eu members have objected to the proposal that the european commission be reduced from the current 20 representatives to 15 , which would mean that each member would not have a permanent representative .
and they have also objected to efforts to replace the current six- month rotating presidency with a permanent one .
they fear these changes favor larger states like germany and france .
the debate over voting procedures – whether to have an absolute majority or to weigh the votes - remains another sticking point .
what 's more , many of the larger and powerful eu members have different ideas about the nature of the union : should it be supranational , whereby states would cede power in certain policy areas -lrb- for example , in economic and defense matters -rrb- to a higher eu authority , or should it be intergovernmental , whereby authority would remain firmly in the hands of national governments .
can they get the job done in rome ?
somehow , the 25 present and future eu members are going to have to iron out these differences .
if they do n't reach an agreement , the future of the union hangs in the balance : the eu constitution needs to be approved by five of the old eu members and all of the new members .
a failure to get enough support could irreparably damage the enlargement process .
some fear the intergovernmental conference in rome may face the same fate as the nice summit in 2000 .
there , every state fought for itself , which , according to the president of the eu commission romano prodi , meant that the treaty of nice did not contain the necessary reforms .
he and others are hoping for better luck in rome .
ever enlarging union , 2007 and beyond .
if all goes according to plan , the eu constitution will be ratified in 2005 .
and then , in 2007 , the eu can turn its attention to the next round of enlargement , as bulgaria and romania are scheduled to enter the union , and the tricky and controversial question of turkey as a member of the union will be decided .
in 2007 and beyond , the balkans , including croatia , bosnia-herzogovina , serbia-montenegro macedonia and albania , are scheduled to become members .

establishing the foundations for enlargement parallel to preparations for the " big bang " - that is the largest round of expansion the eu has ever undertaken - the 15 current members will work to resolve their differences over the eu constitution .
once the ink on the final wording has dried and all members have approved the first-ever constitution for europe , it will serve as the foundation for a functional , enlarged eu .
this is scheduled to take place in a series of intergovernmental talks at the beginning of october , in which all the 25 current and future members will meet in rome to discuss their political goals and outline the job criteria for europe ’ s institutions .
the basis for these discussions is the draft constitution presented back in july at the convention on the future of europe .
however , several aspects of the draft constitution have proven controversial , prompting concerns that the delicate compromises secured just three months ago will unravel .
smaller eu members have objected to the proposal that the european commission be reduced from the current 20 representatives to 15 , which would mean that each member would not have a permanent representative .
and they have also objected to efforts to replace the current six- month rotating presidency with a permanent one .
they fear these changes favor larger states like germany and france .
the debate over voting procedures – whether to have an absolute majority or to weigh the votes - remains another sticking point .
what 's more , many of the larger and powerful eu members have different ideas about the nature of the union : should it be supranational , whereby states would cede power in certain policy areas -lrb- for example , in economic and defense matters -rrb- to a higher eu authority , or should it be intergovernmental , whereby authority would remain firmly in the hands of national governments .
can they get the job done in rome ?
somehow , the 25 present and future eu members are going to have to iron out these differences .
if they do n't reach an agreement , the future of the union hangs in the balance : the eu constitution needs to be approved by five of the old eu members and all of the new members .
a failure to get enough support could irreparably damage the enlargement process .
some fear the intergovernmental conference in rome may face the same fate as the nice summit in 2000 .

the yes vote in latvia marks the beginning of the next phase of eu enlargement , culminating in the official entry of 10 new members in may 2004 .
but before that can happen , there are still a few loose ends to tie up . on september 20 , latvia became the last of the candidate countries to approve membership in the european union .
starting in march , nine of the ten candidates - cyprus ratified eu entry in parliament without a referendum - began a series of referendums , all resulting in a strong public support for entering the bloc next may .
but the long road to brussels is not quite over for the would-be members , and before the current 15 members can officially welcome the 10 eastern european and mediterranean countries into their group , several sticking points need to be ironed out .
the first step after the referendums is the ratification of the accession treaties by the old members .
this is largely a formality and germany and denmark have already given their go-ahead .
the other 13 current members should easily follow suit .
final entry for the new members will then take place on may 1 , 2004 .

" it is conceivable that there will be a zero fee for students from certain families with low incomes . "
currently , universities charge a flat £ 1,125 a year for all undergraduate courses .
ministers want to allow institutions to charge " differential fees " , as they call them , of between nothing and £ 3,000 a year for their courses .
the fees would be in the form of a loan paid back by students upon graduation , rather than paid upfront as they are now .
' easier entrance ' mr clarke said he had not yet decided the income threshold below which students would be completely exempt from top-up fees .
but it could be that students will qualify if their family 's household income is less than £ 15,200 a year .
that is also the threshold which will be applied for the new £ 1,000 student maintenance grants which are to be reintroduced from next year .
the move is being seen as a concession to labour mps opposed to the higher fees , ahead of the debate on the legislation which is due to come to the commons in december .

charles clarke told the sunday telegraph the government was determined to allow universities in england and wales to charge higher tuition fees .
but he said some students could be helped out by bursary or fee remission schemes .
" it is to make sure that students from the poorer families are able to go to the universities which are charging the highest fees , " he said .
" it is conceivable that there will be a zero fee for students from certain families with low incomes . "
currently , universities charge a flat £ 1,125 a year for all undergraduate courses .
ministers want to allow institutions to charge " differential fees " , as they call them , of between nothing and £ 3,000 a year for their courses .
the fees would be in the form of a loan paid back by students upon graduation , rather than paid upfront as they are now .
' easier entrance ' mr clarke said he had not yet decided the income threshold below which students would be completely exempt from top-up fees .
but it could be that students will qualify if their family 's household income is less than £ 15,200 a year .
that is also the threshold which will be applied for the new £ 1,000 student maintenance grants which are to be reintroduced from next year .

the front page of the sunday express warns there could soon be riots on the streets because of the levels of council tax .
the paper claims the police are concerned that a threatened revolt by pensioners in devon and cornwall over the issue could spread around the country .
but the sunday telegraph reports that the government plans to ease the burden on taxpayers by allowing local councils to generate more revenue from business instead .
the mail on sunday is far from impressed by this idea .
it decides that " gordon brown has reached the limits of consent " and warns the chancellor to reduce spending instead of raising taxes .
the news of the world is also concerned about what it describes as a " collapse in the government 's finances " .
the paper claims a crisis has erupted because mr brown has spent too much on public sector pay deals and on the public services .
the observer turns its attention to the prime minister , claiming that he suffered an " embarrassing setback " while on his trip to berlin to iron out differences over iraq with the german chancellor and the french president .

the sunday mirror claims that saddam hussein has been in secret negotiation with the americans for several days .

in its latest world development report , an annual examination of the state of poorer economies , the world bank has focused on provision of services .
without improvement in services , the bank said " freedom from illness and freedom from illiteracy - two of the most important ways poor people can escape poverty - will remain elusive to many . "
at the same time , even modest investments in education , sanitation , nutrition , electricity or other necessities can pay huge dividends for the developing world .

donor countries have pledged to increase aid over the next few years , amid warnings that the so-called millennium development goal poverty reduction targets may not be met .
the goals call for a halving of global poverty , as well as broad improvements in various aspects of human development , by 2015 by arguing the case for improvements in services , the world bank hopes to ensure that increased aid is not wasted .
bad service so far , the bank warns , shoddy services are responsible for incalculable suffering .
world bank chief james wolfensohn wants to spark a debate many basic services are completely lacking : 2.5 billion people worldwide have no access to improved sanitation , for example .
but the real issue is the poor quality of the services that exist , the bank said .
the middle east , for example , spends more per head on education than any other developing region , but has some of the highest illiteracy rates .
only 41 % of angolan children are immunised against tuberculosis , compared with close to 100 % throughout the rich world .
and only 12 % of births in bangladesh are attended by skilled medical staff , compared with near-universal midwife coverage in developed economies .
rapid improvement a little effort can make a significant difference , the bank said .
a mexican initiative to give cash to poor households if they attended a clinic regularly and sent children to school reduced childhood illness by 20 % and increased secondary enrolment by up to 8 percentage points .
in indonesia , revenues from oil exploration were directed to education , doubling primary school enrolment to 90 % .
but economics often eliminates the incentives for such projects , leaving developing-country governments and service providers with little interest in targeting the poor .
" services can work when poor people stand at the centre of service provision - when they can avoid poor providers , while rewarding good providers with their clientele , and when their voices are heard by politicians , " said shanta devarajan of the world bank 's human development network .

the middle east , for example , spends more per head on education than any other developing region , but has some of the highest illiteracy rates .
only 41 % of angolan children are immunised against tuberculosis , compared with close to 100 % throughout the rich world .
and only 12 % of births in bangladesh are attended by skilled medical staff , compared with near-universal midwife coverage in developed economies .
rapid improvement a little effort can make a significant difference , the bank said .
a mexican initiative to give cash to poor households if they attended a clinic regularly and sent children to school reduced childhood illness by 20 % and increased secondary enrolment by up to 8 percentage points .
in indonesia , revenues from oil exploration were directed to education , doubling primary school enrolment to 90 % .
but economics often eliminates the incentives for such projects , leaving developing-country governments and service providers with little interest in targeting the poor .
" services can work when poor people stand at the centre of service provision - when they can avoid poor providers , while rewarding good providers with their clientele , and when their voices are heard by politicians , " said shanta devarajan of the world bank 's human development network .

armoured vehicles are said to be patrolling the streets of the city after crowds attacked several government buildings and set police jeeps on fire on saturday .
the violence was triggered by the deaths of two prisoners in a jail , which relatives blamed on the police .
one eyewitness to the trouble in the jail said it started with a fight between two inmates .
when the security forces intervened a policeman was hit by a prisoner .
the eyewitness says this man was then taken out , assaulted and then died of his injuries .
this is said to have triggered a riot , during which the security forces reportedly fired kalashnikov rifles at the prisoners , injuring an unknown number of them .
the prisoners are now chained and handcuffed .
it was when the casualties were sent to the hospital in male that unrest broke out there .
relatives and friends of the dead threw stones at government buildings and set vehicles on fire in an unusual show of protest against the government of president maumoon abdul gayoom , who has been in power for 25 years .
reports from male say the family of one of the dead men will not allow him to be buried and police are preventing mourners from gathering at the house .
international flights to and from the maldives have not been affected , because the airport is on a different island from the town and consular officials say there has been no impact on tourists .

they say the cost of implementing the new regulations is making it impossible to continue .
the vapour recovery system directive is designed to stop petrol vapours from polluting the atmosphere and will apply to even the smallest of petrol stations .
european commission spokesman henning arp said leaking petrol fumes affect people with heart conditions and asthma as well as damaging crops . "
with the advent of hypermarkets and increased competition we have to look elsewhere for our profits " david hollis " petrol vapours contribute to ozone formation which is a particularly difficult and hazardous form of air pollution , " he said .
" when we looked at different options for reducing emissions this was one of the least costly ways of reducing emissions . "
one filling station owner , john ongaro , estimated it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to install the new underground reservoir and pipe work to satisfy the directive 's demands .
he said the directive is the latest blow for small petrol stations , which have spent the last few years struggling in a hostile market place .
and he has now stopped selling petrol at his garage at st just in penwith in cornwall and will concentrate on car sales and repairs and mots in the future .
" such capital would never be justified , " he said .
" i would never see a return on it .
i would be selling petrol until i was 100 and even then i 'd be paying back loans . "
mr ongaro 's mp , st ives liberal democrat andrew george , said independent petrol retailers in his constituency " had their backs against the wall " .
" in the last five years especially they have been under particular pressure , especially as the supermarkets have moved into this area , " he said .
dwindling fuel profits both the aa and the petrol retailers ' association advise small independents to diversify and build other aspects of their business .
dave hollis has acted on that advice and built up a successful spar shop , enabling him to supplement dwindling fuel profits at his south hams petrol station .
" with the advent of hypermarkets and increased competition we have to look elsewhere for our profits , " he said .
" we hope we 've got our sums right and our position right and i hope that we 'll survive . "

the vapour recovery system directive is designed to stop petrol vapours from polluting the atmosphere and will apply to even the smallest of petrol stations .
european commission spokesman henning arp said leaking petrol fumes affect people with heart conditions and asthma as well as damaging crops .
with the advent of hypermarkets and increased competition we have to look elsewhere for our profits david hollis " petrol vapours contribute to ozone formation which is a particularly difficult and hazardous form of air pollution , " he said .
" when we looked at different options for reducing emissions this was one of the least costly ways of reducing emissions . "
one filling station owner , john ongaro , estimated it would cost tens of thousands of pounds to install the new underground reservoir and pipe work to satisfy the directive 's demands .
he said the directive is the latest blow for small petrol stations , which have spent the last few years struggling in a hostile market place .
and he has now stopped selling petrol at his garage at st just in penwith in cornwall and will concentrate on car sales and repairs and mots in the future .
" such capital would never be justified , " he said .
" i would never see a return on it .
i would be selling petrol until i was 100 and even then i 'd be paying back loans . "

dave hollis has acted on that advice and built up a successful spar shop , enabling him to supplement dwindling fuel profits at his south hams petrol station .
