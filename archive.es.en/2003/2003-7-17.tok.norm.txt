protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .
vuyiseka dubula from the treatment action campaign in south africa told assembled reporters outside the venue , “ today ’ s donor conference was a scandal .
there were no meaningful pledges .
the wealthiest countries in the world are refusing the amounts of money needed in 2003 and 2004 to begin to save our lives . ” commenting on the speeches made by romano prodi , jacques chirac and kofi annan amongst others , dubula pointed out that funds have not been pledged , nor is there a timetable indicating when they may arrive . uphill battle for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv / aids antiretroviral drug kit .
scientists added to the calls for leaders to do more and to ensure that treatments were distributed to those who needed them .
professor christine katlama from the pitie-saltpetriere hospital in paris said , “ when we fight for aids , we fight for the world and all infected hiv patients . ” “ you can not ask the scientists to find new treatments and when they 've found treatments , they 're not available for 90 percent of patients .

but some worry that the country 's once-insatiable auto market may soon be facing a glut . vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder said his company plans to invest around € 6 billion -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in china over the next five years , including building a new factory with its first automation works joint-venture partner , and making improvements to two already exisiting facilities .
as a result , output will be raised to about 1.6 million vehicles a year from a current 80,000 by 2008 .
vw is making the move in the hopes of holding on to its market-leading position in china .
falling market share first-half year-on-year sales leapt 52 percent , but the company 's market share dropped to 34 percent from 40 percent .
the drop reflects the overall rapid growth of the chinese car market and the increasing threat of competition from local competitors .
" the market is outpacing our -lrb- production -rrb- increase , " michael wilkes , volkswagen 's china spokesman , said .
yet some analysts have warned that capacity may be outpacing demand , threatening a glut and possible price war that could hit margins hard .
china 's state statistical bureau warned last month that some 10,000 cars ended up sitting in warehouses in april and may - despite sales jumping due to the outbreak of the deadly sars virus , which scared people away from public transportation .
rivals afoot the expansion will be financed from the chinese joint ventures themselves .
vw , which is battling falling sales in its european markets , has invested € 3 billion euros in china so far and is by far the largest auto maker in the country .
but others are planning similar expansion projects , including rivals general motors and nissan motor corp. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen ceo bernd pischetsrieder , left , helps place the corner stone for a new factory in changchun on july 15 , 2003 .

at the same time , volkswagen 's venture in china 's commercial hub , shanghai volkswagen automotive , will raise output by 75 percent .

protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .
vuyiseka dubula from the treatment action campaign in south africa told assembled reporters outside the venue , “ today ’ s donor conference was a scandal .
there were no meaningful pledges .
the wealthiest countries in the world are refusing the amounts of money needed in 2003 and 2004 to begin to save our lives . ” commenting on the speeches made by romano prodi , jacques chirac and kofi annan amongst others , dubula pointed out that funds have not been pledged , nor is there a timetable indicating when they may arrive . uphill battle for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv / aids antiretroviral drug kit .
scientists added to the calls for leaders to do more and to ensure that treatments were distributed to those who needed them .
professor christine katlama from the pitie-saltpetriere hospital in paris said , “ when we fight for aids , we fight for the world and all infected hiv patients . ” “ you can not ask the scientists to find new treatments and when they 've found treatments , they 're not available for 90 percent of patients .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .
business at the ready " we are not part of the coalition , but we are ready to improve the humanitarian situation .
our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .
the united states is currently discussing how to deal with the situation , powell said .

the tide has clearly turned in recent weeks . on wednesday fischer described berlin-washington ties as " excellent . "
but does that mean all is forgiven between berlin and washington ?
" it 's not about forgiveness or anything like that .
those are n't political categories , " fischer said .
instead , the pair spoke about bringing the strategic security debate between the u.s. and europe into gear .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .
business at the ready " we are not part of the coalition , but we are ready to improve the humanitarian situation .
our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .
the united states is currently discussing how to deal with the situation , powell said .

so far eu citizens have only been able to rely on common sense to tell them that these promises are often empty .
but a new european commission draft directive aims to give consumers more security by banning misleading ads .
european union health and consumer affairs commissioner david byrne introduced the draft on wednesday .
if approved , from 2005 onwards , ads with promising vague and unverifiable qualities like weight loss , improved concentration or boosting energy would be prohibited . but the directive must still be approved by the european parliament and the council of ministers before it can be implemented . " it 's not an advertising ban at heart , but rather it 's about information regarding nutrition and health , " european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told deutsche welle . the draft identifies 24 phrases like " fat-free , " " light " and " high in fiber " that may only be used if they are backed up by scientific data .
advertisers who want to say a product is " low fat " will have to prove that it has less than three percent fat .
" sugar free " could only be used if a product had no more than 0.5 grams of sugar per 100 grams .
muesli would only be " high in fiber " if at least 6 percent was fiber . food manufacturers in the eu must currently list all ingredients on labels , but they are not required to reveal their products ' nutritional value .
over the next three years the european commission will determine what must or can not be on a label .
manufacturers will then have to submit their products to the eu health and safety authority for approval .
for example , advertisers will most likely be allowed to maintain that a product with calcium is good for the bones .
but the claim that herbal drinks improve concentration will probably not make the cut - unless the manufacturer can show proof . german consumer protection groups have welcomed the eu 's plans .
the draft will bring an end to years of disputes over clarity , the german association of consumer protection organizations announced . auntie eu but advertisers are incensed by the proposal .
the " governess-like eu " imposes its will on its citizens , the head of germany 's federal association for consumer protection , volker nickel , told deutsche welle .
nickel said the draft signaled a " return to the socialist planned economy . " the draft represents a threat to competition and freedom of expression and will also harm businesses , nickel claimed .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.07.2003 eu seeks ban on ' misleading ' ads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer protection : looking for truth in advertising the european commission wants to make the media more honest by banning advertising with claims that ca n't be scientifically proven , putting an end to dubious " fat free " or " high fiber " labels . if you were to believe everything advertisements tell you , supermarket shelves would be packed with products that keep you healthy , young , thin and happy .
so far eu citizens have only been able to rely on common sense to tell them that these promises are often empty .
but a new european commission draft directive aims to give consumers more security by banning misleading ads .
european union health and consumer affairs commissioner david byrne introduced the draft on wednesday .
if approved , from 2005 onwards , ads with promising vague and unverifiable qualities like weight loss , improved concentration or boosting energy would be prohibited . but the directive must still be approved by the european parliament and the council of ministers before it can be implemented . " it 's not an advertising ban at heart , but rather it 's about information regarding nutrition and health , " european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told deutsche welle . the draft identifies 24 phrases like " fat-free , " " light " and " high in fiber " that may only be used if they are backed up by scientific data .
advertisers who want to say a product is " low fat " will have to prove that it has less than three percent fat .
" sugar free " could only be used if a product had no more than 0.5 grams of sugar per 100 grams .
muesli would only be " high in fiber " if at least 6 percent was fiber . food manufacturers in the eu must currently list all ingredients on labels , but they are not required to reveal their products ' nutritional value .
over the next three years the european commission will determine what must or can not be on a label .
manufacturers will then have to submit their products to the eu health and safety authority for approval .
for example , advertisers will most likely be allowed to maintain that a product with calcium is good for the bones .
but the claim that herbal drinks improve concentration will probably not make the cut - unless the manufacturer can show proof . german consumer protection groups have welcomed the eu 's plans .
the draft will bring an end to years of disputes over clarity , the german association of consumer protection organizations announced . auntie eu but advertisers are incensed by the proposal .
the " governess-like eu " imposes its will on its citizens , the head of germany 's federal association for consumer protection , volker nickel , told deutsche welle .
nickel said the draft signaled a " return to the socialist planned economy . " the draft represents a threat to competition and freedom of expression and will also harm businesses , nickel claimed .
he estimated that advertising expenditures would drop significantly " if advertising must first go through the brussels censor . "
nickel said the regulations were " outrageous , " especially since german law already punishes scientifically inaccurate statements with sentences of up to two years jail .
" i would like to see that applied to politicians and bureaucrats , " nickel added . european commission spokeswoman beate gminder refused to respond to nickel 's comments .
the directive responded to consumers concerns , which was confirmed by the positive reactions to a " long overdue undertaking , " she told deutsche welle . negative coverage of the planned directive had only surfaced in germany and austria , gminder said .
but she would n't explain exactly why the resistance came from germany and austria .
she just said the reasons were philosophical rather than political , " which i have no answer to as an eu spokeswoman .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .

our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .
the united states is currently discussing how to deal with the situation , powell said .

sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .

protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .
business at the ready " we are not part of the coalition , but we are ready to improve the humanitarian situation .
our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .
the united states is currently discussing how to deal with the situation , powell said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.07.2003 aids conference ends with pledges and protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global fund needs more money to continue its fight against hiv / aids at the end of the international conference on aids in paris on wednesday , world leaders talked of funding in excess of a billion dollars each .
protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .
vuyiseka dubula from the treatment action campaign in south africa told assembled reporters outside the venue , “ today ’ s donor conference was a scandal .
there were no meaningful pledges .
the wealthiest countries in the world are refusing the amounts of money needed in 2003 and 2004 to begin to save our lives . ” commenting on the speeches made by romano prodi , jacques chirac and kofi annan amongst others , dubula pointed out that funds have not been pledged , nor is there a timetable indicating when they may arrive . uphill battle for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv / aids antiretroviral drug kit .
scientists added to the calls for leaders to do more and to ensure that treatments were distributed to those who needed them .
professor christine katlama from the pitie-saltpetriere hospital in paris said , “ when we fight for aids , we fight for the world and all infected hiv patients . ” “ you can not ask the scientists to find new treatments and when they 've found treatments , they 're not available for 90 percent of patients .
no , they can not accept that millions will die and the silent people who die every day . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticized as aids donor conference opens prior to the start of an aids donor conference in paris wednesday , the german government is facing criticism that it wo n't contribute the funds needed to match america 's $ 1 billion pledge to the global aids fund .

protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .
vuyiseka dubula from the treatment action campaign in south africa told assembled reporters outside the venue , “ today ’ s donor conference was a scandal .
there were no meaningful pledges .
the wealthiest countries in the world are refusing the amounts of money needed in 2003 and 2004 to begin to save our lives . ” commenting on the speeches made by romano prodi , jacques chirac and kofi annan amongst others , dubula pointed out that funds have not been pledged , nor is there a timetable indicating when they may arrive . uphill battle for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv / aids antiretroviral drug kit .
scientists added to the calls for leaders to do more and to ensure that treatments were distributed to those who needed them .
professor christine katlama from the pitie-saltpetriere hospital in paris said , “ when we fight for aids , we fight for the world and all infected hiv patients . ” “ you can not ask the scientists to find new treatments and when they 've found treatments , they 're not available for 90 percent of patients .
no , they can not accept that millions will die and the silent people who die every day . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticized as aids donor conference opens prior to the start of an aids donor conference in paris wednesday , the german government is facing criticism that it wo n't contribute the funds needed to match america 's $ 1 billion pledge to the global aids fund .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .
germany is also expected to record a third year in the eu red - a scenario that could see both countries facing hefty fines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac ’ s call for softer pact creates uproar jacques chirac ’ s bastille day statement calling for temporary measures to relax the eu ’ s stability and growth pact has caused outrage among euro zone finance ministers .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .
germany is also expected to record a third year in the eu red - a scenario that could see both countries facing hefty fines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac ’ s call for softer pact creates uproar jacques chirac ’ s bastille day statement calling for temporary measures to relax the eu ’ s stability and growth pact has caused outrage among euro zone finance ministers .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .
business at the ready " we are not part of the coalition , but we are ready to improve the humanitarian situation .
our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .
the united states is currently discussing how to deal with the situation , powell said .

protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .
vuyiseka dubula from the treatment action campaign in south africa told assembled reporters outside the venue , “ today ’ s donor conference was a scandal .
there were no meaningful pledges .
the wealthiest countries in the world are refusing the amounts of money needed in 2003 and 2004 to begin to save our lives . ” commenting on the speeches made by romano prodi , jacques chirac and kofi annan amongst others , dubula pointed out that funds have not been pledged , nor is there a timetable indicating when they may arrive . uphill battle for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv / aids antiretroviral drug kit .
scientists added to the calls for leaders to do more and to ensure that treatments were distributed to those who needed them .
professor christine katlama from the pitie-saltpetriere hospital in paris said , “ when we fight for aids , we fight for the world and all infected hiv patients . ” “ you can not ask the scientists to find new treatments and when they 've found treatments , they 're not available for 90 percent of patients .
no , they can not accept that millions will die and the silent people who die every day . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticized as aids donor conference opens prior to the start of an aids donor conference in paris wednesday , the german government is facing criticism that it wo n't contribute the funds needed to match america 's $ 1 billion pledge to the global aids fund .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .
business at the ready " we are not part of the coalition , but we are ready to improve the humanitarian situation .
our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .
the united states is currently discussing how to deal with the situation , powell said .

but some worry that the country 's once-insatiable auto market may soon be facing a glut . vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder said his company plans to invest around € 6 billion -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in china over the next five years , including building a new factory with its first automation works joint-venture partner , and making improvements to two already exisiting facilities .
as a result , output will be raised to about 1.6 million vehicles a year from a current 80,000 by 2008 .
vw is making the move in the hopes of holding on to its market-leading position in china .
falling market share first-half year-on-year sales leapt 52 percent , but the company 's market share dropped to 34 percent from 40 percent .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .
germany is also expected to record a third year in the eu red - a scenario that could see both countries facing hefty fines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac ’ s call for softer pact creates uproar jacques chirac ’ s bastille day statement calling for temporary measures to relax the eu ’ s stability and growth pact has caused outrage among euro zone finance ministers .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .
business at the ready " we are not part of the coalition , but we are ready to improve the humanitarian situation .
our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .
the united states is currently discussing how to deal with the situation , powell said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice fischer also met with u.s. national security adviser condoleezza rice -lrb- photo -rrb- .
at the height of u.s.-german discord last autumn , rice described the relationship between the two countries as " poisoned . "
the tide has clearly turned in recent weeks . on wednesday fischer described berlin-washington ties as " excellent . "
but does that mean all is forgiven between berlin and washington ?
" it 's not about forgiveness or anything like that .
those are n't political categories , " fischer said .
instead , the pair spoke about bringing the strategic security debate between the u.s. and europe into gear .
previously during his visit , fischer called for further steps toward building up a new iraqi government . in an interview earlier this week with the u.s. public broadcaster pbs , fischer said the newly appointed governing council in iraq was a " step in the right direction .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .
germany is also expected to record a third year in the eu red - a scenario that could see both countries facing hefty fines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac ’ s call for softer pact creates uproar jacques chirac ’ s bastille day statement calling for temporary measures to relax the eu ’ s stability and growth pact has caused outrage among euro zone finance ministers .

protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .
vuyiseka dubula from the treatment action campaign in south africa told assembled reporters outside the venue , “ today ’ s donor conference was a scandal .
there were no meaningful pledges .
the wealthiest countries in the world are refusing the amounts of money needed in 2003 and 2004 to begin to save our lives . ” commenting on the speeches made by romano prodi , jacques chirac and kofi annan amongst others , dubula pointed out that funds have not been pledged , nor is there a timetable indicating when they may arrive . uphill battle for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv / aids antiretroviral drug kit .

the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .

french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .
germany is also expected to record a third year in the eu red - a scenario that could see both countries facing hefty fines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac ’ s call for softer pact creates uproar jacques chirac ’ s bastille day statement calling for temporary measures to relax the eu ’ s stability and growth pact has caused outrage among euro zone finance ministers .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .

but some worry that the country 's once-insatiable auto market may soon be facing a glut . vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder said his company plans to invest around € 6 billion -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in china over the next five years , including building a new factory with its first automation works joint-venture partner , and making improvements to two already exisiting facilities .
as a result , output will be raised to about 1.6 million vehicles a year from a current 80,000 by 2008 .
vw is making the move in the hopes of holding on to its market-leading position in china .
falling market share first-half year-on-year sales leapt 52 percent , but the company 's market share dropped to 34 percent from 40 percent .
the drop reflects the overall rapid growth of the chinese car market and the increasing threat of competition from local competitors .
" the market is outpacing our -lrb- production -rrb- increase , " michael wilkes , volkswagen 's china spokesman , said .
yet some analysts have warned that capacity may be outpacing demand , threatening a glut and possible price war that could hit margins hard .
china 's state statistical bureau warned last month that some 10,000 cars ended up sitting in warehouses in april and may - despite sales jumping due to the outbreak of the deadly sars virus , which scared people away from public transportation .
rivals afoot the expansion will be financed from the chinese joint ventures themselves .
vw , which is battling falling sales in its european markets , has invested € 3 billion euros in china so far and is by far the largest auto maker in the country .
but others are planning similar expansion projects , including rivals general motors and nissan motor corp. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen ceo bernd pischetsrieder , left , helps place the corner stone for a new factory in changchun on july 15 , 2003 .

these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .

our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .

protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .
vuyiseka dubula from the treatment action campaign in south africa told assembled reporters outside the venue , “ today ’ s donor conference was a scandal .
there were no meaningful pledges .
the wealthiest countries in the world are refusing the amounts of money needed in 2003 and 2004 to begin to save our lives . ” commenting on the speeches made by romano prodi , jacques chirac and kofi annan amongst others , dubula pointed out that funds have not been pledged , nor is there a timetable indicating when they may arrive . uphill battle for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv / aids antiretroviral drug kit .
scientists added to the calls for leaders to do more and to ensure that treatments were distributed to those who needed them .
professor christine katlama from the pitie-saltpetriere hospital in paris said , “ when we fight for aids , we fight for the world and all infected hiv patients . ” “ you can not ask the scientists to find new treatments and when they 've found treatments , they 're not available for 90 percent of patients .
no , they can not accept that millions will die and the silent people who die every day . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticized as aids donor conference opens prior to the start of an aids donor conference in paris wednesday , the german government is facing criticism that it wo n't contribute the funds needed to match america 's $ 1 billion pledge to the global aids fund .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .
business at the ready " we are not part of the coalition , but we are ready to improve the humanitarian situation .
our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .
the united states is currently discussing how to deal with the situation , powell said .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .
germany is also expected to record a third year in the eu red - a scenario that could see both countries facing hefty fines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac ’ s call for softer pact creates uproar jacques chirac ’ s bastille day statement calling for temporary measures to relax the eu ’ s stability and growth pact has caused outrage among euro zone finance ministers .

schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .

protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .
vuyiseka dubula from the treatment action campaign in south africa told assembled reporters outside the venue , “ today ’ s donor conference was a scandal .
there were no meaningful pledges .
the wealthiest countries in the world are refusing the amounts of money needed in 2003 and 2004 to begin to save our lives . ” commenting on the speeches made by romano prodi , jacques chirac and kofi annan amongst others , dubula pointed out that funds have not been pledged , nor is there a timetable indicating when they may arrive . uphill battle for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv / aids antiretroviral drug kit .
scientists added to the calls for leaders to do more and to ensure that treatments were distributed to those who needed them .
professor christine katlama from the pitie-saltpetriere hospital in paris said , “ when we fight for aids , we fight for the world and all infected hiv patients . ” “ you can not ask the scientists to find new treatments and when they 've found treatments , they 're not available for 90 percent of patients .
no , they can not accept that millions will die and the silent people who die every day . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticized as aids donor conference opens prior to the start of an aids donor conference in paris wednesday , the german government is facing criticism that it wo n't contribute the funds needed to match america 's $ 1 billion pledge to the global aids fund .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .

protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .
vuyiseka dubula from the treatment action campaign in south africa told assembled reporters outside the venue , “ today ’ s donor conference was a scandal .
there were no meaningful pledges .
the wealthiest countries in the world are refusing the amounts of money needed in 2003 and 2004 to begin to save our lives . ” commenting on the speeches made by romano prodi , jacques chirac and kofi annan amongst others , dubula pointed out that funds have not been pledged , nor is there a timetable indicating when they may arrive . uphill battle for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv / aids antiretroviral drug kit .
scientists added to the calls for leaders to do more and to ensure that treatments were distributed to those who needed them .
professor christine katlama from the pitie-saltpetriere hospital in paris said , “ when we fight for aids , we fight for the world and all infected hiv patients . ” “ you can not ask the scientists to find new treatments and when they 've found treatments , they 're not available for 90 percent of patients .
no , they can not accept that millions will die and the silent people who die every day . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticized as aids donor conference opens prior to the start of an aids donor conference in paris wednesday , the german government is facing criticism that it wo n't contribute the funds needed to match america 's $ 1 billion pledge to the global aids fund .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .
germany is also expected to record a third year in the eu red - a scenario that could see both countries facing hefty fines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac ’ s call for softer pact creates uproar jacques chirac ’ s bastille day statement calling for temporary measures to relax the eu ’ s stability and growth pact has caused outrage among euro zone finance ministers .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .
business at the ready " we are not part of the coalition , but we are ready to improve the humanitarian situation .
our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .
the united states is currently discussing how to deal with the situation , powell said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice fischer also met with u.s. national security adviser condoleezza rice -lrb- photo -rrb- .
at the height of u.s.-german discord last autumn , rice described the relationship between the two countries as " poisoned . "
the tide has clearly turned in recent weeks . on wednesday fischer described berlin-washington ties as " excellent . "
but does that mean all is forgiven between berlin and washington ?
" it 's not about forgiveness or anything like that .
those are n't political categories , " fischer said .
instead , the pair spoke about bringing the strategic security debate between the u.s. and europe into gear .
previously during his visit , fischer called for further steps toward building up a new iraqi government . in an interview earlier this week with the u.s. public broadcaster pbs , fischer said the newly appointed governing council in iraq was a " step in the right direction .

the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .

protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .
vuyiseka dubula from the treatment action campaign in south africa told assembled reporters outside the venue , “ today ’ s donor conference was a scandal .
there were no meaningful pledges .
the wealthiest countries in the world are refusing the amounts of money needed in 2003 and 2004 to begin to save our lives . ” commenting on the speeches made by romano prodi , jacques chirac and kofi annan amongst others , dubula pointed out that funds have not been pledged , nor is there a timetable indicating when they may arrive . uphill battle for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv / aids antiretroviral drug kit .
scientists added to the calls for leaders to do more and to ensure that treatments were distributed to those who needed them .
professor christine katlama from the pitie-saltpetriere hospital in paris said , “ when we fight for aids , we fight for the world and all infected hiv patients . ” “ you can not ask the scientists to find new treatments and when they 've found treatments , they 're not available for 90 percent of patients .
no , they can not accept that millions will die and the silent people who die every day . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticized as aids donor conference opens prior to the start of an aids donor conference in paris wednesday , the german government is facing criticism that it wo n't contribute the funds needed to match america 's $ 1 billion pledge to the global aids fund .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .
germany is also expected to record a third year in the eu red - a scenario that could see both countries facing hefty fines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac ’ s call for softer pact creates uproar jacques chirac ’ s bastille day statement calling for temporary measures to relax the eu ’ s stability and growth pact has caused outrage among euro zone finance ministers .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .
business at the ready " we are not part of the coalition , but we are ready to improve the humanitarian situation .
our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .
the united states is currently discussing how to deal with the situation , powell said .

at the height of u.s.-german discord last autumn , rice described the relationship between the two countries as " poisoned . "
the tide has clearly turned in recent weeks . on wednesday fischer described berlin-washington ties as " excellent . "
but does that mean all is forgiven between berlin and washington ?
" it 's not about forgiveness or anything like that .
those are n't political categories , " fischer said .
instead , the pair spoke about bringing the strategic security debate between the u.s. and europe into gear .
previously during his visit , fischer called for further steps toward building up a new iraqi government . in an interview earlier this week with the u.s. public broadcaster pbs , fischer said the newly appointed governing council in iraq was a " step in the right direction .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .
business at the ready " we are not part of the coalition , but we are ready to improve the humanitarian situation .
our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .
the united states is currently discussing how to deal with the situation , powell said .

at the height of u.s.-german discord last autumn , rice described the relationship between the two countries as " poisoned . "
the tide has clearly turned in recent weeks . on wednesday fischer described berlin-washington ties as " excellent . "
but does that mean all is forgiven between berlin and washington ?
" it 's not about forgiveness or anything like that .
those are n't political categories , " fischer said .
instead , the pair spoke about bringing the strategic security debate between the u.s. and europe into gear .
previously during his visit , fischer called for further steps toward building up a new iraqi government . in an interview earlier this week with the u.s. public broadcaster pbs , fischer said the newly appointed governing council in iraq was a " step in the right direction .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .
germany is also expected to record a third year in the eu red - a scenario that could see both countries facing hefty fines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac ’ s call for softer pact creates uproar jacques chirac ’ s bastille day statement calling for temporary measures to relax the eu ’ s stability and growth pact has caused outrage among euro zone finance ministers .

but some worry that the country 's once-insatiable auto market may soon be facing a glut . vw chairman bernd pischetsrieder said his company plans to invest around € 6 billion -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- in china over the next five years , including building a new factory with its first automation works joint-venture partner , and making improvements to two already exisiting facilities .
as a result , output will be raised to about 1.6 million vehicles a year from a current 80,000 by 2008 .
vw is making the move in the hopes of holding on to its market-leading position in china .
falling market share first-half year-on-year sales leapt 52 percent , but the company 's market share dropped to 34 percent from 40 percent .
the drop reflects the overall rapid growth of the chinese car market and the increasing threat of competition from local competitors .
" the market is outpacing our -lrb- production -rrb- increase , " michael wilkes , volkswagen 's china spokesman , said .
yet some analysts have warned that capacity may be outpacing demand , threatening a glut and possible price war that could hit margins hard .
china 's state statistical bureau warned last month that some 10,000 cars ended up sitting in warehouses in april and may - despite sales jumping due to the outbreak of the deadly sars virus , which scared people away from public transportation .
rivals afoot the expansion will be financed from the chinese joint ventures themselves .
vw , which is battling falling sales in its european markets , has invested € 3 billion euros in china so far and is by far the largest auto maker in the country .
but others are planning similar expansion projects , including rivals general motors and nissan motor corp. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen ceo bernd pischetsrieder , left , helps place the corner stone for a new factory in changchun on july 15 , 2003 .
the wolfsburg-based car manufacturer has already begun construction on a € 1 billion factory at its faw-volkswagen facilities in the northeast city of changchun -lrb- photo -rrb- , and will increase production capacity at an existing factory there .
at the same time , volkswagen 's venture in china 's commercial hub , shanghai volkswagen automotive , will raise output by 75 percent .

protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .
vuyiseka dubula from the treatment action campaign in south africa told assembled reporters outside the venue , “ today ’ s donor conference was a scandal .
there were no meaningful pledges .
the wealthiest countries in the world are refusing the amounts of money needed in 2003 and 2004 to begin to save our lives . ” commenting on the speeches made by romano prodi , jacques chirac and kofi annan amongst others , dubula pointed out that funds have not been pledged , nor is there a timetable indicating when they may arrive . uphill battle for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv / aids antiretroviral drug kit .

protesters outside were not convinced . the international conference to highlight the progress of the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis -lrb- tb -rrb- and malaria came to a close on wednesday with european commission president romano prodi committing personally a $ 1 billion -lrb- € 0.8 billion -rrb- contribution from europe for 2004 . " i am the guarantor for the one billion , " prodi said at the meeting 's closing in paris .
" but you must respect that the european union is a democracy of 15 sovereign states , and we don ’ t always agree on everything .
sometimes we work a little like the turtle in the fable : we may sometimes work slowly , but we can be trusted to reach our goals in the long run . ”
the paris conference , hosted by the french government , featured reports on progress made by countries receiving support from the fund , which was set up to attract , manage and distribute resources to reduce the spread of aids , tb and malaria around the world .
the objective of the conference was to highlight the on-going work of projects financed by the global fund and to drum up more money in the struggle to treat and contain the diseases .
42 million infected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for treatment in nigeria .
figures from the united nations show that around 20 million people have already died of aids-related while current estimates of those infected by the hiv / aids virus worldwide stand at approximately 42 million people .
of those , an estimated one-third are also infected with tb .
approximately 90 percent of people living with hiv die within a few months of becoming sick with tb if they do not receive proper treatment .
since its inception in 2002 , the global fund has approved grants worth $ 1.5 billion to more than 150 programs in 92 countries .
the funding goes towards providing medications that help prevent the transmission of hiv from mothers to infants and anti-retroviral treatment for more than half a million people living with hiv / aids as well as helping towards medical and educational support for an equal number of children orphaned by the disease .
the money will also be used in the detection and treatment of two million additional cases of tb , and deliver 20 million combination drug treatments for drug-resistant malaria .
but in the fight against three of the world ’ s most virulent and potentially deadly diseases , the conference clearly showed that funding must continue .
funding shortfall currently , the global fund has more projects and proposals on its desk than it can possibly finance , a difficult reality that has prompted the calls for larger donations .
the fund has stated that it would like to spend more than $ 6 billion on research and projects , but it has so far received only $ 4.7 billion in donations for 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president jacques chirac .
french president jacques chirac joined prodi in rallying europe to contribute , while also calling on the united states to allocate the same amount to the fund each year .
speaking to the 250-strong delegation of health and foreign affairs ministers , senior development officials , private sector executives and non-governmental organizations gathered for the special donor day , chirac said : “ i am convinced that this multilateral response expresses , better than any other , the ideal of solidarity and collective action that must impel us . ”
“ turning the tide of aids , tb and malaria is a priority second to none , ” united nations secretary general kofi annan said in his address in his address .
“ the fund is there to fill a specific and substantial gap to scale up by providing effective funding -lrb- to fight the three diseases -rrb- . ”
more action required outside the conference hall and further afield , many people were not so convinced . protesters called the final day a fiasco and were joined in voicing their frustration by a number of scientists .
many were scathing in their criticism of western governments for failing to provide significant new money despite the apparently optimistic talk from leaders inside .
vuyiseka dubula from the treatment action campaign in south africa told assembled reporters outside the venue , “ today ’ s donor conference was a scandal .
there were no meaningful pledges .
the wealthiest countries in the world are refusing the amounts of money needed in 2003 and 2004 to begin to save our lives . ” commenting on the speeches made by romano prodi , jacques chirac and kofi annan amongst others , dubula pointed out that funds have not been pledged , nor is there a timetable indicating when they may arrive . uphill battle for scientists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv / aids antiretroviral drug kit .
scientists added to the calls for leaders to do more and to ensure that treatments were distributed to those who needed them .
professor christine katlama from the pitie-saltpetriere hospital in paris said , “ when we fight for aids , we fight for the world and all infected hiv patients . ” “ you can not ask the scientists to find new treatments and when they 've found treatments , they 're not available for 90 percent of patients .
no , they can not accept that millions will die and the silent people who die every day . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany criticized as aids donor conference opens prior to the start of an aids donor conference in paris wednesday , the german government is facing criticism that it wo n't contribute the funds needed to match america 's $ 1 billion pledge to the global aids fund .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .

our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .
he conceded , however , that germany was not alone in demanding that the united nations be granted a stronger role in the rebuilding of iraq .
the united states is currently discussing how to deal with the situation , powell said .

in meetings with top u.s. officials , germany 's foreign minister offered humanitarian and economic aid toward the rebuilding of iraq , but repeated that no german soldiers will be sent there . german foreign minister joschka fischer will wrap up his four-day u.s. tour on thursday with a meeting with u.s. vice president dick cheney .
talk is expected to focus on the situation in iraq , but it will also likely touch on the middle east , afghanistan and iran .
these same issues were on the agenda when fischer met late wednesday with his u.s. counterpart , secretary of state colin powell , and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
germany makes an offer in his meeting with powell , fischer made it clear that because europeans and americans have a " joint interest " in stability in the region , germany would offer humanitarian and economic assistance toward the rebuilding of iraq .
but he stuck to his government 's line that the country would n't even consider sending soldiers unless there is a clear un mandate to do so .
" i think the relevant security council resolution 1483 -lrb- which provided a mandate for nations to send forces to bring stability to iraq after saddam hussein 's regime was ousted in april -rrb- made it quite clear that the responsibility on the ground is in the hands of the coalition , " fischer said following his meeting with powell .
business at the ready " we are not part of the coalition , but we are ready to improve the humanitarian situation .
our business community is ready to play its role in the reconstruction , if it is warranted and if we know more details about the reconstruction .
we are open to discuss what could be our role in the reconstruction , but our position linked to the question of sending military troops is unchanged , " fischer added .
for his part , powell said he had not specifically demanded that germany contribute to the iraq rebuilding process during the course of their meeting .
rather , he had given fischer an overview of the current situation in the region .
in addition , the two " friends " discussed the situation in afghanistan , the middle east peace process , iran and north korea .
powell : no resolution needed following the meeting , powell said he saw no grounds for a new un resolution that would involve further countries in the administration and the rebuilding of iraq .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .

following comments made by jacques chirac calling for a relaxation of the eu ’ s stability and growth pact , gerhard schröder has come out in apparent support of the french president ’ s remarks . german chancellor gerhard schröder added more fuel to the flames of the already blazing stability and growth pact row on wednesday by apparently siding with his french counterpart , jacques chirac .
schröder ’ s comments have expanded the controversy surrounding the french president ’ s remarks on the possible relaxation of rules that prevent euro zone governments having budget deficits greater than three percent of the size of their economy . at a news conference in berlin on wednesday , the chancellor stopped short of reiterating chirac ’ s call for a " relaxation " of the pact , but his praise certainly added significant political weight behind one of the french president ’ s main justifications for leniency - economic growth for europe at the expense of rigid controls on budget deficits . franco-german axis the french president caused outrage on monday when he called for temporary measures that would relax the pact .
chirac ’ s bastille day speech was seen by many euro zone finance ministers as a “ storming ” of the stability pact and a threat to the euro .
now , schröder – chirac ’ s partner in the powerful franco-german axis that dominates eu economics – has deepened the divisions by calling chirac 's comments " great and really very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder .
in reference to the french president ’ s comments on aiding growth through temporary measures , schröder said , " he made clear that the pact is called the stability and growth pact for a good reason .
everyone only ever talks about the stability pact . " do n't forget the growth " but it 's called the stability and growth pact .
and on that basis , it is possible and necessary - and i agree with chirac on this - to stimulate growth , " schröder said .
both schröder and chirac are trying to revive their stagnant economies by cutting taxes at home .
however , in the case of germany , the estimated € 15.6bn in shortfalls due to the tax reform are expected to lead to a further € 5bn in public spending , bringing total new borrowing in 2004 to just under € 29bn . the split within the eu over the pact now looks more serious with the leader of europe ’ s largest economy aligning himself with the man who has called for greater flexibility in interpreting the rules that underpin the euro .
until schröder spoke out on wednesday , the french president , who had been widely criticized for his comments , had stood alone . permanent shift or flattery ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ally or flatterer ?
with schröder on side , the combined political clout of france and germany , who together make up almost half of the eu ’ s economy , could tip the debate inside europe toward chirac 's idea of a temporary easing of the rules .
however , it ’ s yet to be ascertained whether schröder 's comments represent a permanent shift in germany 's position or if he is trying to flatter his close ally while others rally against him . france appears unmoved by the opposition voiced across the eu to its call for an easing of the rules .
finance minister francis mer admitted on tuesday that france expected to break the rules for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
france recorded a deficit of 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2002 and the government has forecast the shortfall may be as high as 3.6 percent this year .
germany is also expected to record a third year in the eu red - a scenario that could see both countries facing hefty fines . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chirac ’ s call for softer pact creates uproar jacques chirac ’ s bastille day statement calling for temporary measures to relax the eu ’ s stability and growth pact has caused outrage among euro zone finance ministers .

" the director was very contrite .
he was very candid .
he was very forthcoming .
and he accepted full responsibility , " said pat roberts , chairman of the senate intelligence committee , after a closed-door hearing .
it was the first time mr tenet faced questions since he took the blame for the inclusion of us president george w bush 's controversial claim in his state of the union speech that iraq was trying to buy uranium in africa .
the white house later said the allegations about uranium in the speech were questionable , and some documents used to assert the claim were found to be forged .
during the four-and-a-half-hour hearing , republicans pressed the cia director on why the suspect intelligence was still included in the president 's speech in january .
mr roberts said it was clear " there were mistakes made up and down the chain " .
he said the hearing reaffirmed his belief that " the handling of this was sloppy " .
democrats have blamed the white house and questioned whether someone there had knowingly included the dubious intelligence to hype mr bush 's case for war against iraq .
they said mr tenet had named white house officials who had sought to include the information in the speech , but the democrats declined to identify them because of the confidentiality of the proceedings .
after the hearing , mr tenet said only : " it was an uplifting experience . "
' accountability ' asked whether mr tenet should resign , mr roberts said : " i think he is doing a good job in the war against terrorism .
this is one error that he has admitted in terms of his responsibility .
but in my personal view i would say no . "
the panel 's top democrat , senator john rockefeller , said it was crucial that there was " accountability " over the affair .
" i think that responsibility has to be taken by a lot more than george tenet . "
democratic presidential hopeful senator john edwards told journalists before the meeting that the us president should not shift the blame for the mistake .
" the responsibility is not the cia 's , it is not anyone else 's , it is the president 's responsibility , " he said .

the £ 30m museum - the centrepiece of manchester 's cathedral quarter - already receives an annual £ 1m subsidy from the city 's funds .
urbis has failed to reach its target of 200,000 paying visitors in its first year , despite the massive influx of visitors last summer during the commonwealth games .
liberal democrats say the subsidy is " unacceptable " , but the council leader argues it is worth investing more cash in urbis .
in march the museum 's boss , elizabeth usher , stepped down , despite being in the job for just eight months .
simon ashley , leader of the liberal democrat opposition at manchester town hall , said the council should be spending its money on more important projects .
we would prefer to see the money spent improving our schools , cleaning our streets , and other issues that matter to the people of manchester simon ashley , liberal democrats " a £ 1.5m annual subsidy is unacceptable , " he told bbc news online .
" like most people , we would prefer to see the money spent improving our schools , cleaning our streets , and other issues that matter to the people of manchester . "
he added a " radical " solution is needed to end urbis ' woes , suggesting a new visitor 's centre for the city could be based at the museum .
but council leader richard leese said urbis had earned the extra investment .
" urbis is stunning , " he said .
" it represents the cutting edge spirit of manchester .
urbis is a vital marketing tool in the future promotion of manchester and it is well worth increasing our investment to further boost its work council leader richard leese " it is outstanding , futuristic and instantly recognisable .
and at the same time it fuses so well with our history and heritage .

the expansion over the second quarter - equivalent to 6.3 % growth over a full year - in the massive mainland economy is the lowest for the april-june period since 1992 .
but after a breakneck 9.9 % expansion in the first quarter of the year , the figure for the first half of 2003 is 8.2 % , well ahead of expectations and enviable by most countries ' standards .
the after-effects of the sars virus , which devastated travel and trade across asia , were evident in the services sector , which grew just 0.8 % .
the chinese government had rejected warnings of sars ' impact till late april , sparking criticism that it had unnecessarily hindered efforts to control the virus 's effects .
before the announcement earlier this month that china was finally sars-free , the epidemic killed more than 340 people and infected more than 5,300 .
the belated announcement saw much of the country grind to a near-standstill , with the number of people travelling down by almost a quarter .
" after entering april , because of the impact of sars , some industries were severally affected leading to a clear slowdown in economy growth , " national bureau of statistics chief economist yao jingyuan said in a statement .
the government is counting on continued growth to feed the demand for jobs in china as more and more workers are pushed out of work in market-oriented reforms .
but although exports are up a third and imports up 45 % , retail sales are still weak , causing some to fear the economy could overheat .

the expansion over the second quarter - equivalent to 6.3 % growth over a full year - in the massive mainland economy is the lowest for the april-june period since 1992 .
but after a breakneck 9.9 % expansion in the first quarter of the year , the figure for the first half of 2003 is 8.2 % , well ahead of expectations and enviable by most countries ' standards .
the after-effects of the sars virus , which devastated travel and trade across asia , were evident in the services sector , which grew just 0.8 % .
the chinese government had rejected warnings of sars ' impact till late april , sparking criticism that it had unnecessarily hindered efforts to control the virus 's effects .
before the announcement earlier this month that china was finally sars-free , the epidemic killed more than 340 people and infected more than 5,300 .
the belated announcement saw much of the country grind to a near-standstill , with the number of people travelling down by almost a quarter .
" after entering april , because of the impact of sars , some industries were severally affected leading to a clear slowdown in economy growth , " national bureau of statistics chief economist yao jingyuan said in a statement .
the government is counting on continued growth to feed the demand for jobs in china as more and more workers are pushed out of work in market-oriented reforms .
but although exports are up a third and imports up 45 % , retail sales are still weak , causing some to fear the economy could overheat .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- yahoo japan heads for big list bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies thursday , 17 july , 2003 , 07:02 gmt 08:02 uk yahoo japan heads for big list yahoo japan , the leader in japanese fast internet access , is applying to move its shares onto the main market for japanese stocks and off the tech startups list .
the company announced its intention to switch to the first section of the tokyo stock exchange as it announced quarterly profits of more than double the figure for last year .
if successful , the move could open up yahoo japan 's stock to more big investors , which often prefer to buy shares available on the tse first section because of its more stringent listing requirements .
as well as operating one of japan 's most popular internet portals , yahoo japan is the country 's biggest provider of adsl broadband internet connections - although dominant telco ntt is working hard to catch up .
both companies have close to 3 million as long as all ntt units are counted together .
but ntt is now hoping a tie-up with disney will help it pull ahead in a nation where the obsession with mickey mouse and other cartoon characters approaches religious levels .
making the switch yahoo japan is 42 % owned by internet services company softbank japan , whose shares slipped ahead of the results along with those of yahoo japan itself , with another 33.5 % held by us parent yahoo corp. the company 's decision to switch to the tse first section comes as standard & poor 's , the global credit rating agency which also runs international stock indices , said it would add yahoo japan to its broadest japanese index once the market closes on thursday .
yahoo japan 's value by market capitalisation is up 170 % over the past year to 1.86 trillion yen -lrb- $ 15.7bn ; £ 9.8bn -rrb- , qualifying it to join the s & p japan 500 , s & p said in a statement .
yahoo japan 's healthy profits - 4.54bn yen -lrb- $ 38.4m ; £ 24m -rrb- , up 108 % for the april-june period over last year 's results - reflect wildfire growth in the popularity of its auction services .
the company also has a hammerlock on the habit of using the internet to make phone calls , especially popular in japan due to expensive phone tariffs .
its lead in this area could benefit from a recent government decision to allow ntt to boost its rates by 5 % , although its competitors are challenging the decision in the courts .
