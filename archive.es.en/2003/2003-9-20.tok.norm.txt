diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .
cleric says iran must quit npt a leading iranian cleric said on friday iran should consider quitting the npt after the iaea set an ultimatum for iran to prove it is not developing nuclear weapons .
ayatollah ahmad jannati , head of the powerful guardian council , said the iaea resolution was an " extraordinary humiliation " and called on the tehran government to reject it .
" what is wrong with not accepting this -lsb- npt -rsb- treaty .
north korea pulled out of it and many countries have never entered it , " jannati told worshippers during prayers at tehran university .
iran ’ s conservatives regard the international inspections of its nuclear facilities as tantamount to allowing spies into the country and should be refused .
the reformist government of president mohammad khatami , however , has said it will continue to negotiate with the iaea and will not pull out of the npt .
on august 18 , khatami wrote an open letter to european leaders , including eu president italy , pledging that iran would not divert its civilian nuclear program for military purposes .
but european leaders wonder if the reformist , who is locked into a power struggle with hardline clerics , actually has effective control over the nuclear program . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge . when leipzig was selected in april as germany ’ s best hope for hosting the summer olympics in 2012 , thousands of people took to the streets in celebration .
the mid-size city in the former east germany beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart and was catapulted into the international spotlight .
the unassuming olympic hopeful found itself lined up against stiff competition from the likes of the world metropolises london , paris and new york .
even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .
germany has sought to refurbish its olympic image since then , but the country has had seven unsuccessful bids , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin under the banner of a unified germany .
leipzig is hoping to achieve what the german capital has not and is playing up on the reunification theme as part of the city ’ s unique dynamic and image the rest of the world can latch on to as a focal point .

in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge . when leipzig was selected in april as germany ’ s best hope for hosting the summer olympics in 2012 , thousands of people took to the streets in celebration .
the mid-size city in the former east germany beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart and was catapulted into the international spotlight .
the unassuming olympic hopeful found itself lined up against stiff competition from the likes of the world metropolises london , paris and new york .
even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .
germany has sought to refurbish its olympic image since then , but the country has had seven unsuccessful bids , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin under the banner of a unified germany .
leipzig is hoping to achieve what the german capital has not and is playing up on the reunification theme as part of the city ’ s unique dynamic and image the rest of the world can latch on to as a focal point .
tiefensee is certain the lesser-known german city stands a good chance in hosting the games : " we have perfect conditions , and we have a story to tell .

in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .
germany has sought to refurbish its olympic image since then , but the country has had seven unsuccessful bids , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin under the banner of a unified germany .
leipzig is hoping to achieve what the german capital has not and is playing up on the reunification theme as part of the city ’ s unique dynamic and image the rest of the world can latch on to as a focal point .
tiefensee is certain the lesser-known german city stands a good chance in hosting the games : " we have perfect conditions , and we have a story to tell .

despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise . the high-profile gathering in the german capital represents a first cautious attempt for the leaders of germany , france and britain to find common ground on iraq-related foreign policy issues and heal europe ’ s diplomatic wounds , which split open over support for the u.s.-led war in iraq .
germany and france , as the two chief european nations opposed to the war , have forged a new sense of unity in the months following the u.s. invasion and have argued that the united nations should be at the center of rebuilding efforts in iraq and that its prime aim must be to place control of the country back in the hands of the people .
the two countries have repeatedly called for an accelerated timetable for the hand-over of power to the iraqis , something washington is hesitant to concede .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated this position only two days earlier during their ministerial meeting in berlin , when chirac said a transfer of power to the iraqi civilian authorities needed to happen not " within years , but months . "
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , the third participant in saturday ’ s berlin round of talks , sat on the opposite end of the table on saturday .
as one of washington ’ s staunchest supporters in the iraq war , britain fought alongside the u.s. and remains in the country as an occupying power .
although he certainly was not the odd-man in europe - spain and italy also endorsed the iraq war - blair was widely regarded as the chief opponent to the french-german axis in the european union .
now at the first tri-lateral meeting between the three countries since the iraq war , blair aspired to narrow the gap between his country and germany and france .
at a news conference after the two-hour talks blair told reporters , " we all want to see a stable iraq .
we all want to see iraq make a transition to democratic government as swiftly as possible .
we all want to see , and know there must be , a key role for the united nations . "
he added that he was convinced " whatever differences there are , they can be resolved . "
going into the meeting , no one really expected the removal of all differences over the iraq war and complete agreement on the reconstruction process .
british foreign secretary jack straw remarked ahead of the talks that friendships were not about the absence of differences , but rather about learning how to deal with them .
the question for saturday was to what extent the three leaders would be willing to move on their positions for the sake of harmony .
differences remain the berlin summit comes as washington prepares to draw up a u.n. resolution aimed at a broader sharing of the financial and military burden of iraq ’ s reconstruction .
france and germany have proposed changes to the u.s. draft calling for a greater u.n. role and a faster transfer of power to iraqi civilian authorities .
britain , for its part , has been hesitant to stray far from the united states on iraq and has largely followed washington ’ s course in resisting a rushed transfer of power .
on saturday blair ’ s reluctance to move forward on the issue was evident in chirac ’ s statements to the press emphasizing france ’ s position that there needed to be a rapid transfer of sovereignty to the iraqi people within months .
" our views are not quite convergent at the moment , " the french president said .
" on the technicalities and timetable , we are still not fully agreed , " he said , adding that the united nations must play a much bigger role .
shröder nodded in agreement , saying there was still a " need for discussions . "
prepared to compromise at the same time schröder and chirac have expressed their willingness to compromise on the reconstruction of iraq .
the german chancellor said in an article published friday in the new york times that germany is ready to help rebuild the war-torn nation .
" germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , " schröder said .
however , he stipulated that the united nations must play " a central role " in the process .
chirac , too , has said his country would be willing to help train new iraqi police officers and military personnel if germany went ahead with its offer to do the same .
" we share the same vision and preoccupations about iraq -lsb- as germany -rsb- and the need to evolve toward the stabilization and recovery of this country , " the french leader said in paris on friday .
harmony tops the agenda for all three leaders , compromise and harmony were the key focus of the meeting .
blair , who was upbeat about the talks said , " it is in everyone 's interest that we reach agreement and i believe that we will . "
germany and france want to " make clear that they are ready to keep talking to reach an agreement on a u.n. resolution in the coming weeks or months , " frank umback , security analyst at the german council on foreign relations , told reuters .
for germany , saturday ’ s summit and the attempts to reach a compromise underline the government ’ s eagerness to mend transatlantic ties after it fell out with washington last year over criticism of the war .
next wednesday chancellor schröder will have his first face-to-face talks with u.s. president george w. bush in nearly 18 months .
schröder ’ s coordinator on german-u.s. relations , karsten voigt , said the talks with france and britain could help transatlantic relations by fostering european unity .
" we want a europe that is strong so that it ’ s taken seriously as a partner by the united states , so that we have influence in washington , " he told reuters .
javier solana , the eu ’ s high representative for foreign policy , echoed that thinking in an interview with the german newspaper die welt on saturday .
he said that he was certain a u.n. resolution would be reached very soon and that saturday ’ s talks would give an important boost to establishing a common eu foreign policy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de left out : aznar and berlusconi excluded from summit though the prime ministers of spain and italy have played down the idea that their exclusion from saturday ’ s franco-german-british summit is a snub , leading newspapers in both countries say that ’ s exactly what it is -lrb- sept .

despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise . the high-profile gathering in the german capital represents a first cautious attempt for the leaders of germany , france and britain to find common ground on iraq-related foreign policy issues and heal europe ’ s diplomatic wounds , which split open over support for the u.s.-led war in iraq .
germany and france , as the two chief european nations opposed to the war , have forged a new sense of unity in the months following the u.s. invasion and have argued that the united nations should be at the center of rebuilding efforts in iraq and that its prime aim must be to place control of the country back in the hands of the people .
the two countries have repeatedly called for an accelerated timetable for the hand-over of power to the iraqis , something washington is hesitant to concede .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated this position only two days earlier during their ministerial meeting in berlin , when chirac said a transfer of power to the iraqi civilian authorities needed to happen not " within years , but months . "
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , the third participant in saturday ’ s berlin round of talks , sat on the opposite end of the table on saturday .
as one of washington ’ s staunchest supporters in the iraq war , britain fought alongside the u.s. and remains in the country as an occupying power .
although he certainly was not the odd-man in europe - spain and italy also endorsed the iraq war - blair was widely regarded as the chief opponent to the french-german axis in the european union .
now at the first tri-lateral meeting between the three countries since the iraq war , blair aspired to narrow the gap between his country and germany and france .
at a news conference after the two-hour talks blair told reporters , " we all want to see a stable iraq .
we all want to see iraq make a transition to democratic government as swiftly as possible .
we all want to see , and know there must be , a key role for the united nations . "
he added that he was convinced " whatever differences there are , they can be resolved . "
going into the meeting , no one really expected the removal of all differences over the iraq war and complete agreement on the reconstruction process .
british foreign secretary jack straw remarked ahead of the talks that friendships were not about the absence of differences , but rather about learning how to deal with them .
the question for saturday was to what extent the three leaders would be willing to move on their positions for the sake of harmony .
differences remain the berlin summit comes as washington prepares to draw up a u.n. resolution aimed at a broader sharing of the financial and military burden of iraq ’ s reconstruction .
france and germany have proposed changes to the u.s. draft calling for a greater u.n. role and a faster transfer of power to iraqi civilian authorities .
britain , for its part , has been hesitant to stray far from the united states on iraq and has largely followed washington ’ s course in resisting a rushed transfer of power .
on saturday blair ’ s reluctance to move forward on the issue was evident in chirac ’ s statements to the press emphasizing france ’ s position that there needed to be a rapid transfer of sovereignty to the iraqi people within months .
" our views are not quite convergent at the moment , " the french president said .
" on the technicalities and timetable , we are still not fully agreed , " he said , adding that the united nations must play a much bigger role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.09.2003 europe ’ s big three defy u.s. over iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as head of the iaea , mohamed el baradei will be taking a close look at iran .
diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .
cleric says iran must quit npt a leading iranian cleric said on friday iran should consider quitting the npt after the iaea set an ultimatum for iran to prove it is not developing nuclear weapons .
ayatollah ahmad jannati , head of the powerful guardian council , said the iaea resolution was an " extraordinary humiliation " and called on the tehran government to reject it .
" what is wrong with not accepting this -lsb- npt -rsb- treaty .
north korea pulled out of it and many countries have never entered it , " jannati told worshippers during prayers at tehran university .
iran ’ s conservatives regard the international inspections of its nuclear facilities as tantamount to allowing spies into the country and should be refused .

diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .

despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise . the high-profile gathering in the german capital represents a first cautious attempt for the leaders of germany , france and britain to find common ground on iraq-related foreign policy issues and heal europe ’ s diplomatic wounds , which split open over support for the u.s.-led war in iraq .
germany and france , as the two chief european nations opposed to the war , have forged a new sense of unity in the months following the u.s. invasion and have argued that the united nations should be at the center of rebuilding efforts in iraq and that its prime aim must be to place control of the country back in the hands of the people .
the two countries have repeatedly called for an accelerated timetable for the hand-over of power to the iraqis , something washington is hesitant to concede .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated this position only two days earlier during their ministerial meeting in berlin , when chirac said a transfer of power to the iraqi civilian authorities needed to happen not " within years , but months . "
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , the third participant in saturday ’ s berlin round of talks , sat on the opposite end of the table on saturday .
as one of washington ’ s staunchest supporters in the iraq war , britain fought alongside the u.s. and remains in the country as an occupying power .
although he certainly was not the odd-man in europe - spain and italy also endorsed the iraq war - blair was widely regarded as the chief opponent to the french-german axis in the european union .
now at the first tri-lateral meeting between the three countries since the iraq war , blair aspired to narrow the gap between his country and germany and france .
at a news conference after the two-hour talks blair told reporters , " we all want to see a stable iraq .
we all want to see iraq make a transition to democratic government as swiftly as possible .
we all want to see , and know there must be , a key role for the united nations . "
he added that he was convinced " whatever differences there are , they can be resolved . "
going into the meeting , no one really expected the removal of all differences over the iraq war and complete agreement on the reconstruction process .
british foreign secretary jack straw remarked ahead of the talks that friendships were not about the absence of differences , but rather about learning how to deal with them .
the question for saturday was to what extent the three leaders would be willing to move on their positions for the sake of harmony .
differences remain the berlin summit comes as washington prepares to draw up a u.n. resolution aimed at a broader sharing of the financial and military burden of iraq ’ s reconstruction .
france and germany have proposed changes to the u.s. draft calling for a greater u.n. role and a faster transfer of power to iraqi civilian authorities .
britain , for its part , has been hesitant to stray far from the united states on iraq and has largely followed washington ’ s course in resisting a rushed transfer of power .
on saturday blair ’ s reluctance to move forward on the issue was evident in chirac ’ s statements to the press emphasizing france ’ s position that there needed to be a rapid transfer of sovereignty to the iraqi people within months .
" our views are not quite convergent at the moment , " the french president said .
" on the technicalities and timetable , we are still not fully agreed , " he said , adding that the united nations must play a much bigger role .
shröder nodded in agreement , saying there was still a " need for discussions . "
prepared to compromise at the same time schröder and chirac have expressed their willingness to compromise on the reconstruction of iraq .
the german chancellor said in an article published friday in the new york times that germany is ready to help rebuild the war-torn nation .
" germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , " schröder said .
however , he stipulated that the united nations must play " a central role " in the process .
chirac , too , has said his country would be willing to help train new iraqi police officers and military personnel if germany went ahead with its offer to do the same .
" we share the same vision and preoccupations about iraq -lsb- as germany -rsb- and the need to evolve toward the stabilization and recovery of this country , " the french leader said in paris on friday .
harmony tops the agenda for all three leaders , compromise and harmony were the key focus of the meeting .
blair , who was upbeat about the talks said , " it is in everyone 's interest that we reach agreement and i believe that we will . "
germany and france want to " make clear that they are ready to keep talking to reach an agreement on a u.n. resolution in the coming weeks or months , " frank umback , security analyst at the german council on foreign relations , told reuters .
for germany , saturday ’ s summit and the attempts to reach a compromise underline the government ’ s eagerness to mend transatlantic ties after it fell out with washington last year over criticism of the war .
next wednesday chancellor schröder will have his first face-to-face talks with u.s. president george w. bush in nearly 18 months .
schröder ’ s coordinator on german-u.s. relations , karsten voigt , said the talks with france and britain could help transatlantic relations by fostering european unity .
" we want a europe that is strong so that it ’ s taken seriously as a partner by the united states , so that we have influence in washington , " he told reuters .
javier solana , the eu ’ s high representative for foreign policy , echoed that thinking in an interview with the german newspaper die welt on saturday .
he said that he was certain a u.n. resolution would be reached very soon and that saturday ’ s talks would give an important boost to establishing a common eu foreign policy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de left out : aznar and berlusconi excluded from summit though the prime ministers of spain and italy have played down the idea that their exclusion from saturday ’ s franco-german-british summit is a snub , leading newspapers in both countries say that ’ s exactly what it is -lrb- sept .

diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .

iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .
cleric says iran must quit npt a leading iranian cleric said on friday iran should consider quitting the npt after the iaea set an ultimatum for iran to prove it is not developing nuclear weapons .
ayatollah ahmad jannati , head of the powerful guardian council , said the iaea resolution was an " extraordinary humiliation " and called on the tehran government to reject it .

in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge . when leipzig was selected in april as germany ’ s best hope for hosting the summer olympics in 2012 , thousands of people took to the streets in celebration .
the mid-size city in the former east germany beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart and was catapulted into the international spotlight .
the unassuming olympic hopeful found itself lined up against stiff competition from the likes of the world metropolises london , paris and new york .
even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .
germany has sought to refurbish its olympic image since then , but the country has had seven unsuccessful bids , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin under the banner of a unified germany .
leipzig is hoping to achieve what the german capital has not and is playing up on the reunification theme as part of the city ’ s unique dynamic and image the rest of the world can latch on to as a focal point .
tiefensee is certain the lesser-known german city stands a good chance in hosting the games : " we have perfect conditions , and we have a story to tell .

in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge . when leipzig was selected in april as germany ’ s best hope for hosting the summer olympics in 2012 , thousands of people took to the streets in celebration .
the mid-size city in the former east germany beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart and was catapulted into the international spotlight .
the unassuming olympic hopeful found itself lined up against stiff competition from the likes of the world metropolises london , paris and new york .
even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .
germany has sought to refurbish its olympic image since then , but the country has had seven unsuccessful bids , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin under the banner of a unified germany .
leipzig is hoping to achieve what the german capital has not and is playing up on the reunification theme as part of the city ’ s unique dynamic and image the rest of the world can latch on to as a focal point .

despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise . the high-profile gathering in the german capital represents a first cautious attempt for the leaders of germany , france and britain to find common ground on iraq-related foreign policy issues and heal europe ’ s diplomatic wounds , which split open over support for the u.s.-led war in iraq .
germany and france , as the two chief european nations opposed to the war , have forged a new sense of unity in the months following the u.s. invasion and have argued that the united nations should be at the center of rebuilding efforts in iraq and that its prime aim must be to place control of the country back in the hands of the people .
the two countries have repeatedly called for an accelerated timetable for the hand-over of power to the iraqis , something washington is hesitant to concede .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated this position only two days earlier during their ministerial meeting in berlin , when chirac said a transfer of power to the iraqi civilian authorities needed to happen not " within years , but months . "
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , the third participant in saturday ’ s berlin round of talks , sat on the opposite end of the table on saturday .
as one of washington ’ s staunchest supporters in the iraq war , britain fought alongside the u.s. and remains in the country as an occupying power .
although he certainly was not the odd-man in europe - spain and italy also endorsed the iraq war - blair was widely regarded as the chief opponent to the french-german axis in the european union .
now at the first tri-lateral meeting between the three countries since the iraq war , blair aspired to narrow the gap between his country and germany and france .
at a news conference after the two-hour talks blair told reporters , " we all want to see a stable iraq .
we all want to see iraq make a transition to democratic government as swiftly as possible .
we all want to see , and know there must be , a key role for the united nations . "
he added that he was convinced " whatever differences there are , they can be resolved . "
going into the meeting , no one really expected the removal of all differences over the iraq war and complete agreement on the reconstruction process .
british foreign secretary jack straw remarked ahead of the talks that friendships were not about the absence of differences , but rather about learning how to deal with them .
the question for saturday was to what extent the three leaders would be willing to move on their positions for the sake of harmony .
differences remain the berlin summit comes as washington prepares to draw up a u.n. resolution aimed at a broader sharing of the financial and military burden of iraq ’ s reconstruction .
france and germany have proposed changes to the u.s. draft calling for a greater u.n. role and a faster transfer of power to iraqi civilian authorities .
britain , for its part , has been hesitant to stray far from the united states on iraq and has largely followed washington ’ s course in resisting a rushed transfer of power .
on saturday blair ’ s reluctance to move forward on the issue was evident in chirac ’ s statements to the press emphasizing france ’ s position that there needed to be a rapid transfer of sovereignty to the iraqi people within months .
" our views are not quite convergent at the moment , " the french president said .
" on the technicalities and timetable , we are still not fully agreed , " he said , adding that the united nations must play a much bigger role .
shröder nodded in agreement , saying there was still a " need for discussions . "
prepared to compromise at the same time schröder and chirac have expressed their willingness to compromise on the reconstruction of iraq .
the german chancellor said in an article published friday in the new york times that germany is ready to help rebuild the war-torn nation .
" germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , " schröder said .
however , he stipulated that the united nations must play " a central role " in the process .
chirac , too , has said his country would be willing to help train new iraqi police officers and military personnel if germany went ahead with its offer to do the same .
" we share the same vision and preoccupations about iraq -lsb- as germany -rsb- and the need to evolve toward the stabilization and recovery of this country , " the french leader said in paris on friday .
harmony tops the agenda for all three leaders , compromise and harmony were the key focus of the meeting .
blair , who was upbeat about the talks said , " it is in everyone 's interest that we reach agreement and i believe that we will . "
germany and france want to " make clear that they are ready to keep talking to reach an agreement on a u.n. resolution in the coming weeks or months , " frank umback , security analyst at the german council on foreign relations , told reuters .
for germany , saturday ’ s summit and the attempts to reach a compromise underline the government ’ s eagerness to mend transatlantic ties after it fell out with washington last year over criticism of the war .
next wednesday chancellor schröder will have his first face-to-face talks with u.s. president george w. bush in nearly 18 months .
schröder ’ s coordinator on german-u.s. relations , karsten voigt , said the talks with france and britain could help transatlantic relations by fostering european unity .
" we want a europe that is strong so that it ’ s taken seriously as a partner by the united states , so that we have influence in washington , " he told reuters .
javier solana , the eu ’ s high representative for foreign policy , echoed that thinking in an interview with the german newspaper die welt on saturday .

even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .
germany has sought to refurbish its olympic image since then , but the country has had seven unsuccessful bids , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin under the banner of a unified germany .
leipzig is hoping to achieve what the german capital has not and is playing up on the reunification theme as part of the city ’ s unique dynamic and image the rest of the world can latch on to as a focal point .
tiefensee is certain the lesser-known german city stands a good chance in hosting the games : " we have perfect conditions , and we have a story to tell .

despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise . the high-profile gathering in the german capital represents a first cautious attempt for the leaders of germany , france and britain to find common ground on iraq-related foreign policy issues and heal europe ’ s diplomatic wounds , which split open over support for the u.s.-led war in iraq .
germany and france , as the two chief european nations opposed to the war , have forged a new sense of unity in the months following the u.s. invasion and have argued that the united nations should be at the center of rebuilding efforts in iraq and that its prime aim must be to place control of the country back in the hands of the people .
the two countries have repeatedly called for an accelerated timetable for the hand-over of power to the iraqis , something washington is hesitant to concede .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated this position only two days earlier during their ministerial meeting in berlin , when chirac said a transfer of power to the iraqi civilian authorities needed to happen not " within years , but months . "
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , the third participant in saturday ’ s berlin round of talks , sat on the opposite end of the table on saturday .
as one of washington ’ s staunchest supporters in the iraq war , britain fought alongside the u.s. and remains in the country as an occupying power .
although he certainly was not the odd-man in europe - spain and italy also endorsed the iraq war - blair was widely regarded as the chief opponent to the french-german axis in the european union .
now at the first tri-lateral meeting between the three countries since the iraq war , blair aspired to narrow the gap between his country and germany and france .
at a news conference after the two-hour talks blair told reporters , " we all want to see a stable iraq .
we all want to see iraq make a transition to democratic government as swiftly as possible .
we all want to see , and know there must be , a key role for the united nations . "
he added that he was convinced " whatever differences there are , they can be resolved . "
going into the meeting , no one really expected the removal of all differences over the iraq war and complete agreement on the reconstruction process .
british foreign secretary jack straw remarked ahead of the talks that friendships were not about the absence of differences , but rather about learning how to deal with them .
the question for saturday was to what extent the three leaders would be willing to move on their positions for the sake of harmony .
differences remain the berlin summit comes as washington prepares to draw up a u.n. resolution aimed at a broader sharing of the financial and military burden of iraq ’ s reconstruction .
france and germany have proposed changes to the u.s. draft calling for a greater u.n. role and a faster transfer of power to iraqi civilian authorities .
britain , for its part , has been hesitant to stray far from the united states on iraq and has largely followed washington ’ s course in resisting a rushed transfer of power .
on saturday blair ’ s reluctance to move forward on the issue was evident in chirac ’ s statements to the press emphasizing france ’ s position that there needed to be a rapid transfer of sovereignty to the iraqi people within months .
" our views are not quite convergent at the moment , " the french president said .
" on the technicalities and timetable , we are still not fully agreed , " he said , adding that the united nations must play a much bigger role .
shröder nodded in agreement , saying there was still a " need for discussions . "
prepared to compromise at the same time schröder and chirac have expressed their willingness to compromise on the reconstruction of iraq .
the german chancellor said in an article published friday in the new york times that germany is ready to help rebuild the war-torn nation .
" germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , " schröder said .
however , he stipulated that the united nations must play " a central role " in the process .
chirac , too , has said his country would be willing to help train new iraqi police officers and military personnel if germany went ahead with its offer to do the same .
" we share the same vision and preoccupations about iraq -lsb- as germany -rsb- and the need to evolve toward the stabilization and recovery of this country , " the french leader said in paris on friday .
harmony tops the agenda for all three leaders , compromise and harmony were the key focus of the meeting .
blair , who was upbeat about the talks said , " it is in everyone 's interest that we reach agreement and i believe that we will . "
germany and france want to " make clear that they are ready to keep talking to reach an agreement on a u.n. resolution in the coming weeks or months , " frank umback , security analyst at the german council on foreign relations , told reuters .
for germany , saturday ’ s summit and the attempts to reach a compromise underline the government ’ s eagerness to mend transatlantic ties after it fell out with washington last year over criticism of the war .
next wednesday chancellor schröder will have his first face-to-face talks with u.s. president george w. bush in nearly 18 months .
schröder ’ s coordinator on german-u.s. relations , karsten voigt , said the talks with france and britain could help transatlantic relations by fostering european unity .
" we want a europe that is strong so that it ’ s taken seriously as a partner by the united states , so that we have influence in washington , " he told reuters .
javier solana , the eu ’ s high representative for foreign policy , echoed that thinking in an interview with the german newspaper die welt on saturday .
he said that he was certain a u.n. resolution would be reached very soon and that saturday ’ s talks would give an important boost to establishing a common eu foreign policy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de left out : aznar and berlusconi excluded from summit though the prime ministers of spain and italy have played down the idea that their exclusion from saturday ’ s franco-german-british summit is a snub , leading newspapers in both countries say that ’ s exactly what it is -lrb- sept .

diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .
cleric says iran must quit npt a leading iranian cleric said on friday iran should consider quitting the npt after the iaea set an ultimatum for iran to prove it is not developing nuclear weapons .
ayatollah ahmad jannati , head of the powerful guardian council , said the iaea resolution was an " extraordinary humiliation " and called on the tehran government to reject it .
" what is wrong with not accepting this -lsb- npt -rsb- treaty .
north korea pulled out of it and many countries have never entered it , " jannati told worshippers during prayers at tehran university .
iran ’ s conservatives regard the international inspections of its nuclear facilities as tantamount to allowing spies into the country and should be refused .
the reformist government of president mohammad khatami , however , has said it will continue to negotiate with the iaea and will not pull out of the npt .
on august 18 , khatami wrote an open letter to european leaders , including eu president italy , pledging that iran would not divert its civilian nuclear program for military purposes .
but european leaders wonder if the reformist , who is locked into a power struggle with hardline clerics , actually has effective control over the nuclear program . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise . the high-profile gathering in the german capital represents a first cautious attempt for the leaders of germany , france and britain to find common ground on iraq-related foreign policy issues and heal europe ’ s diplomatic wounds , which split open over support for the u.s.-led war in iraq .
germany and france , as the two chief european nations opposed to the war , have forged a new sense of unity in the months following the u.s. invasion and have argued that the united nations should be at the center of rebuilding efforts in iraq and that its prime aim must be to place control of the country back in the hands of the people .
the two countries have repeatedly called for an accelerated timetable for the hand-over of power to the iraqis , something washington is hesitant to concede .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated this position only two days earlier during their ministerial meeting in berlin , when chirac said a transfer of power to the iraqi civilian authorities needed to happen not " within years , but months . "
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , the third participant in saturday ’ s berlin round of talks , sat on the opposite end of the table on saturday .
as one of washington ’ s staunchest supporters in the iraq war , britain fought alongside the u.s. and remains in the country as an occupying power .
although he certainly was not the odd-man in europe - spain and italy also endorsed the iraq war - blair was widely regarded as the chief opponent to the french-german axis in the european union .
now at the first tri-lateral meeting between the three countries since the iraq war , blair aspired to narrow the gap between his country and germany and france .
at a news conference after the two-hour talks blair told reporters , " we all want to see a stable iraq .
we all want to see iraq make a transition to democratic government as swiftly as possible .
we all want to see , and know there must be , a key role for the united nations . "
he added that he was convinced " whatever differences there are , they can be resolved . "
going into the meeting , no one really expected the removal of all differences over the iraq war and complete agreement on the reconstruction process .
british foreign secretary jack straw remarked ahead of the talks that friendships were not about the absence of differences , but rather about learning how to deal with them .
the question for saturday was to what extent the three leaders would be willing to move on their positions for the sake of harmony .
differences remain the berlin summit comes as washington prepares to draw up a u.n. resolution aimed at a broader sharing of the financial and military burden of iraq ’ s reconstruction .
france and germany have proposed changes to the u.s. draft calling for a greater u.n. role and a faster transfer of power to iraqi civilian authorities .
britain , for its part , has been hesitant to stray far from the united states on iraq and has largely followed washington ’ s course in resisting a rushed transfer of power .
on saturday blair ’ s reluctance to move forward on the issue was evident in chirac ’ s statements to the press emphasizing france ’ s position that there needed to be a rapid transfer of sovereignty to the iraqi people within months .
" our views are not quite convergent at the moment , " the french president said .
" on the technicalities and timetable , we are still not fully agreed , " he said , adding that the united nations must play a much bigger role .
shröder nodded in agreement , saying there was still a " need for discussions . "
prepared to compromise at the same time schröder and chirac have expressed their willingness to compromise on the reconstruction of iraq .
the german chancellor said in an article published friday in the new york times that germany is ready to help rebuild the war-torn nation .
" germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , " schröder said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 20.09.2003 leipzig : a david among the olympian goliaths ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a charming downtown , but does leipzig have the prestige to host the olympics ?
in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge . when leipzig was selected in april as germany ’ s best hope for hosting the summer olympics in 2012 , thousands of people took to the streets in celebration .
the mid-size city in the former east germany beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart and was catapulted into the international spotlight .
the unassuming olympic hopeful found itself lined up against stiff competition from the likes of the world metropolises london , paris and new york .
even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .
germany has sought to refurbish its olympic image since then , but the country has had seven unsuccessful bids , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin under the banner of a unified germany .
leipzig is hoping to achieve what the german capital has not and is playing up on the reunification theme as part of the city ’ s unique dynamic and image the rest of the world can latch on to as a focal point .
tiefensee is certain the lesser-known german city stands a good chance in hosting the games : " we have perfect conditions , and we have a story to tell .

in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge . when leipzig was selected in april as germany ’ s best hope for hosting the summer olympics in 2012 , thousands of people took to the streets in celebration .
the mid-size city in the former east germany beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart and was catapulted into the international spotlight .
the unassuming olympic hopeful found itself lined up against stiff competition from the likes of the world metropolises london , paris and new york .
even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .
germany has sought to refurbish its olympic image since then , but the country has had seven unsuccessful bids , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin under the banner of a unified germany .
leipzig is hoping to achieve what the german capital has not and is playing up on the reunification theme as part of the city ’ s unique dynamic and image the rest of the world can latch on to as a focal point .
tiefensee is certain the lesser-known german city stands a good chance in hosting the games : " we have perfect conditions , and we have a story to tell . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for leipzig , the olympic dream begins as the bids close on tuesday for the candidate cities vying to host the 2012 summer olympics , germany 's hope , leipzig , is outlining its plans to make itself as attractive as possible -lrb- july 15 , 2003 -rrb- .

the unassuming olympic hopeful found itself lined up against stiff competition from the likes of the world metropolises london , paris and new york .
even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .
germany has sought to refurbish its olympic image since then , but the country has had seven unsuccessful bids , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin under the banner of a unified germany .
leipzig is hoping to achieve what the german capital has not and is playing up on the reunification theme as part of the city ’ s unique dynamic and image the rest of the world can latch on to as a focal point .
tiefensee is certain the lesser-known german city stands a good chance in hosting the games : " we have perfect conditions , and we have a story to tell .

diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .
cleric says iran must quit npt a leading iranian cleric said on friday iran should consider quitting the npt after the iaea set an ultimatum for iran to prove it is not developing nuclear weapons .

" what is wrong with not accepting this -lsb- npt -rsb- treaty .
north korea pulled out of it and many countries have never entered it , " jannati told worshippers during prayers at tehran university .
iran ’ s conservatives regard the international inspections of its nuclear facilities as tantamount to allowing spies into the country and should be refused .
the reformist government of president mohammad khatami , however , has said it will continue to negotiate with the iaea and will not pull out of the npt .
on august 18 , khatami wrote an open letter to european leaders , including eu president italy , pledging that iran would not divert its civilian nuclear program for military purposes .

diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .

despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise . the high-profile gathering in the german capital represents a first cautious attempt for the leaders of germany , france and britain to find common ground on iraq-related foreign policy issues and heal europe ’ s diplomatic wounds , which split open over support for the u.s.-led war in iraq .
germany and france , as the two chief european nations opposed to the war , have forged a new sense of unity in the months following the u.s. invasion and have argued that the united nations should be at the center of rebuilding efforts in iraq and that its prime aim must be to place control of the country back in the hands of the people .
the two countries have repeatedly called for an accelerated timetable for the hand-over of power to the iraqis , something washington is hesitant to concede .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated this position only two days earlier during their ministerial meeting in berlin , when chirac said a transfer of power to the iraqi civilian authorities needed to happen not " within years , but months . "
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , the third participant in saturday ’ s berlin round of talks , sat on the opposite end of the table on saturday .
as one of washington ’ s staunchest supporters in the iraq war , britain fought alongside the u.s. and remains in the country as an occupying power .
although he certainly was not the odd-man in europe - spain and italy also endorsed the iraq war - blair was widely regarded as the chief opponent to the french-german axis in the european union .
now at the first tri-lateral meeting between the three countries since the iraq war , blair aspired to narrow the gap between his country and germany and france .
at a news conference after the two-hour talks blair told reporters , " we all want to see a stable iraq .
we all want to see iraq make a transition to democratic government as swiftly as possible .
we all want to see , and know there must be , a key role for the united nations . "
he added that he was convinced " whatever differences there are , they can be resolved . "
going into the meeting , no one really expected the removal of all differences over the iraq war and complete agreement on the reconstruction process .
british foreign secretary jack straw remarked ahead of the talks that friendships were not about the absence of differences , but rather about learning how to deal with them .
the question for saturday was to what extent the three leaders would be willing to move on their positions for the sake of harmony .
differences remain the berlin summit comes as washington prepares to draw up a u.n. resolution aimed at a broader sharing of the financial and military burden of iraq ’ s reconstruction .
france and germany have proposed changes to the u.s. draft calling for a greater u.n. role and a faster transfer of power to iraqi civilian authorities .
britain , for its part , has been hesitant to stray far from the united states on iraq and has largely followed washington ’ s course in resisting a rushed transfer of power .
on saturday blair ’ s reluctance to move forward on the issue was evident in chirac ’ s statements to the press emphasizing france ’ s position that there needed to be a rapid transfer of sovereignty to the iraqi people within months .
" our views are not quite convergent at the moment , " the french president said .
" on the technicalities and timetable , we are still not fully agreed , " he said , adding that the united nations must play a much bigger role .
shröder nodded in agreement , saying there was still a " need for discussions . "
prepared to compromise at the same time schröder and chirac have expressed their willingness to compromise on the reconstruction of iraq .
the german chancellor said in an article published friday in the new york times that germany is ready to help rebuild the war-torn nation .
" germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , " schröder said .
however , he stipulated that the united nations must play " a central role " in the process .
chirac , too , has said his country would be willing to help train new iraqi police officers and military personnel if germany went ahead with its offer to do the same .
" we share the same vision and preoccupations about iraq -lsb- as germany -rsb- and the need to evolve toward the stabilization and recovery of this country , " the french leader said in paris on friday .
harmony tops the agenda for all three leaders , compromise and harmony were the key focus of the meeting .
blair , who was upbeat about the talks said , " it is in everyone 's interest that we reach agreement and i believe that we will . "
germany and france want to " make clear that they are ready to keep talking to reach an agreement on a u.n. resolution in the coming weeks or months , " frank umback , security analyst at the german council on foreign relations , told reuters .
for germany , saturday ’ s summit and the attempts to reach a compromise underline the government ’ s eagerness to mend transatlantic ties after it fell out with washington last year over criticism of the war .
next wednesday chancellor schröder will have his first face-to-face talks with u.s. president george w. bush in nearly 18 months .
schröder ’ s coordinator on german-u.s. relations , karsten voigt , said the talks with france and britain could help transatlantic relations by fostering european unity .
" we want a europe that is strong so that it ’ s taken seriously as a partner by the united states , so that we have influence in washington , " he told reuters .
javier solana , the eu ’ s high representative for foreign policy , echoed that thinking in an interview with the german newspaper die welt on saturday .

in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge . when leipzig was selected in april as germany ’ s best hope for hosting the summer olympics in 2012 , thousands of people took to the streets in celebration .
the mid-size city in the former east germany beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart and was catapulted into the international spotlight .
the unassuming olympic hopeful found itself lined up against stiff competition from the likes of the world metropolises london , paris and new york .
even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .
germany has sought to refurbish its olympic image since then , but the country has had seven unsuccessful bids , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin under the banner of a unified germany .
leipzig is hoping to achieve what the german capital has not and is playing up on the reunification theme as part of the city ’ s unique dynamic and image the rest of the world can latch on to as a focal point .
tiefensee is certain the lesser-known german city stands a good chance in hosting the games : " we have perfect conditions , and we have a story to tell .

but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge . when leipzig was selected in april as germany ’ s best hope for hosting the summer olympics in 2012 , thousands of people took to the streets in celebration .
the mid-size city in the former east germany beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart and was catapulted into the international spotlight .
the unassuming olympic hopeful found itself lined up against stiff competition from the likes of the world metropolises london , paris and new york .
even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .
germany has sought to refurbish its olympic image since then , but the country has had seven unsuccessful bids , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin under the banner of a unified germany .
leipzig is hoping to achieve what the german capital has not and is playing up on the reunification theme as part of the city ’ s unique dynamic and image the rest of the world can latch on to as a focal point .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.09.2003 berlin summit scores high for attempt at compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair , schröder and chirac : europe 's triumvirate does n't always look in the same direction .
despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise . the high-profile gathering in the german capital represents a first cautious attempt for the leaders of germany , france and britain to find common ground on iraq-related foreign policy issues and heal europe ’ s diplomatic wounds , which split open over support for the u.s.-led war in iraq .
germany and france , as the two chief european nations opposed to the war , have forged a new sense of unity in the months following the u.s. invasion and have argued that the united nations should be at the center of rebuilding efforts in iraq and that its prime aim must be to place control of the country back in the hands of the people .
the two countries have repeatedly called for an accelerated timetable for the hand-over of power to the iraqis , something washington is hesitant to concede .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated this position only two days earlier during their ministerial meeting in berlin , when chirac said a transfer of power to the iraqi civilian authorities needed to happen not " within years , but months . "
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , the third participant in saturday ’ s berlin round of talks , sat on the opposite end of the table on saturday .
as one of washington ’ s staunchest supporters in the iraq war , britain fought alongside the u.s. and remains in the country as an occupying power .
although he certainly was not the odd-man in europe - spain and italy also endorsed the iraq war - blair was widely regarded as the chief opponent to the french-german axis in the european union .
now at the first tri-lateral meeting between the three countries since the iraq war , blair aspired to narrow the gap between his country and germany and france .
at a news conference after the two-hour talks blair told reporters , " we all want to see a stable iraq .
we all want to see iraq make a transition to democratic government as swiftly as possible .
we all want to see , and know there must be , a key role for the united nations . "
he added that he was convinced " whatever differences there are , they can be resolved . "
going into the meeting , no one really expected the removal of all differences over the iraq war and complete agreement on the reconstruction process .
british foreign secretary jack straw remarked ahead of the talks that friendships were not about the absence of differences , but rather about learning how to deal with them .
the question for saturday was to what extent the three leaders would be willing to move on their positions for the sake of harmony .
differences remain the berlin summit comes as washington prepares to draw up a u.n. resolution aimed at a broader sharing of the financial and military burden of iraq ’ s reconstruction .
france and germany have proposed changes to the u.s. draft calling for a greater u.n. role and a faster transfer of power to iraqi civilian authorities .
britain , for its part , has been hesitant to stray far from the united states on iraq and has largely followed washington ’ s course in resisting a rushed transfer of power .
on saturday blair ’ s reluctance to move forward on the issue was evident in chirac ’ s statements to the press emphasizing france ’ s position that there needed to be a rapid transfer of sovereignty to the iraqi people within months .
" our views are not quite convergent at the moment , " the french president said .
" on the technicalities and timetable , we are still not fully agreed , " he said , adding that the united nations must play a much bigger role .
shröder nodded in agreement , saying there was still a " need for discussions . "
prepared to compromise at the same time schröder and chirac have expressed their willingness to compromise on the reconstruction of iraq .
the german chancellor said in an article published friday in the new york times that germany is ready to help rebuild the war-torn nation .
" germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , " schröder said .
however , he stipulated that the united nations must play " a central role " in the process .
chirac , too , has said his country would be willing to help train new iraqi police officers and military personnel if germany went ahead with its offer to do the same .
" we share the same vision and preoccupations about iraq -lsb- as germany -rsb- and the need to evolve toward the stabilization and recovery of this country , " the french leader said in paris on friday .
harmony tops the agenda for all three leaders , compromise and harmony were the key focus of the meeting .
blair , who was upbeat about the talks said , " it is in everyone 's interest that we reach agreement and i believe that we will . "
germany and france want to " make clear that they are ready to keep talking to reach an agreement on a u.n. resolution in the coming weeks or months , " frank umback , security analyst at the german council on foreign relations , told reuters .
for germany , saturday ’ s summit and the attempts to reach a compromise underline the government ’ s eagerness to mend transatlantic ties after it fell out with washington last year over criticism of the war .
next wednesday chancellor schröder will have his first face-to-face talks with u.s. president george w. bush in nearly 18 months .
schröder ’ s coordinator on german-u.s. relations , karsten voigt , said the talks with france and britain could help transatlantic relations by fostering european unity .
" we want a europe that is strong so that it ’ s taken seriously as a partner by the united states , so that we have influence in washington , " he told reuters .
javier solana , the eu ’ s high representative for foreign policy , echoed that thinking in an interview with the german newspaper die welt on saturday .
he said that he was certain a u.n. resolution would be reached very soon and that saturday ’ s talks would give an important boost to establishing a common eu foreign policy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de left out : aznar and berlusconi excluded from summit though the prime ministers of spain and italy have played down the idea that their exclusion from saturday ’ s franco-german-british summit is a snub , leading newspapers in both countries say that ’ s exactly what it is -lrb- sept .
19 , 2003 -rrb- .
bush and schröder back on speaking terms gerhard schröder and george w. bush will meet next week for their first face-to-face discussions in over a year .
it ’ s hoped the meeting , and german offers of help , will help bury the acrimonious dispute over iraq -lrb- sept .

diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .
cleric says iran must quit npt a leading iranian cleric said on friday iran should consider quitting the npt after the iaea set an ultimatum for iran to prove it is not developing nuclear weapons .
ayatollah ahmad jannati , head of the powerful guardian council , said the iaea resolution was an " extraordinary humiliation " and called on the tehran government to reject it .
" what is wrong with not accepting this -lsb- npt -rsb- treaty .
north korea pulled out of it and many countries have never entered it , " jannati told worshippers during prayers at tehran university .
iran ’ s conservatives regard the international inspections of its nuclear facilities as tantamount to allowing spies into the country and should be refused .
the reformist government of president mohammad khatami , however , has said it will continue to negotiate with the iaea and will not pull out of the npt .
on august 18 , khatami wrote an open letter to european leaders , including eu president italy , pledging that iran would not divert its civilian nuclear program for military purposes .

diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .
cleric says iran must quit npt a leading iranian cleric said on friday iran should consider quitting the npt after the iaea set an ultimatum for iran to prove it is not developing nuclear weapons .
ayatollah ahmad jannati , head of the powerful guardian council , said the iaea resolution was an " extraordinary humiliation " and called on the tehran government to reject it .
" what is wrong with not accepting this -lsb- npt -rsb- treaty .
north korea pulled out of it and many countries have never entered it , " jannati told worshippers during prayers at tehran university .
iran ’ s conservatives regard the international inspections of its nuclear facilities as tantamount to allowing spies into the country and should be refused .
the reformist government of president mohammad khatami , however , has said it will continue to negotiate with the iaea and will not pull out of the npt .
on august 18 , khatami wrote an open letter to european leaders , including eu president italy , pledging that iran would not divert its civilian nuclear program for military purposes .
but european leaders wonder if the reformist , who is locked into a power struggle with hardline clerics , actually has effective control over the nuclear program . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise . the high-profile gathering in the german capital represents a first cautious attempt for the leaders of germany , france and britain to find common ground on iraq-related foreign policy issues and heal europe ’ s diplomatic wounds , which split open over support for the u.s.-led war in iraq .
germany and france , as the two chief european nations opposed to the war , have forged a new sense of unity in the months following the u.s. invasion and have argued that the united nations should be at the center of rebuilding efforts in iraq and that its prime aim must be to place control of the country back in the hands of the people .
the two countries have repeatedly called for an accelerated timetable for the hand-over of power to the iraqis , something washington is hesitant to concede .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated this position only two days earlier during their ministerial meeting in berlin , when chirac said a transfer of power to the iraqi civilian authorities needed to happen not " within years , but months . "
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , the third participant in saturday ’ s berlin round of talks , sat on the opposite end of the table on saturday .
as one of washington ’ s staunchest supporters in the iraq war , britain fought alongside the u.s. and remains in the country as an occupying power .
although he certainly was not the odd-man in europe - spain and italy also endorsed the iraq war - blair was widely regarded as the chief opponent to the french-german axis in the european union .
now at the first tri-lateral meeting between the three countries since the iraq war , blair aspired to narrow the gap between his country and germany and france .
at a news conference after the two-hour talks blair told reporters , " we all want to see a stable iraq .
we all want to see iraq make a transition to democratic government as swiftly as possible .
we all want to see , and know there must be , a key role for the united nations . "
he added that he was convinced " whatever differences there are , they can be resolved . "
going into the meeting , no one really expected the removal of all differences over the iraq war and complete agreement on the reconstruction process .
british foreign secretary jack straw remarked ahead of the talks that friendships were not about the absence of differences , but rather about learning how to deal with them .
the question for saturday was to what extent the three leaders would be willing to move on their positions for the sake of harmony .
differences remain the berlin summit comes as washington prepares to draw up a u.n. resolution aimed at a broader sharing of the financial and military burden of iraq ’ s reconstruction .
france and germany have proposed changes to the u.s. draft calling for a greater u.n. role and a faster transfer of power to iraqi civilian authorities .
britain , for its part , has been hesitant to stray far from the united states on iraq and has largely followed washington ’ s course in resisting a rushed transfer of power .
on saturday blair ’ s reluctance to move forward on the issue was evident in chirac ’ s statements to the press emphasizing france ’ s position that there needed to be a rapid transfer of sovereignty to the iraqi people within months .
" our views are not quite convergent at the moment , " the french president said .
" on the technicalities and timetable , we are still not fully agreed , " he said , adding that the united nations must play a much bigger role .
shröder nodded in agreement , saying there was still a " need for discussions . "
prepared to compromise at the same time schröder and chirac have expressed their willingness to compromise on the reconstruction of iraq .
the german chancellor said in an article published friday in the new york times that germany is ready to help rebuild the war-torn nation .
" germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , " schröder said .
however , he stipulated that the united nations must play " a central role " in the process .
chirac , too , has said his country would be willing to help train new iraqi police officers and military personnel if germany went ahead with its offer to do the same .
" we share the same vision and preoccupations about iraq -lsb- as germany -rsb- and the need to evolve toward the stabilization and recovery of this country , " the french leader said in paris on friday .
harmony tops the agenda for all three leaders , compromise and harmony were the key focus of the meeting .
blair , who was upbeat about the talks said , " it is in everyone 's interest that we reach agreement and i believe that we will . "
germany and france want to " make clear that they are ready to keep talking to reach an agreement on a u.n. resolution in the coming weeks or months , " frank umback , security analyst at the german council on foreign relations , told reuters .
for germany , saturday ’ s summit and the attempts to reach a compromise underline the government ’ s eagerness to mend transatlantic ties after it fell out with washington last year over criticism of the war .
next wednesday chancellor schröder will have his first face-to-face talks with u.s. president george w. bush in nearly 18 months .
schröder ’ s coordinator on german-u.s. relations , karsten voigt , said the talks with france and britain could help transatlantic relations by fostering european unity .
" we want a europe that is strong so that it ’ s taken seriously as a partner by the united states , so that we have influence in washington , " he told reuters .
javier solana , the eu ’ s high representative for foreign policy , echoed that thinking in an interview with the german newspaper die welt on saturday .
he said that he was certain a u.n. resolution would be reached very soon and that saturday ’ s talks would give an important boost to establishing a common eu foreign policy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de left out : aznar and berlusconi excluded from summit though the prime ministers of spain and italy have played down the idea that their exclusion from saturday ’ s franco-german-british summit is a snub , leading newspapers in both countries say that ’ s exactly what it is -lrb- sept .

germany and france , as the two chief european nations opposed to the war , have forged a new sense of unity in the months following the u.s. invasion and have argued that the united nations should be at the center of rebuilding efforts in iraq and that its prime aim must be to place control of the country back in the hands of the people .
the two countries have repeatedly called for an accelerated timetable for the hand-over of power to the iraqis , something washington is hesitant to concede .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated this position only two days earlier during their ministerial meeting in berlin , when chirac said a transfer of power to the iraqi civilian authorities needed to happen not " within years , but months . "
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , the third participant in saturday ’ s berlin round of talks , sat on the opposite end of the table on saturday .
as one of washington ’ s staunchest supporters in the iraq war , britain fought alongside the u.s. and remains in the country as an occupying power .
although he certainly was not the odd-man in europe - spain and italy also endorsed the iraq war - blair was widely regarded as the chief opponent to the french-german axis in the european union .
now at the first tri-lateral meeting between the three countries since the iraq war , blair aspired to narrow the gap between his country and germany and france .
at a news conference after the two-hour talks blair told reporters , " we all want to see a stable iraq .
we all want to see iraq make a transition to democratic government as swiftly as possible .
we all want to see , and know there must be , a key role for the united nations . "
he added that he was convinced " whatever differences there are , they can be resolved . "
going into the meeting , no one really expected the removal of all differences over the iraq war and complete agreement on the reconstruction process .
british foreign secretary jack straw remarked ahead of the talks that friendships were not about the absence of differences , but rather about learning how to deal with them .
the question for saturday was to what extent the three leaders would be willing to move on their positions for the sake of harmony .
differences remain the berlin summit comes as washington prepares to draw up a u.n. resolution aimed at a broader sharing of the financial and military burden of iraq ’ s reconstruction .
france and germany have proposed changes to the u.s. draft calling for a greater u.n. role and a faster transfer of power to iraqi civilian authorities .
britain , for its part , has been hesitant to stray far from the united states on iraq and has largely followed washington ’ s course in resisting a rushed transfer of power .
on saturday blair ’ s reluctance to move forward on the issue was evident in chirac ’ s statements to the press emphasizing france ’ s position that there needed to be a rapid transfer of sovereignty to the iraqi people within months .
" our views are not quite convergent at the moment , " the french president said .
" on the technicalities and timetable , we are still not fully agreed , " he said , adding that the united nations must play a much bigger role .
shröder nodded in agreement , saying there was still a " need for discussions . "
prepared to compromise at the same time schröder and chirac have expressed their willingness to compromise on the reconstruction of iraq .
the german chancellor said in an article published friday in the new york times that germany is ready to help rebuild the war-torn nation .
" germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , " schröder said .
however , he stipulated that the united nations must play " a central role " in the process .
chirac , too , has said his country would be willing to help train new iraqi police officers and military personnel if germany went ahead with its offer to do the same .
" we share the same vision and preoccupations about iraq -lsb- as germany -rsb- and the need to evolve toward the stabilization and recovery of this country , " the french leader said in paris on friday .
harmony tops the agenda for all three leaders , compromise and harmony were the key focus of the meeting .
blair , who was upbeat about the talks said , " it is in everyone 's interest that we reach agreement and i believe that we will . "
germany and france want to " make clear that they are ready to keep talking to reach an agreement on a u.n. resolution in the coming weeks or months , " frank umback , security analyst at the german council on foreign relations , told reuters .
for germany , saturday ’ s summit and the attempts to reach a compromise underline the government ’ s eagerness to mend transatlantic ties after it fell out with washington last year over criticism of the war .
next wednesday chancellor schröder will have his first face-to-face talks with u.s. president george w. bush in nearly 18 months .
schröder ’ s coordinator on german-u.s. relations , karsten voigt , said the talks with france and britain could help transatlantic relations by fostering european unity .
" we want a europe that is strong so that it ’ s taken seriously as a partner by the united states , so that we have influence in washington , " he told reuters .
javier solana , the eu ’ s high representative for foreign policy , echoed that thinking in an interview with the german newspaper die welt on saturday .
he said that he was certain a u.n. resolution would be reached very soon and that saturday ’ s talks would give an important boost to establishing a common eu foreign policy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de left out : aznar and berlusconi excluded from summit though the prime ministers of spain and italy have played down the idea that their exclusion from saturday ’ s franco-german-british summit is a snub , leading newspapers in both countries say that ’ s exactly what it is -lrb- sept .

diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .
cleric says iran must quit npt a leading iranian cleric said on friday iran should consider quitting the npt after the iaea set an ultimatum for iran to prove it is not developing nuclear weapons .
ayatollah ahmad jannati , head of the powerful guardian council , said the iaea resolution was an " extraordinary humiliation " and called on the tehran government to reject it .
" what is wrong with not accepting this -lsb- npt -rsb- treaty .
north korea pulled out of it and many countries have never entered it , " jannati told worshippers during prayers at tehran university .
iran ’ s conservatives regard the international inspections of its nuclear facilities as tantamount to allowing spies into the country and should be refused .
the reformist government of president mohammad khatami , however , has said it will continue to negotiate with the iaea and will not pull out of the npt .
on august 18 , khatami wrote an open letter to european leaders , including eu president italy , pledging that iran would not divert its civilian nuclear program for military purposes .

diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .
cleric says iran must quit npt a leading iranian cleric said on friday iran should consider quitting the npt after the iaea set an ultimatum for iran to prove it is not developing nuclear weapons .
ayatollah ahmad jannati , head of the powerful guardian council , said the iaea resolution was an " extraordinary humiliation " and called on the tehran government to reject it .
" what is wrong with not accepting this -lsb- npt -rsb- treaty .
north korea pulled out of it and many countries have never entered it , " jannati told worshippers during prayers at tehran university .
iran ’ s conservatives regard the international inspections of its nuclear facilities as tantamount to allowing spies into the country and should be refused .
the reformist government of president mohammad khatami , however , has said it will continue to negotiate with the iaea and will not pull out of the npt .
on august 18 , khatami wrote an open letter to european leaders , including eu president italy , pledging that iran would not divert its civilian nuclear program for military purposes .
but european leaders wonder if the reformist , who is locked into a power struggle with hardline clerics , actually has effective control over the nuclear program . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge . when leipzig was selected in april as germany ’ s best hope for hosting the summer olympics in 2012 , thousands of people took to the streets in celebration .
the mid-size city in the former east germany beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart and was catapulted into the international spotlight .
the unassuming olympic hopeful found itself lined up against stiff competition from the likes of the world metropolises london , paris and new york .
even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .
germany has sought to refurbish its olympic image since then , but the country has had seven unsuccessful bids , most recently campaigning to host the 2000 summer games in berlin under the banner of a unified germany .
leipzig is hoping to achieve what the german capital has not and is playing up on the reunification theme as part of the city ’ s unique dynamic and image the rest of the world can latch on to as a focal point .

in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge . when leipzig was selected in april as germany ’ s best hope for hosting the summer olympics in 2012 , thousands of people took to the streets in celebration .
the mid-size city in the former east germany beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart and was catapulted into the international spotlight .
the unassuming olympic hopeful found itself lined up against stiff competition from the likes of the world metropolises london , paris and new york .
even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "
and of course for sports enthusiasts , tiefensee says leipzig is famous for the several different athletic forms developed in the city : football , gymnastics and cycling -lrb- the exclusivity of such a claim may be a question of interpretation -rrb- .
" we have a very great passion for sports , " tiefensee claims .
" some 3,700 graduates from over 120 countries attended the city ’ s sports college , " and indeed many of former east germany ’ s olympic medallists trained in leipzig .
germany ’ s best chance ?
the last time germany hosted the summer olympics was in munich in 1972 , the year 11 israeli athletes died in a palestinian terrorist attack .

diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .
cleric says iran must quit npt a leading iranian cleric said on friday iran should consider quitting the npt after the iaea set an ultimatum for iran to prove it is not developing nuclear weapons .
ayatollah ahmad jannati , head of the powerful guardian council , said the iaea resolution was an " extraordinary humiliation " and called on the tehran government to reject it .
" what is wrong with not accepting this -lsb- npt -rsb- treaty .
north korea pulled out of it and many countries have never entered it , " jannati told worshippers during prayers at tehran university .
iran ’ s conservatives regard the international inspections of its nuclear facilities as tantamount to allowing spies into the country and should be refused .
the reformist government of president mohammad khatami , however , has said it will continue to negotiate with the iaea and will not pull out of the npt .
on august 18 , khatami wrote an open letter to european leaders , including eu president italy , pledging that iran would not divert its civilian nuclear program for military purposes .
but european leaders wonder if the reformist , who is locked into a power struggle with hardline clerics , actually has effective control over the nuclear program . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in the shadow of london , new york and istanbul , leipzig is easily overlooked as a contender for the 2012 summer olympics .
but according to the city ’ s mayor , it ’ s exactly the smallness that gives it a competitive edge . when leipzig was selected in april as germany ’ s best hope for hosting the summer olympics in 2012 , thousands of people took to the streets in celebration .
the mid-size city in the former east germany beat off competition from hamburg , düsseldorf , frankfurt and stuttgart and was catapulted into the international spotlight .
the unassuming olympic hopeful found itself lined up against stiff competition from the likes of the world metropolises london , paris and new york .
even istanbul and rio de janiero possess a certain world-renown and a heavy dose of exotic flare that goes beyond anything leipzig can offer .
but the city , the second-largest in saxony , isn ’ t letting size get it down .
in fact , it ’ s hoping its smallness will actually help it win the competition and bring the olympic flame to germany for the first time in more than 30 years .
according to leipzig ’ s mayor wolfgang tiefensee , leipzig ’ s compactness is its unique selling point .
all the olympic venues will take place in a very small area making travel between the different sporting events and organization quick and efficient .
leipzig is a david among goliaths , tiefensee told deutsche welle in an interview on the city ’ s chances for winning the games .
size is not everything the mayor is convinced " bigger is not better . "
in the future , he says , the international olympic committee will be looking for cities that can organize the best possible games at the lowest possible costs .
keeping the games in a compact area will help achieve this goal , tiefensee explains .
" we have worked out a very compact concept with 97 percent of the total medals awarded within a ten-kilometer radius . "
in addition , leipzig will focus on erecting temporary facilities rather than extensive long-term building projects , thus further helping to keep costs down .
culture is important too although leipzig doesn ’ t have the international appeal of its larger competitors , it is nonetheless trying to advertise its cultural history in the hopes it can win points in the ioc voting .
an official leipzig olympics web site points out that bach , mendelssohn and martin luther all have connections to leipzig , and that the city ’ s many churches and old buildings lend the city an old-world village-like charm .
in terms of recent history , leipzig is campaigning on the fact that it is the only city from the former eastern europe competing for the games , and it wants to establish the olympics as a part of its post-communist development .
tiefensee is bargaining on the fact that the ioc still remembers the peaceful revolution of 1989 which led to germany ’ s unification and started with peace marches and protests in leipzig .
" it was a starting point in changing the political way of the world , " the mayor swoons . " and this is something we can link with the olympic games . "

diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .
cleric says iran must quit npt a leading iranian cleric said on friday iran should consider quitting the npt after the iaea set an ultimatum for iran to prove it is not developing nuclear weapons .
ayatollah ahmad jannati , head of the powerful guardian council , said the iaea resolution was an " extraordinary humiliation " and called on the tehran government to reject it .
" what is wrong with not accepting this -lsb- npt -rsb- treaty .
north korea pulled out of it and many countries have never entered it , " jannati told worshippers during prayers at tehran university .
iran ’ s conservatives regard the international inspections of its nuclear facilities as tantamount to allowing spies into the country and should be refused .
the reformist government of president mohammad khatami , however , has said it will continue to negotiate with the iaea and will not pull out of the npt .
on august 18 , khatami wrote an open letter to european leaders , including eu president italy , pledging that iran would not divert its civilian nuclear program for military purposes .
but european leaders wonder if the reformist , who is locked into a power struggle with hardline clerics , actually has effective control over the nuclear program . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise . the high-profile gathering in the german capital represents a first cautious attempt for the leaders of germany , france and britain to find common ground on iraq-related foreign policy issues and heal europe ’ s diplomatic wounds , which split open over support for the u.s.-led war in iraq .
germany and france , as the two chief european nations opposed to the war , have forged a new sense of unity in the months following the u.s. invasion and have argued that the united nations should be at the center of rebuilding efforts in iraq and that its prime aim must be to place control of the country back in the hands of the people .
the two countries have repeatedly called for an accelerated timetable for the hand-over of power to the iraqis , something washington is hesitant to concede .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated this position only two days earlier during their ministerial meeting in berlin , when chirac said a transfer of power to the iraqi civilian authorities needed to happen not " within years , but months . "
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , the third participant in saturday ’ s berlin round of talks , sat on the opposite end of the table on saturday .
as one of washington ’ s staunchest supporters in the iraq war , britain fought alongside the u.s. and remains in the country as an occupying power .
although he certainly was not the odd-man in europe - spain and italy also endorsed the iraq war - blair was widely regarded as the chief opponent to the french-german axis in the european union .
now at the first tri-lateral meeting between the three countries since the iraq war , blair aspired to narrow the gap between his country and germany and france .
at a news conference after the two-hour talks blair told reporters , " we all want to see a stable iraq .
we all want to see iraq make a transition to democratic government as swiftly as possible .
we all want to see , and know there must be , a key role for the united nations . "
he added that he was convinced " whatever differences there are , they can be resolved . "
going into the meeting , no one really expected the removal of all differences over the iraq war and complete agreement on the reconstruction process .
british foreign secretary jack straw remarked ahead of the talks that friendships were not about the absence of differences , but rather about learning how to deal with them .
the question for saturday was to what extent the three leaders would be willing to move on their positions for the sake of harmony .
differences remain the berlin summit comes as washington prepares to draw up a u.n. resolution aimed at a broader sharing of the financial and military burden of iraq ’ s reconstruction .
france and germany have proposed changes to the u.s. draft calling for a greater u.n. role and a faster transfer of power to iraqi civilian authorities .
britain , for its part , has been hesitant to stray far from the united states on iraq and has largely followed washington ’ s course in resisting a rushed transfer of power .
on saturday blair ’ s reluctance to move forward on the issue was evident in chirac ’ s statements to the press emphasizing france ’ s position that there needed to be a rapid transfer of sovereignty to the iraqi people within months .
" our views are not quite convergent at the moment , " the french president said .
" on the technicalities and timetable , we are still not fully agreed , " he said , adding that the united nations must play a much bigger role .
shröder nodded in agreement , saying there was still a " need for discussions . "
prepared to compromise at the same time schröder and chirac have expressed their willingness to compromise on the reconstruction of iraq .
the german chancellor said in an article published friday in the new york times that germany is ready to help rebuild the war-torn nation .
" germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , " schröder said .
however , he stipulated that the united nations must play " a central role " in the process .
chirac , too , has said his country would be willing to help train new iraqi police officers and military personnel if germany went ahead with its offer to do the same .
" we share the same vision and preoccupations about iraq -lsb- as germany -rsb- and the need to evolve toward the stabilization and recovery of this country , " the french leader said in paris on friday .
harmony tops the agenda for all three leaders , compromise and harmony were the key focus of the meeting .
blair , who was upbeat about the talks said , " it is in everyone 's interest that we reach agreement and i believe that we will . "
germany and france want to " make clear that they are ready to keep talking to reach an agreement on a u.n. resolution in the coming weeks or months , " frank umback , security analyst at the german council on foreign relations , told reuters .
for germany , saturday ’ s summit and the attempts to reach a compromise underline the government ’ s eagerness to mend transatlantic ties after it fell out with washington last year over criticism of the war .
next wednesday chancellor schröder will have his first face-to-face talks with u.s. president george w. bush in nearly 18 months .
schröder ’ s coordinator on german-u.s. relations , karsten voigt , said the talks with france and britain could help transatlantic relations by fostering european unity .
" we want a europe that is strong so that it ’ s taken seriously as a partner by the united states , so that we have influence in washington , " he told reuters .
javier solana , the eu ’ s high representative for foreign policy , echoed that thinking in an interview with the german newspaper die welt on saturday .

on saturday blair ’ s reluctance to move forward on the issue was evident in chirac ’ s statements to the press emphasizing france ’ s position that there needed to be a rapid transfer of sovereignty to the iraqi people within months .
" our views are not quite convergent at the moment , " the french president said .
" on the technicalities and timetable , we are still not fully agreed , " he said , adding that the united nations must play a much bigger role .
shröder nodded in agreement , saying there was still a " need for discussions . "
prepared to compromise at the same time schröder and chirac have expressed their willingness to compromise on the reconstruction of iraq .
the german chancellor said in an article published friday in the new york times that germany is ready to help rebuild the war-torn nation .
" germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , " schröder said .
however , he stipulated that the united nations must play " a central role " in the process .
chirac , too , has said his country would be willing to help train new iraqi police officers and military personnel if germany went ahead with its offer to do the same .
" we share the same vision and preoccupations about iraq -lsb- as germany -rsb- and the need to evolve toward the stabilization and recovery of this country , " the french leader said in paris on friday .
harmony tops the agenda for all three leaders , compromise and harmony were the key focus of the meeting .
blair , who was upbeat about the talks said , " it is in everyone 's interest that we reach agreement and i believe that we will . "
germany and france want to " make clear that they are ready to keep talking to reach an agreement on a u.n. resolution in the coming weeks or months , " frank umback , security analyst at the german council on foreign relations , told reuters .
for germany , saturday ’ s summit and the attempts to reach a compromise underline the government ’ s eagerness to mend transatlantic ties after it fell out with washington last year over criticism of the war .
next wednesday chancellor schröder will have his first face-to-face talks with u.s. president george w. bush in nearly 18 months .
schröder ’ s coordinator on german-u.s. relations , karsten voigt , said the talks with france and britain could help transatlantic relations by fostering european unity .
" we want a europe that is strong so that it ’ s taken seriously as a partner by the united states , so that we have influence in washington , " he told reuters .
javier solana , the eu ’ s high representative for foreign policy , echoed that thinking in an interview with the german newspaper die welt on saturday .

despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise . the high-profile gathering in the german capital represents a first cautious attempt for the leaders of germany , france and britain to find common ground on iraq-related foreign policy issues and heal europe ’ s diplomatic wounds , which split open over support for the u.s.-led war in iraq .
germany and france , as the two chief european nations opposed to the war , have forged a new sense of unity in the months following the u.s. invasion and have argued that the united nations should be at the center of rebuilding efforts in iraq and that its prime aim must be to place control of the country back in the hands of the people .
the two countries have repeatedly called for an accelerated timetable for the hand-over of power to the iraqis , something washington is hesitant to concede .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder reiterated this position only two days earlier during their ministerial meeting in berlin , when chirac said a transfer of power to the iraqi civilian authorities needed to happen not " within years , but months . "
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , the third participant in saturday ’ s berlin round of talks , sat on the opposite end of the table on saturday .
as one of washington ’ s staunchest supporters in the iraq war , britain fought alongside the u.s. and remains in the country as an occupying power .
although he certainly was not the odd-man in europe - spain and italy also endorsed the iraq war - blair was widely regarded as the chief opponent to the french-german axis in the european union .
now at the first tri-lateral meeting between the three countries since the iraq war , blair aspired to narrow the gap between his country and germany and france .
at a news conference after the two-hour talks blair told reporters , " we all want to see a stable iraq .
we all want to see iraq make a transition to democratic government as swiftly as possible .
we all want to see , and know there must be , a key role for the united nations . "
he added that he was convinced " whatever differences there are , they can be resolved . "
going into the meeting , no one really expected the removal of all differences over the iraq war and complete agreement on the reconstruction process .
british foreign secretary jack straw remarked ahead of the talks that friendships were not about the absence of differences , but rather about learning how to deal with them .
the question for saturday was to what extent the three leaders would be willing to move on their positions for the sake of harmony .
differences remain the berlin summit comes as washington prepares to draw up a u.n. resolution aimed at a broader sharing of the financial and military burden of iraq ’ s reconstruction .

diplomats confirm germany , france and britain broke with the united states last month by offering iran technological cooperation in exchange for stopping its nuclear program and accepting tougher u.n. inspections . in the discussion over europe ’ s position on iraq , germany , france and britain diverge on several points .
but when it comes to iran and the question of the country ’ s nuclear program , the three european powerhouses line up side by side , much to the dismay of the united states which has come to rely on britain as its staunchest ally in europe and has pinpointed iran on its " axis of evil . "
on friday western diplomats confirmed that despite intense lobbying from washington , berlin , paris and london had sent a letter to tehran earlier in the month trying to persuade the iranian government to accept in-depth inspections of its nuclear facilities .
although sent prior to last week ’ s resolution by the international atomic energy association -lrb- iaea -rrb- calling for iran to answer all outstanding questions about its nuclear fuel enrichment program by october 31 , the essence of the letter remains unchanged , say the foreign ministries from the three countries .
according to sources at the iaea in vienna , the letter urged iran to agree to inspections by the united nations ’ nuclear watchdog and held out the prospect of technological cooperation on developing a civilian nuclear energy program should tehran sign , implement and ratify the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
such a european gesture goes against the united states ’ position on iran , which regards the country as a threat and sees its civilian nuclear program as a cover for developing weapons of mass destruction .
a carrot for nuclear deal although british officials have downplayed suggestions that iran had been offered a " quid pro quo , " something the u.s. government had adamantly rejected , the financial times says the letter highlights a widening gulf between european foreign policy which is committed to engagement with the islamic republic and the united states which is sticking to a course of isolation .
iaea officials familiar with the letter told reuters washington considered it " not very clever " and a mixed signal .
" they were worried it ran the risk of splitting europe and america on this issue , " the sources said , " and they attempted to dissuade them from sending the letter . "
a spokesman for the german foreign ministry denied offering iran a carrot in the letter and said german , french and british interests were reflected in the iaea resolution from last week .
the french foreign ministry told reporters the letter had merely requested iran to send a " clear signal " and sign the npt .
cleric says iran must quit npt a leading iranian cleric said on friday iran should consider quitting the npt after the iaea set an ultimatum for iran to prove it is not developing nuclear weapons .
ayatollah ahmad jannati , head of the powerful guardian council , said the iaea resolution was an " extraordinary humiliation " and called on the tehran government to reject it .
" what is wrong with not accepting this -lsb- npt -rsb- treaty .
north korea pulled out of it and many countries have never entered it , " jannati told worshippers during prayers at tehran university .
iran ’ s conservatives regard the international inspections of its nuclear facilities as tantamount to allowing spies into the country and should be refused .
the reformist government of president mohammad khatami , however , has said it will continue to negotiate with the iaea and will not pull out of the npt .
on august 18 , khatami wrote an open letter to european leaders , including eu president italy , pledging that iran would not divert its civilian nuclear program for military purposes .
but european leaders wonder if the reformist , who is locked into a power struggle with hardline clerics , actually has effective control over the nuclear program . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the fastap keypad does away with the need to press keys several times to scroll through the letters associated with each number .
intel 's prototype device rolls together mobile phone technology with wi-fi , video and audio streaming and improved security .
big partner fastap was developed by former apple ergonomic design boss david levy as a way to make it easier to enter text using the tiny keypad on a handset .
the design puts letters of the alphabet on raised buttons that fit between the keys .
words can be typed by pressing the raised keys , and numbers by pressing the four keys that surround a particular number .
intel is adapting the design for its concept gadget digit wireless , which licences use of the fastap technology , has signed deals with phone makers in the far east but intel is by far the largest technology firm to back the idea .
intel is relatively new to the handset chip market but has ambitions to become a significant provider of the hardware inside the handsets that we carry around .
intel has adapted the design for the concept universal communicator that was unveiled by intel boss paul ottelini at the developer forum that took place from 16-18 september .
the concept gadget crammed together many of the technologies intel believes consumers will look for in future smart phones .
mr ottelini said that intel had to adapt as smaller , smarter gadgets become popular with consumers .
he said it had to look into new ways to make chips to cram more into the small form factors becoming popular .

words can be typed by pressing the raised keys , and numbers by pressing the four keys that surround a particular number .
intel is adapting the design for its concept gadget digit wireless , which licences use of the fastap technology , has signed deals with phone makers in the far east but intel is by far the largest technology firm to back the idea .
intel is relatively new to the handset chip market but has ambitions to become a significant provider of the hardware inside the handsets that we carry around .
intel has adapted the design for the concept universal communicator that was unveiled by intel boss paul ottelini at the developer forum that took place from 16-18 september .
the concept gadget crammed together many of the technologies intel believes consumers will look for in future smart phones .
mr ottelini said that intel had to adapt as smaller , smarter gadgets become popular with consumers .
he said it had to look into new ways to make chips to cram more into the small form factors becoming popular .
the universal communicator is a mobile phone that also has onboard personal digital assistant functions , a video camera , several different wireless technologies and can stream audio and video to other devices .

mr koizumi , who has held the post for two and a half years , garnered 399 votes - 260 more than his closest rival .
he had been strongly favoured to defeat his three challengers - shizuka kamei , a senior party executive , takao fujii , a former transport minister , and masahiko komura , a former foreign minister .
the bbc 's jonathan head in tokyo says many conservative ldp members voted for him , against their deepest political instincts , realising that his charisma was an electoral asset .
mr kamei came second with 139 votes , followed by mr fujii with 65 and mr komura with 54 .
" this election comes at a time of great change for the party , " mr koizumi said as he accepted his second term as leader .
" this was an election to prove this party is the party of the people , and of promoting reforms . "
koizumi 's challengers shizuka kamei , 66 : former ldp policy chief ; favours revising pacifist constitution and more public spending masahiko komura , 61 : former foreign minister ; wants less austere fiscal stance takao fujii , 60 : former transport minister ; wants more public spending , but with better focus how the vote works mr koizumi is now expected to reshuffle his cabinet ahead of the next general election , likely to be held in november .
the ldp is the largest party in japan 's lower house , almost guaranteeing its leader the prime ministership .
our correspondent says mr koizumi 's flamboyant style and reformist agenda have unsettled the traditional party bosses .
he has faced criticism from some quarters for his slow progress in reviving the japanese economy .
but many hardline conservatives backed him because they regarded his public popularity as vital to win the next general election .
mr koizumi 's easy-going style has been on frequent display in recent weeks , from opening the pitching at a school baseball game to visiting many of the country 's hard-pressed industries .
under the election rules , the winner needed to win a majority of the 657 ballots available .
ldp mps cast 357 votes , while the other 300 were calculated to reflect the votes of the party 's 1.4m grass-roots members .

bob and sally dowler say they hope a safety charity set up in their daughter 's memory will help save the lives of other youngsters .
over the summer holidays , copies of a personal safety video called watch over me have been sent to every secondary school in the country .
and at those 7,000 schools , hundreds of thousands of teenagers will watch the film aimed at helping children to stay away from potential dangers .
bob and i were determined to turn the terrible tragedy which affected our family into something positive sally dowler , milly 's mother the film was made with the proceeds of milly 's fund - a charity set up in memory of 13-year-old amanda dowler , known as milly , who disappeared in march last year as she walked home from school in walton-on-thames in surrey .
since her remains were discovered in yateley heath woods in hampshire on 20 september last year , mr and mrs dowler have put all their energies into the project .
mrs dowler told bbc news online : " bob and i were determined to turn the terrible tragedy which affected our family into something positive , in order to help teenagers such as milly .
" she was a very sensible girl and we realised if such a thing could happen to her , then many other young people needed help and guidance on how to cope with the experiences every teenager faces .
' humour and fun ' " we decided the best approach was through schools but we did n't want to produce another worthy book on the subject of personal safety . "
instead the dowlers , who have another daughter , gemma , decided to commission a team to put together a series of lively , realistic dramas showing teenagers faced with everyday pressures .
" it 's no good telling teenagers do n't do this and do n't do that , " mr dowler said .
" they rarely respond to negative commands . "
the five-part soap opera features interviews with actors and teenagers " there is a lot of humour and fun there too , " said mrs dowler .
" we went to great lengths to research the scenarios used in the drama - speaking to thousands of pupils at schools across england and wales .
" what we found was that many young people think things will never happen to them ... just other people . "
first screened in front of the house of commons in june , the five-part soap opera features testimonies from teenagers and celebrities about the risks they have faced in their own lives .
forensic work among those to appear are television presenters ant and dec , cat deeley and davina mccall , as well as chris tarrant , the patron of milly 's fund .
milly 's parents hope the video , which was paid for by £ 100,000 from the fund and £ 75,000 each from the home office and department for education and skills , may prevent other young lives being cut short .
their daughter 's funeral was held a year to the day after she vanished .
mrs dowler said she hoped the family 's tragedy would help others meanwhile despite intensive police investigations - and a reward of £ 50,000 put up by surrey police and crimewatch - the murder remains unsolved .
a team of about 40 detectives involved in the operation ruby inquiry continues to sift through evidence in a major incident room in guildford .
officers believe a key piece of the puzzle could be the clothes and possessions milly had with her when she disappeared .
none of milly 's school uniform nor her school bag and its contents have ever been found .
a surrey police spokeswoman said : " there is still some forensic work going on , also things like looking at the names of people mentioned to us by other forces of potential interest to the inquiry .
" there 's also information given to us by members of the public - various sightings or individuals mentioned and names given to us .
" officers are going through witness accounts and trying to eliminate those people who may have been there at the time . "

in a rare public speech , prince bandar bin sultan bin abdul aziz told a foreign affairs forum in san francisco that saudi arabia had employed effective measures to counter the threat .
he also accused western media of giving the false impression that everyone in the kingdom supported al-qaeda leader osama bin laden , blamed for the 11 september 2001 attacks in new york and washington .
us-saudi relations have been tense since the discovery that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the 9/11 attacks were saudi nationals .
if you read the papers ... everybody and their mother -lrb- in saudi arabia -rrb- are bin laden supporters .
that 's not true prince bandar bin sultan bin abdul aziz saudi arabia has intensified its crackdown on islamist groups with suspected links to al-qaeda since a may car bombing in the capital riyadh , which left 35 people dead .
since the attack , scores of militants have been arrested and dozens of suspects have been killed in gunbattles with the saudi security forces .
but there is still concern in washington that saudi arabia is providing only limited co-operation in america 's war on terror , and that some saudi charities may still be funding organisations like al-qaeda .
' ugly things ' " if you read the papers ... everybody and their mother -lrb- in saudi arabia -rrb- are bin laden supporters .
that 's not true , " prince bandar told the gathering , organised by the world affairs council .
at least 35 people were killed in a bomb attack in riyadh in may " nine-eleven shook me to the roots , " he said , adding that the atrocities were also a wake-up call for the saudi government to rein in muslim radicals in the kingdom .
" the bad news is that we found some ugly things do exist .
the good news is that there was not really as much as you have been led to believe , " prince bandar said .
" i think we have taken enough steps that will be proven to be the right steps .
" we did n't do it to please the united states of america .
we did it because it violated the essence of our religion . "
' intellectual arrogance ' but in carefully measured remarks , prince bandar - who has served as saudi ambassador to the us since 1983 - also said washington 's desire to dominate world affairs brought risks of its own .
" i personally feel it 's not in america 's interest to be the only game in town , " he said .
" it costs money and no one says thank you . "
the ambassador said he detected what he described as " a little bit of intellectual arrogance " in the american belief that promoting democracy was a universal solution to the world 's problems .
" it did n't solve all your problems here , " he said .

in a rare public speech , prince bandar bin sultan bin abdul aziz told a foreign affairs forum in san francisco that saudi arabia had employed effective measures to counter the threat .
he also accused western media of giving the false impression that everyone in the kingdom supported al-qaeda leader osama bin laden , blamed for the 11 september 2001 attacks in new york and washington .
us-saudi relations have been tense since the discovery that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the 9/11 attacks were saudi nationals .
if you read the papers ... everybody and their mother -lrb- in saudi arabia -rrb- are bin laden supporters .
that 's not true prince bandar bin sultan bin abdul aziz saudi arabia has intensified its crackdown on islamist groups with suspected links to al-qaeda since a may car bombing in the capital riyadh , which left 35 people dead .
since the attack , scores of militants have been arrested and dozens of suspects have been killed in gunbattles with the saudi security forces .
but there is still concern in washington that saudi arabia is providing only limited co-operation in america 's war on terror , and that some saudi charities may still be funding organisations like al-qaeda .
' ugly things ' " if you read the papers ... everybody and their mother -lrb- in saudi arabia -rrb- are bin laden supporters .
that 's not true , " prince bandar told the gathering , organised by the world affairs council .
at least 35 people were killed in a bomb attack in riyadh in may " nine-eleven shook me to the roots , " he said , adding that the atrocities were also a wake-up call for the saudi government to rein in muslim radicals in the kingdom .
" the bad news is that we found some ugly things do exist .
the good news is that there was not really as much as you have been led to believe , " prince bandar said .
" i think we have taken enough steps that will be proven to be the right steps .
" we did n't do it to please the united states of america .
we did it because it violated the essence of our religion . "
' intellectual arrogance ' but in carefully measured remarks , prince bandar - who has served as saudi ambassador to the us since 1983 - also said washington 's desire to dominate world affairs brought risks of its own .

uk prime minister tony blair and french president jacques chirac are in talks with germany 's chancellor gerhard schroeder in berlin .
as well as iraq , the " informal " talks will also cover other issues such as eu enlargement , afghanistan and transatlantic relations .
mr blair is seeking to win french and german backing for a us-drafted resolution currently being discussed at the united nations , which is designed to pave the way for a multinational force in iraq .
germany and france have criticised the resolution - but have also suggested amendments , in a sign of compromise .
it seems the french are playing hardball while the germans would like to kiss and make up the bbc 's ray furlong iraq summit a test for europe france and germany were strong opponents of the war on iraq , while mr blair was us president george w bush 's closest ally .
the berlin meeting is the first time the three leaders have met for trilateral talks since before the war .
bbc correspondent ray furlong said there were also differences between the positions of france and germany on iraq .
' common positions ' at a franco-german summit earlier this week mr chirac stressed the need for power to be swiftly handed over in iraq , while mr schroeder remained silent on the issue , our correspondent said .
" it seems the french are playing hardball while the germans would like to kiss and make up , " he said .
berlin said in a statement this week the aim of the talks was to agree on " common positions " after the iraq war disagreements .
germany is hosting the three-way talks but british officials have sought to dampen hopes of anything concrete coming from the talks .
mr blair 's official spokesman said : " this kind of meeting is a discussion , this is not a formal summit .
" obviously iraq is an issue that will come up , but this is not intended to be a drafting session for the un resolution . "
flying visit mr blair will also want to seek support for changes britain has proposed to the draft eu constitutional treaty which will be discussed at an inter-governmental conference starting next month .
however , mr schroeder has already said he would be against changing the wording of the treaty .
it is a flying visit for mr blair , who is meeting spanish prime minister jose maria aznar at the prime minister 's chequers retreat for further talks on sunday .
