the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .
but the first all-european planetary exploration effort must overcome the bad luck that has plagued previous missions . the red planet has never been kind to scientists .
roughly two-thirds of the 30 missions to mars are considered failures .
officials from the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- hope their mars express probe will shake off the curse , so it can settle once and for all whether life exists , has existed , or ever can exist on earth ’ s neighbor . " we do not know what happened to the planet in the past .
which process turned mars into the dry , cold world we see today ? " said agustin chicarro , esa 's mars express project scientist , in a statement .
" with mars express , we will find out .
above all , we aim to obtain a complete global view of the planet - its history , its geology , how it has evolved .
real planetology ! " though space exploration has always been challenging , the stakes for the esa are particularly high .
europe ’ s aerospace industry is hoping to raise its profile amid stiff competition from the united states , russia , japan and even china . the mars express is only one of three missions taking off this month to take advantage of a period when earth and mars are at their closest point in 17 years .
the motto of the 300-million-euro mission is “ faster , smarter , and more cost-effective ” than any previous exploration of mars . more responsibility for private sector the mission also hopes to succeed by giving more responsibility to the 24 private technology companies that are taking part in the project . the mission will begin at roughly 7:45 pm central european time , when a russian soyuz rocket lifts off from the baikonur cosmodrome in the central asian republic of kazakhstan .
sitting atop the powerful rocket will be a planetary orbiter and a small , 65-kilogram british lander probe called the beagle 2 , in honor of the ship that carried charles darwin to the galapagos islands in 1831 . some time in december , the orbiter and the beagle will separate high above mars and a german control team in the city of darmstadt near frankfurt will guide the beagle to a controlled collision with the planet ’ s surface , somewhere in an area 300 kilometers long and 150 kilometers wide .
parachutes will slow the decent and air balloons encasing the probe will enable it to bounce to a cushioned landing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beagle 2 lander .
if all goes according to plan , the beagle will play a short , nine-note tune composed by the british pop group blur to alert mission control that the beagle has landed . over the following months it will explore the planet ’ s atmosphere , surface , and sub-surface .
the beagle will gather information both with a gas sniffing “ nose ” for analysis of the air and with a probe which will collect samples from as much as two meters below the surface of the planet . then if the mission ’ s luck holds , the beagle will relay its data to the orbiter , which will beam it back to earth for two years .
but that ’ s only if the red planet decides to be a little nicer to earth ’ s scientists . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space agency prepares for mars voyage with the planets aligning just right , the european space agency is moving forward with plans to launch the mars express in june – a precursor to manned missions to the red planet .

eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east . the strike comes after union members voted overwhelmingly on friday to down their tools after negotiations with employers broke down .
engineering trade union ig metall wants to see the weekly working hours of auto and metal industry workers in germany ’ s eastern states cut from 38 to the 35 currently required of workers in western germany .
" thirteen years after german reunification we need further steps to realize equal work and income conditions throughout germany , " said ig metall boss klaus zwickel on monday morning at a volkswagen plant in zwickau , south of dresden .
the strike could be the start of the largest labor unrest seen in germany since ig metall workers across the country left production lines last year in a pay dispute with employers .
some 12,000 workers from 15 different plants took part in monday ’ s strike .
eastern workers are expected to strike sporadically throughout the region until thursday and , if no agreement is reached , the work stoppages will be expanded next week .
around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east are employed in the engineering sector , which includes automakers such as volkswagen and bmw , as well as heavy industry like steel .
zwickel laments " fairness gap " zwickel has called the hours discrepancy between east and west a " fairness gap , " but employers and many economists point out that many eastern operations have a much lower productivity than their western counterparts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , dismissed the question of fairness in an interview on german radio .
" the only thing that ’ s fair is what helps us move germany forward , " rogowski told deutschlandfunk monday morning .
some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist east .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce .
the dispute also comes at bad moment for german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is attempting to push through unpopular reforms in the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and inflexible labor market .
unions have vehemently opposed schröder ’ s so-called " agenda 2010 " that aims to cut welfare benefits and loosen job-protection rules .
that opposition to reform has led many in germany to regard organized labor as a stumbling block to restructuring the country ’ s moribund economy .
by striking to cut their hours when many easterners are out of work , ig metall runs the risk of further isolating the unions from the public at large .
although ig metall says some 15,000 new jobs would be created by shortening the week by three hours , employers and others contend at least 20,000 would be lost by the increased labor costs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.06.2003 eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking steel workers hope to cut their hours from 38 to 35 a week .
eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east . the strike comes after union members voted overwhelmingly on friday to down their tools after negotiations with employers broke down .
engineering trade union ig metall wants to see the weekly working hours of auto and metal industry workers in germany ’ s eastern states cut from 38 to the 35 currently required of workers in western germany .
" thirteen years after german reunification we need further steps to realize equal work and income conditions throughout germany , " said ig metall boss klaus zwickel on monday morning at a volkswagen plant in zwickau , south of dresden .
the strike could be the start of the largest labor unrest seen in germany since ig metall workers across the country left production lines last year in a pay dispute with employers .
some 12,000 workers from 15 different plants took part in monday ’ s strike .
eastern workers are expected to strike sporadically throughout the region until thursday and , if no agreement is reached , the work stoppages will be expanded next week .
around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east are employed in the engineering sector , which includes automakers such as volkswagen and bmw , as well as heavy industry like steel .
zwickel laments " fairness gap " zwickel has called the hours discrepancy between east and west a " fairness gap , " but employers and many economists point out that many eastern operations have a much lower productivity than their western counterparts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , dismissed the question of fairness in an interview on german radio .
" the only thing that ’ s fair is what helps us move germany forward , " rogowski told deutschlandfunk monday morning .
some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist east .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce .
the dispute also comes at bad moment for german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is attempting to push through unpopular reforms in the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and inflexible labor market .
unions have vehemently opposed schröder ’ s so-called " agenda 2010 " that aims to cut welfare benefits and loosen job-protection rules .
that opposition to reform has led many in germany to regard organized labor as a stumbling block to restructuring the country ’ s moribund economy .
by striking to cut their hours when many easterners are out of work , ig metall runs the risk of further isolating the unions from the public at large .
although ig metall says some 15,000 new jobs would be created by shortening the week by three hours , employers and others contend at least 20,000 would be lost by the increased labor costs .
" what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " christian democrats party leader angela merkel told ard public television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise between unions and employers averts strike after 31 hours of difficult negotiations , trade union leaders and employers agreed on a pay deal for public sector workers , averting widespread strikes .
but german local authorities still foresee problems .
-lrb- january 11 , 2003 -rrb- ig metall strike yields 4 % pay increase germany 's engineering sector has ended a 10-day pay dispute in a settlement that is widely seen as a victory for the unions , although employers welcomed the longer-than-usual 22-month period over which it will be valid .

the troops will reinforce the current 700-strong lightly-armed u.n. force in the ituri region , where ethnic fighting has left more than 400 dead in recent weeks .
under the u.n. charter , the new troops , which will be in place until september 1 , 2003 , are authorized to use force to prevent widespread massacres , protect civilians and secure the nearby airport .
france is sending 800 to 1,000 soldiers , while belgium , spain , italy and britain are reported to consider contributing troops .
question marks over german participation the deployment of the emergency force , which the u.n. hopes will help avoid a repeat of massacres such as in rwanda and bosnia in the 1990s , has raised fresh questions about german military participation in international peacekeeping activities .
u.n. secretary general kofi anan requested the eu two weeks ago to put together an emergency peacekeeping force for congo .
the request came at a time when eu leaders were making final decisions on the formation of a rapid reaction force .
though eu foreign policy chief javier solana was eager to mark the beginning of the eu 's first military operation in africa , eu diplomats told reuters last week berlin was initially cool to anan ’ s request .
the german government is reported to have had misgivings about an eu operation in congo and argued that congo was too distant from europe , a tough military challenge and a conflict on which there was no agreed eu foreign policy .
but in an apparent change of stance foreign minister joschka fischer told solana at a g8 foreign ministers meeting in paris recently that germany would drop objections to the deployment of an eu peacekeeping force in eastern congo , but would not actively participate .
likewise , german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller , who has been touring the conflict-torn region , described german military involvement as " very difficult " .
speaking to reporters in uganda over the weekend , the minister said u.n. secretary-general anan wanted both france and germany to participate in peace operations .
" the force certainly merits every support , but we need to examine what ’ s possible within our capabilities , " she said adding that germany would politically support the peace mission and provide humanitarian help .
müller stressed that germany was already the second-largest troop-provider in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and in the balkans .
germany ’ s ambassador to the u.n. gunter pleuger last week also ruled out german troop participation .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans .
i don ’ t know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now , " he told reporters .
politicians in favor of military involvement however , leading politicians from germany ’ s main parties are urging germany to get involved in stopping the congolese bloodshed .
the ruling social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- defense expert verena wohlleben told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the deployment of an eu force under a u.n.-mandate was the " right way " .
her view was echoed by the green party ’ s deputy parliamentary leader winfried nachtwei .
" we must now quickly decide how the german military can contribute to the eu mission in the congo , " he told the paper .
foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- friedbert pflüger urged the german government to provide financial and logistical support to the congo mission , including the deployment of the mobile army hospital " medevac " .
even the liberal free democratic party ’ s -lrb- fdp -rrb- deputy chairman walter döring told the welt am sonntag paper that everything must be done to avoid a " second rwanda . "
" if the eu intervenes under a u.n. mandate , germany must send troops , " he said .

the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .
but the first all-european planetary exploration effort must overcome the bad luck that has plagued previous missions . the red planet has never been kind to scientists .
roughly two-thirds of the 30 missions to mars are considered failures .
officials from the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- hope their mars express probe will shake off the curse , so it can settle once and for all whether life exists , has existed , or ever can exist on earth ’ s neighbor . " we do not know what happened to the planet in the past .
which process turned mars into the dry , cold world we see today ? " said agustin chicarro , esa 's mars express project scientist , in a statement .
" with mars express , we will find out .
above all , we aim to obtain a complete global view of the planet - its history , its geology , how it has evolved .
real planetology ! " though space exploration has always been challenging , the stakes for the esa are particularly high .
europe ’ s aerospace industry is hoping to raise its profile amid stiff competition from the united states , russia , japan and even china . the mars express is only one of three missions taking off this month to take advantage of a period when earth and mars are at their closest point in 17 years .
the motto of the 300-million-euro mission is “ faster , smarter , and more cost-effective ” than any previous exploration of mars . more responsibility for private sector the mission also hopes to succeed by giving more responsibility to the 24 private technology companies that are taking part in the project . the mission will begin at roughly 7:45 pm central european time , when a russian soyuz rocket lifts off from the baikonur cosmodrome in the central asian republic of kazakhstan .
sitting atop the powerful rocket will be a planetary orbiter and a small , 65-kilogram british lander probe called the beagle 2 , in honor of the ship that carried charles darwin to the galapagos islands in 1831 . some time in december , the orbiter and the beagle will separate high above mars and a german control team in the city of darmstadt near frankfurt will guide the beagle to a controlled collision with the planet ’ s surface , somewhere in an area 300 kilometers long and 150 kilometers wide .
parachutes will slow the decent and air balloons encasing the probe will enable it to bounce to a cushioned landing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beagle 2 lander .
if all goes according to plan , the beagle will play a short , nine-note tune composed by the british pop group blur to alert mission control that the beagle has landed . over the following months it will explore the planet ’ s atmosphere , surface , and sub-surface .
the beagle will gather information both with a gas sniffing “ nose ” for analysis of the air and with a probe which will collect samples from as much as two meters below the surface of the planet . then if the mission ’ s luck holds , the beagle will relay its data to the orbiter , which will beam it back to earth for two years .

g8 leaders , including britain 's tony blair -lrb- l . -rrb- meet on sunday .
u.s. president bush forgave russia and largely ignored germany on his short stopover in evian .
though hundreds of protestors rioted in nearby switzerland , the g8 summit kicked off as planned . observers say there is a motto that some top washington officials go by when it comes to how to treat europe 's iraq war opponents : " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia . " with president george w. bush 's short trip through europe winding down with a one day visit to the alpine spa town of evian for the group of eight summit , it seems two of the three have so far occurred . at a celebration of st. petersburg 's 300th anniversary in petershof castle saturday evening , bush extended his hand and a curt " how are you , " to chancellor gerhard schröder , ending weeks of speculation in the german press on whether the two would press the flesh . " fine , " schröder reportedly responded , bringing the pleasantries to a close .
it was the last one-on-one between the two planned for this trip .
they will not meet privately at evian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush , left , leans in to talk to russian president vladimir putin , right prior to the start of their bilateral meeting at konstantin palace sunday , june 1 , 2003 in st. petersburg , russia .
president bush challenged allies saturday to overcome their bitterness and mistrust over the iraq war and unite in the struggle against terrorism .
bush and putin met privately and held a joint news conference before they travel to evian , france , for the annual summit of major industrialized nations .
-lrb- ap photo / j. scott applewhite -rrb- the sunday morning after the schröder-bush handshake , putin and bush appeared in front of journalists after a private morning discussion .
the two smiled and said they had swept aside their differences over iraq .
bush and putin also pressed north korea to give up their nuclear program . washington apparently made no inroads in stopping russia 's involvement in developing iran 's nuclear program .
questions on russia 's concerns about losing existing iraqi oil contracts were brushed aside . genetically-modified food dispute upon the u.s. president 's arrival in france , french president jacques chirac met bush and offered him a public , if stiff handshake .
the two will meet privately monday amid a g8 meeting that will cover issues ranging from sparking the slumping world economy to strengthening the middle east peace process . though bush has carried a message of reconciliation on this european trip , with stops in krakow , st. petersburg and evian , the eu and u.s. might clash over europe 's import ban on genetically-modified food . with an eye on both africa and their own farming industry , the bush administration has maintained that genetically-modified food , which can grow in adverse climates , is crucial to helping africa overcome its famine woes .
europe has refused to import such products because of fears of health and environmental risks . the meeting of the g8 , which includes the u.s. , the u.k. , germany , france , japan , russia , canada and italy , is due to end monday . protestors riot , march peacefully tens of thousands of protestors have made their presence felt ahead of the summit .

about 300 masked anti-globalisation activists started rioting in lausanne sunday morning , looting a gas station and setting on fire trash cans and construction boards .
demonstrators have gathered in lausanne and geneva over the last days to protest the g8 summit taking place in nearby evian , france , june 1 to june 3 .

police officers , out in force , fired tear gas cannisters , rubber bullets and water hoses to contain the black-hooded anarchists and globalization critics .
the protestors said the g8 were ignoring the plight of the world 's poor and smashed shop windows in rich towns like lausanne and geneva .
french and swiss police have set up a 15 km zone around the meeting headquarters to shut out demonstrators .
thousands of protestors managed to block the road between lausanne and the french border , which skirts geneva , but did n't hinder delegates on their way to the summit .

the troops will reinforce the current 700-strong lightly-armed u.n. force in the ituri region , where ethnic fighting has left more than 400 dead in recent weeks .
under the u.n. charter , the new troops , which will be in place until september 1 , 2003 , are authorized to use force to prevent widespread massacres , protect civilians and secure the nearby airport .
france is sending 800 to 1,000 soldiers , while belgium , spain , italy and britain are reported to consider contributing troops .
question marks over german participation the deployment of the emergency force , which the u.n. hopes will help avoid a repeat of massacres such as in rwanda and bosnia in the 1990s , has raised fresh questions about german military participation in international peacekeeping activities .
u.n. secretary general kofi anan requested the eu two weeks ago to put together an emergency peacekeeping force for congo .
the request came at a time when eu leaders were making final decisions on the formation of a rapid reaction force .
though eu foreign policy chief javier solana was eager to mark the beginning of the eu 's first military operation in africa , eu diplomats told reuters last week berlin was initially cool to anan ’ s request .
the german government is reported to have had misgivings about an eu operation in congo and argued that congo was too distant from europe , a tough military challenge and a conflict on which there was no agreed eu foreign policy .
but in an apparent change of stance foreign minister joschka fischer told solana at a g8 foreign ministers meeting in paris recently that germany would drop objections to the deployment of an eu peacekeeping force in eastern congo , but would not actively participate .
likewise , german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller , who has been touring the conflict-torn region , described german military involvement as " very difficult " .
speaking to reporters in uganda over the weekend , the minister said u.n. secretary-general anan wanted both france and germany to participate in peace operations .
" the force certainly merits every support , but we need to examine what ’ s possible within our capabilities , " she said adding that germany would politically support the peace mission and provide humanitarian help .
müller stressed that germany was already the second-largest troop-provider in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and in the balkans .
germany ’ s ambassador to the u.n. gunter pleuger last week also ruled out german troop participation .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans .
i don ’ t know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now , " he told reporters .
politicians in favor of military involvement however , leading politicians from germany ’ s main parties are urging germany to get involved in stopping the congolese bloodshed .
the ruling social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- defense expert verena wohlleben told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the deployment of an eu force under a u.n.-mandate was the " right way " .
her view was echoed by the green party ’ s deputy parliamentary leader winfried nachtwei .
" we must now quickly decide how the german military can contribute to the eu mission in the congo , " he told the paper .
foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- friedbert pflüger urged the german government to provide financial and logistical support to the congo mission , including the deployment of the mobile army hospital " medevac " .
even the liberal free democratic party ’ s -lrb- fdp -rrb- deputy chairman walter döring told the welt am sonntag paper that everything must be done to avoid a " second rwanda . "
" if the eu intervenes under a u.n. mandate , germany must send troops , " he said .
former bundeswehr general warns of dangers but despite the overwhelming support for german participation in the congo from across party lines , former german bundeswehr general klaus naumann has warned against dispatching eu troops to congo .
naumann told the welt am sonntag the northeast congo entails an entirely different situation as compared to the balkans and soldiers from europe are not prepared for it .

question marks over german participation the deployment of the emergency force , which the u.n. hopes will help avoid a repeat of massacres such as in rwanda and bosnia in the 1990s , has raised fresh questions about german military participation in international peacekeeping activities .
u.n. secretary general kofi anan requested the eu two weeks ago to put together an emergency peacekeeping force for congo .
the request came at a time when eu leaders were making final decisions on the formation of a rapid reaction force .
though eu foreign policy chief javier solana was eager to mark the beginning of the eu 's first military operation in africa , eu diplomats told reuters last week berlin was initially cool to anan ’ s request .
the german government is reported to have had misgivings about an eu operation in congo and argued that congo was too distant from europe , a tough military challenge and a conflict on which there was no agreed eu foreign policy .
but in an apparent change of stance foreign minister joschka fischer told solana at a g8 foreign ministers meeting in paris recently that germany would drop objections to the deployment of an eu peacekeeping force in eastern congo , but would not actively participate .
likewise , german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller , who has been touring the conflict-torn region , described german military involvement as " very difficult " .
speaking to reporters in uganda over the weekend , the minister said u.n. secretary-general anan wanted both france and germany to participate in peace operations .
" the force certainly merits every support , but we need to examine what ’ s possible within our capabilities , " she said adding that germany would politically support the peace mission and provide humanitarian help .
müller stressed that germany was already the second-largest troop-provider in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and in the balkans .
germany ’ s ambassador to the u.n. gunter pleuger last week also ruled out german troop participation .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans .
i don ’ t know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now , " he told reporters .
politicians in favor of military involvement however , leading politicians from germany ’ s main parties are urging germany to get involved in stopping the congolese bloodshed .
the ruling social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- defense expert verena wohlleben told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the deployment of an eu force under a u.n.-mandate was the " right way " .
her view was echoed by the green party ’ s deputy parliamentary leader winfried nachtwei .
" we must now quickly decide how the german military can contribute to the eu mission in the congo , " he told the paper .
foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- friedbert pflüger urged the german government to provide financial and logistical support to the congo mission , including the deployment of the mobile army hospital " medevac " .
even the liberal free democratic party ’ s -lrb- fdp -rrb- deputy chairman walter döring told the welt am sonntag paper that everything must be done to avoid a " second rwanda . "
" if the eu intervenes under a u.n. mandate , germany must send troops , " he said .
former bundeswehr general warns of dangers but despite the overwhelming support for german participation in the congo from across party lines , former german bundeswehr general klaus naumann has warned against dispatching eu troops to congo .
naumann told the welt am sonntag the northeast congo entails an entirely different situation as compared to the balkans and soldiers from europe are not prepared for it .
" one needs a very robust mandate for congo , " naumann said , adding it should include the preemptive use of weapons . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international community begins to respond to congo fighting following horror reports of cannibalism , armed children and the discovery of more than 300 bodies , the international community finally looks ready to step in and stop brutal fighting in the democratic republic of congo .

g8 leaders , including britain 's tony blair -lrb- l . -rrb- meet on sunday .
u.s. president bush forgave russia and largely ignored germany on his short stopover in evian .
though hundreds of protestors rioted in nearby switzerland , the g8 summit kicked off as planned . observers say there is a motto that some top washington officials go by when it comes to how to treat europe 's iraq war opponents : " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia . " with president george w. bush 's short trip through europe winding down with a one day visit to the alpine spa town of evian for the group of eight summit , it seems two of the three have so far occurred . at a celebration of st. petersburg 's 300th anniversary in petershof castle saturday evening , bush extended his hand and a curt " how are you , " to chancellor gerhard schröder , ending weeks of speculation in the german press on whether the two would press the flesh . " fine , " schröder reportedly responded , bringing the pleasantries to a close .
it was the last one-on-one between the two planned for this trip .
they will not meet privately at evian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush , left , leans in to talk to russian president vladimir putin , right prior to the start of their bilateral meeting at konstantin palace sunday , june 1 , 2003 in st. petersburg , russia .
president bush challenged allies saturday to overcome their bitterness and mistrust over the iraq war and unite in the struggle against terrorism .
bush and putin met privately and held a joint news conference before they travel to evian , france , for the annual summit of major industrialized nations .
-lrb- ap photo / j. scott applewhite -rrb- the sunday morning after the schröder-bush handshake , putin and bush appeared in front of journalists after a private morning discussion .
the two smiled and said they had swept aside their differences over iraq .
bush and putin also pressed north korea to give up their nuclear program . washington apparently made no inroads in stopping russia 's involvement in developing iran 's nuclear program .
questions on russia 's concerns about losing existing iraqi oil contracts were brushed aside . genetically-modified food dispute upon the u.s. president 's arrival in france , french president jacques chirac met bush and offered him a public , if stiff handshake .
the two will meet privately monday amid a g8 meeting that will cover issues ranging from sparking the slumping world economy to strengthening the middle east peace process . though bush has carried a message of reconciliation on this european trip , with stops in krakow , st. petersburg and evian , the eu and u.s. might clash over europe 's import ban on genetically-modified food . with an eye on both africa and their own farming industry , the bush administration has maintained that genetically-modified food , which can grow in adverse climates , is crucial to helping africa overcome its famine woes .
europe has refused to import such products because of fears of health and environmental risks . the meeting of the g8 , which includes the u.s. , the u.k. , germany , france , japan , russia , canada and italy , is due to end monday . protestors riot , march peacefully tens of thousands of protestors have made their presence felt ahead of the summit .

about 300 masked anti-globalisation activists started rioting in lausanne sunday morning , looting a gas station and setting on fire trash cans and construction boards .
demonstrators have gathered in lausanne and geneva over the last days to protest the g8 summit taking place in nearby evian , france , june 1 to june 3 .
-lrb- ap photo / keystone , andree-noelle pot -rrb- rampaged through downtown geneva , switzerland , on the other side of the lake from french evian .
police officers , out in force , fired tear gas cannisters , rubber bullets and water hoses to contain the black-hooded anarchists and globalization critics .
the protestors said the g8 were ignoring the plight of the world 's poor and smashed shop windows in rich towns like lausanne and geneva .

" with president george w. bush 's short trip through europe winding down with a one day visit to the alpine spa town of evian for the group of eight summit , it seems two of the three have so far occurred . at a celebration of st. petersburg 's 300th anniversary in petershof castle saturday evening , bush extended his hand and a curt " how are you , " to chancellor gerhard schröder , ending weeks of speculation in the german press on whether the two would press the flesh . " fine , " schröder reportedly responded , bringing the pleasantries to a close .

the two will meet privately monday amid a g8 meeting that will cover issues ranging from sparking the slumping world economy to strengthening the middle east peace process . though bush has carried a message of reconciliation on this european trip , with stops in krakow , st. petersburg and evian , the eu and u.s. might clash over europe 's import ban on genetically-modified food . with an eye on both africa and their own farming industry , the bush administration has maintained that genetically-modified food , which can grow in adverse climates , is crucial to helping africa overcome its famine woes .
europe has refused to import such products because of fears of health and environmental risks . the meeting of the g8 , which includes the u.s. , the u.k. , germany , france , japan , russia , canada and italy , is due to end monday . protestors riot , march peacefully tens of thousands of protestors have made their presence felt ahead of the summit .

eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east . the strike comes after union members voted overwhelmingly on friday to down their tools after negotiations with employers broke down .
engineering trade union ig metall wants to see the weekly working hours of auto and metal industry workers in germany ’ s eastern states cut from 38 to the 35 currently required of workers in western germany .
" thirteen years after german reunification we need further steps to realize equal work and income conditions throughout germany , " said ig metall boss klaus zwickel on monday morning at a volkswagen plant in zwickau , south of dresden .
the strike could be the start of the largest labor unrest seen in germany since ig metall workers across the country left production lines last year in a pay dispute with employers .
some 12,000 workers from 15 different plants took part in monday ’ s strike .
eastern workers are expected to strike sporadically throughout the region until thursday and , if no agreement is reached , the work stoppages will be expanded next week .
around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east are employed in the engineering sector , which includes automakers such as volkswagen and bmw , as well as heavy industry like steel .
zwickel laments " fairness gap " zwickel has called the hours discrepancy between east and west a " fairness gap , " but employers and many economists point out that many eastern operations have a much lower productivity than their western counterparts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , dismissed the question of fairness in an interview on german radio .
" the only thing that ’ s fair is what helps us move germany forward , " rogowski told deutschlandfunk monday morning .
some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist east .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce .
the dispute also comes at bad moment for german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is attempting to push through unpopular reforms in the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and inflexible labor market .
unions have vehemently opposed schröder ’ s so-called " agenda 2010 " that aims to cut welfare benefits and loosen job-protection rules .
that opposition to reform has led many in germany to regard organized labor as a stumbling block to restructuring the country ’ s moribund economy .
by striking to cut their hours when many easterners are out of work , ig metall runs the risk of further isolating the unions from the public at large .
although ig metall says some 15,000 new jobs would be created by shortening the week by three hours , employers and others contend at least 20,000 would be lost by the increased labor costs .
" what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " christian democrats party leader angela merkel told ard public television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise between unions and employers averts strike after 31 hours of difficult negotiations , trade union leaders and employers agreed on a pay deal for public sector workers , averting widespread strikes .
but german local authorities still foresee problems .
-lrb- january 11 , 2003 -rrb- ig metall strike yields 4 % pay increase germany 's engineering sector has ended a 10-day pay dispute in a settlement that is widely seen as a victory for the unions , although employers welcomed the longer-than-usual 22-month period over which it will be valid .

the troops will reinforce the current 700-strong lightly-armed u.n. force in the ituri region , where ethnic fighting has left more than 400 dead in recent weeks .
under the u.n. charter , the new troops , which will be in place until september 1 , 2003 , are authorized to use force to prevent widespread massacres , protect civilians and secure the nearby airport .
france is sending 800 to 1,000 soldiers , while belgium , spain , italy and britain are reported to consider contributing troops .
question marks over german participation the deployment of the emergency force , which the u.n. hopes will help avoid a repeat of massacres such as in rwanda and bosnia in the 1990s , has raised fresh questions about german military participation in international peacekeeping activities .
u.n. secretary general kofi anan requested the eu two weeks ago to put together an emergency peacekeeping force for congo .
the request came at a time when eu leaders were making final decisions on the formation of a rapid reaction force .
though eu foreign policy chief javier solana was eager to mark the beginning of the eu 's first military operation in africa , eu diplomats told reuters last week berlin was initially cool to anan ’ s request .
the german government is reported to have had misgivings about an eu operation in congo and argued that congo was too distant from europe , a tough military challenge and a conflict on which there was no agreed eu foreign policy .
but in an apparent change of stance foreign minister joschka fischer told solana at a g8 foreign ministers meeting in paris recently that germany would drop objections to the deployment of an eu peacekeeping force in eastern congo , but would not actively participate .
likewise , german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller , who has been touring the conflict-torn region , described german military involvement as " very difficult " .
speaking to reporters in uganda over the weekend , the minister said u.n. secretary-general anan wanted both france and germany to participate in peace operations .
" the force certainly merits every support , but we need to examine what ’ s possible within our capabilities , " she said adding that germany would politically support the peace mission and provide humanitarian help .
müller stressed that germany was already the second-largest troop-provider in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and in the balkans .
germany ’ s ambassador to the u.n. gunter pleuger last week also ruled out german troop participation .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans .
i don ’ t know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now , " he told reporters .
politicians in favor of military involvement however , leading politicians from germany ’ s main parties are urging germany to get involved in stopping the congolese bloodshed .
the ruling social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- defense expert verena wohlleben told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the deployment of an eu force under a u.n.-mandate was the " right way " .
her view was echoed by the green party ’ s deputy parliamentary leader winfried nachtwei .
" we must now quickly decide how the german military can contribute to the eu mission in the congo , " he told the paper .
foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- friedbert pflüger urged the german government to provide financial and logistical support to the congo mission , including the deployment of the mobile army hospital " medevac " .
even the liberal free democratic party ’ s -lrb- fdp -rrb- deputy chairman walter döring told the welt am sonntag paper that everything must be done to avoid a " second rwanda . "
" if the eu intervenes under a u.n. mandate , germany must send troops , " he said .
former bundeswehr general warns of dangers but despite the overwhelming support for german participation in the congo from across party lines , former german bundeswehr general klaus naumann has warned against dispatching eu troops to congo .
naumann told the welt am sonntag the northeast congo entails an entirely different situation as compared to the balkans and soldiers from europe are not prepared for it .

the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .
but the first all-european planetary exploration effort must overcome the bad luck that has plagued previous missions . the red planet has never been kind to scientists .
roughly two-thirds of the 30 missions to mars are considered failures .
officials from the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- hope their mars express probe will shake off the curse , so it can settle once and for all whether life exists , has existed , or ever can exist on earth ’ s neighbor . " we do not know what happened to the planet in the past .
which process turned mars into the dry , cold world we see today ? " said agustin chicarro , esa 's mars express project scientist , in a statement .
" with mars express , we will find out .
above all , we aim to obtain a complete global view of the planet - its history , its geology , how it has evolved .
real planetology ! " though space exploration has always been challenging , the stakes for the esa are particularly high .
europe ’ s aerospace industry is hoping to raise its profile amid stiff competition from the united states , russia , japan and even china . the mars express is only one of three missions taking off this month to take advantage of a period when earth and mars are at their closest point in 17 years .
the motto of the 300-million-euro mission is “ faster , smarter , and more cost-effective ” than any previous exploration of mars . more responsibility for private sector the mission also hopes to succeed by giving more responsibility to the 24 private technology companies that are taking part in the project . the mission will begin at roughly 7:45 pm central european time , when a russian soyuz rocket lifts off from the baikonur cosmodrome in the central asian republic of kazakhstan .
sitting atop the powerful rocket will be a planetary orbiter and a small , 65-kilogram british lander probe called the beagle 2 , in honor of the ship that carried charles darwin to the galapagos islands in 1831 . some time in december , the orbiter and the beagle will separate high above mars and a german control team in the city of darmstadt near frankfurt will guide the beagle to a controlled collision with the planet ’ s surface , somewhere in an area 300 kilometers long and 150 kilometers wide .
parachutes will slow the decent and air balloons encasing the probe will enable it to bounce to a cushioned landing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beagle 2 lander .
if all goes according to plan , the beagle will play a short , nine-note tune composed by the british pop group blur to alert mission control that the beagle has landed . over the following months it will explore the planet ’ s atmosphere , surface , and sub-surface .
the beagle will gather information both with a gas sniffing “ nose ” for analysis of the air and with a probe which will collect samples from as much as two meters below the surface of the planet . then if the mission ’ s luck holds , the beagle will relay its data to the orbiter , which will beam it back to earth for two years .
but that ’ s only if the red planet decides to be a little nicer to earth ’ s scientists . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space agency prepares for mars voyage with the planets aligning just right , the european space agency is moving forward with plans to launch the mars express in june – a precursor to manned missions to the red planet .

the troops will reinforce the current 700-strong lightly-armed u.n. force in the ituri region , where ethnic fighting has left more than 400 dead in recent weeks .
under the u.n. charter , the new troops , which will be in place until september 1 , 2003 , are authorized to use force to prevent widespread massacres , protect civilians and secure the nearby airport .
france is sending 800 to 1,000 soldiers , while belgium , spain , italy and britain are reported to consider contributing troops .
question marks over german participation the deployment of the emergency force , which the u.n. hopes will help avoid a repeat of massacres such as in rwanda and bosnia in the 1990s , has raised fresh questions about german military participation in international peacekeeping activities .
u.n. secretary general kofi anan requested the eu two weeks ago to put together an emergency peacekeeping force for congo .
the request came at a time when eu leaders were making final decisions on the formation of a rapid reaction force .
though eu foreign policy chief javier solana was eager to mark the beginning of the eu 's first military operation in africa , eu diplomats told reuters last week berlin was initially cool to anan ’ s request .
the german government is reported to have had misgivings about an eu operation in congo and argued that congo was too distant from europe , a tough military challenge and a conflict on which there was no agreed eu foreign policy .
but in an apparent change of stance foreign minister joschka fischer told solana at a g8 foreign ministers meeting in paris recently that germany would drop objections to the deployment of an eu peacekeeping force in eastern congo , but would not actively participate .
likewise , german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller , who has been touring the conflict-torn region , described german military involvement as " very difficult " .
speaking to reporters in uganda over the weekend , the minister said u.n. secretary-general anan wanted both france and germany to participate in peace operations .
" the force certainly merits every support , but we need to examine what ’ s possible within our capabilities , " she said adding that germany would politically support the peace mission and provide humanitarian help .
müller stressed that germany was already the second-largest troop-provider in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and in the balkans .
germany ’ s ambassador to the u.n. gunter pleuger last week also ruled out german troop participation .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans .
i don ’ t know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now , " he told reporters .
politicians in favor of military involvement however , leading politicians from germany ’ s main parties are urging germany to get involved in stopping the congolese bloodshed .
the ruling social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- defense expert verena wohlleben told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the deployment of an eu force under a u.n.-mandate was the " right way " .
her view was echoed by the green party ’ s deputy parliamentary leader winfried nachtwei .
" we must now quickly decide how the german military can contribute to the eu mission in the congo , " he told the paper .
foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- friedbert pflüger urged the german government to provide financial and logistical support to the congo mission , including the deployment of the mobile army hospital " medevac " .
even the liberal free democratic party ’ s -lrb- fdp -rrb- deputy chairman walter döring told the welt am sonntag paper that everything must be done to avoid a " second rwanda . "
" if the eu intervenes under a u.n. mandate , germany must send troops , " he said .
former bundeswehr general warns of dangers but despite the overwhelming support for german participation in the congo from across party lines , former german bundeswehr general klaus naumann has warned against dispatching eu troops to congo .
naumann told the welt am sonntag the northeast congo entails an entirely different situation as compared to the balkans and soldiers from europe are not prepared for it .
" one needs a very robust mandate for congo , " naumann said , adding it should include the preemptive use of weapons . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international community begins to respond to congo fighting following horror reports of cannibalism , armed children and the discovery of more than 300 bodies , the international community finally looks ready to step in and stop brutal fighting in the democratic republic of congo .

eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east . the strike comes after union members voted overwhelmingly on friday to down their tools after negotiations with employers broke down .
engineering trade union ig metall wants to see the weekly working hours of auto and metal industry workers in germany ’ s eastern states cut from 38 to the 35 currently required of workers in western germany .
" thirteen years after german reunification we need further steps to realize equal work and income conditions throughout germany , " said ig metall boss klaus zwickel on monday morning at a volkswagen plant in zwickau , south of dresden .
the strike could be the start of the largest labor unrest seen in germany since ig metall workers across the country left production lines last year in a pay dispute with employers .
some 12,000 workers from 15 different plants took part in monday ’ s strike .
eastern workers are expected to strike sporadically throughout the region until thursday and , if no agreement is reached , the work stoppages will be expanded next week .
around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east are employed in the engineering sector , which includes automakers such as volkswagen and bmw , as well as heavy industry like steel .
zwickel laments " fairness gap " zwickel has called the hours discrepancy between east and west a " fairness gap , " but employers and many economists point out that many eastern operations have a much lower productivity than their western counterparts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , dismissed the question of fairness in an interview on german radio .
" the only thing that ’ s fair is what helps us move germany forward , " rogowski told deutschlandfunk monday morning .
some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist east .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce .
the dispute also comes at bad moment for german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is attempting to push through unpopular reforms in the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and inflexible labor market .
unions have vehemently opposed schröder ’ s so-called " agenda 2010 " that aims to cut welfare benefits and loosen job-protection rules .
that opposition to reform has led many in germany to regard organized labor as a stumbling block to restructuring the country ’ s moribund economy .
by striking to cut their hours when many easterners are out of work , ig metall runs the risk of further isolating the unions from the public at large .
although ig metall says some 15,000 new jobs would be created by shortening the week by three hours , employers and others contend at least 20,000 would be lost by the increased labor costs .

eastern workers are expected to strike sporadically throughout the region until thursday and , if no agreement is reached , the work stoppages will be expanded next week .
around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east are employed in the engineering sector , which includes automakers such as volkswagen and bmw , as well as heavy industry like steel .
zwickel laments " fairness gap " zwickel has called the hours discrepancy between east and west a " fairness gap , " but employers and many economists point out that many eastern operations have a much lower productivity than their western counterparts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , dismissed the question of fairness in an interview on german radio .
" the only thing that ’ s fair is what helps us move germany forward , " rogowski told deutschlandfunk monday morning .
some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist east .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce .
the dispute also comes at bad moment for german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is attempting to push through unpopular reforms in the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and inflexible labor market .
unions have vehemently opposed schröder ’ s so-called " agenda 2010 " that aims to cut welfare benefits and loosen job-protection rules .
that opposition to reform has led many in germany to regard organized labor as a stumbling block to restructuring the country ’ s moribund economy .
by striking to cut their hours when many easterners are out of work , ig metall runs the risk of further isolating the unions from the public at large .
although ig metall says some 15,000 new jobs would be created by shortening the week by three hours , employers and others contend at least 20,000 would be lost by the increased labor costs .
" what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " christian democrats party leader angela merkel told ard public television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise between unions and employers averts strike after 31 hours of difficult negotiations , trade union leaders and employers agreed on a pay deal for public sector workers , averting widespread strikes .
but german local authorities still foresee problems .
-lrb- january 11 , 2003 -rrb- ig metall strike yields 4 % pay increase germany 's engineering sector has ended a 10-day pay dispute in a settlement that is widely seen as a victory for the unions , although employers welcomed the longer-than-usual 22-month period over which it will be valid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.06.2003 europe launches mars express probe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mars express will take six months to reach the red planet .
the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .
but the first all-european planetary exploration effort must overcome the bad luck that has plagued previous missions . the red planet has never been kind to scientists .
roughly two-thirds of the 30 missions to mars are considered failures .
officials from the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- hope their mars express probe will shake off the curse , so it can settle once and for all whether life exists , has existed , or ever can exist on earth ’ s neighbor . " we do not know what happened to the planet in the past .
which process turned mars into the dry , cold world we see today ? " said agustin chicarro , esa 's mars express project scientist , in a statement .
" with mars express , we will find out .
above all , we aim to obtain a complete global view of the planet - its history , its geology , how it has evolved .
real planetology ! " though space exploration has always been challenging , the stakes for the esa are particularly high .
europe ’ s aerospace industry is hoping to raise its profile amid stiff competition from the united states , russia , japan and even china . the mars express is only one of three missions taking off this month to take advantage of a period when earth and mars are at their closest point in 17 years .
the motto of the 300-million-euro mission is “ faster , smarter , and more cost-effective ” than any previous exploration of mars . more responsibility for private sector the mission also hopes to succeed by giving more responsibility to the 24 private technology companies that are taking part in the project . the mission will begin at roughly 7:45 pm central european time , when a russian soyuz rocket lifts off from the baikonur cosmodrome in the central asian republic of kazakhstan .
sitting atop the powerful rocket will be a planetary orbiter and a small , 65-kilogram british lander probe called the beagle 2 , in honor of the ship that carried charles darwin to the galapagos islands in 1831 . some time in december , the orbiter and the beagle will separate high above mars and a german control team in the city of darmstadt near frankfurt will guide the beagle to a controlled collision with the planet ’ s surface , somewhere in an area 300 kilometers long and 150 kilometers wide .
parachutes will slow the decent and air balloons encasing the probe will enable it to bounce to a cushioned landing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beagle 2 lander .
if all goes according to plan , the beagle will play a short , nine-note tune composed by the british pop group blur to alert mission control that the beagle has landed . over the following months it will explore the planet ’ s atmosphere , surface , and sub-surface .
the beagle will gather information both with a gas sniffing “ nose ” for analysis of the air and with a probe which will collect samples from as much as two meters below the surface of the planet . then if the mission ’ s luck holds , the beagle will relay its data to the orbiter , which will beam it back to earth for two years .
but that ’ s only if the red planet decides to be a little nicer to earth ’ s scientists . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european space agency prepares for mars voyage with the planets aligning just right , the european space agency is moving forward with plans to launch the mars express in june – a precursor to manned missions to the red planet .

the troops will reinforce the current 700-strong lightly-armed u.n. force in the ituri region , where ethnic fighting has left more than 400 dead in recent weeks .
under the u.n. charter , the new troops , which will be in place until september 1 , 2003 , are authorized to use force to prevent widespread massacres , protect civilians and secure the nearby airport .
france is sending 800 to 1,000 soldiers , while belgium , spain , italy and britain are reported to consider contributing troops .
question marks over german participation the deployment of the emergency force , which the u.n. hopes will help avoid a repeat of massacres such as in rwanda and bosnia in the 1990s , has raised fresh questions about german military participation in international peacekeeping activities .
u.n. secretary general kofi anan requested the eu two weeks ago to put together an emergency peacekeeping force for congo .
the request came at a time when eu leaders were making final decisions on the formation of a rapid reaction force .
though eu foreign policy chief javier solana was eager to mark the beginning of the eu 's first military operation in africa , eu diplomats told reuters last week berlin was initially cool to anan ’ s request .
the german government is reported to have had misgivings about an eu operation in congo and argued that congo was too distant from europe , a tough military challenge and a conflict on which there was no agreed eu foreign policy .
but in an apparent change of stance foreign minister joschka fischer told solana at a g8 foreign ministers meeting in paris recently that germany would drop objections to the deployment of an eu peacekeeping force in eastern congo , but would not actively participate .
likewise , german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller , who has been touring the conflict-torn region , described german military involvement as " very difficult " .
speaking to reporters in uganda over the weekend , the minister said u.n. secretary-general anan wanted both france and germany to participate in peace operations .
" the force certainly merits every support , but we need to examine what ’ s possible within our capabilities , " she said adding that germany would politically support the peace mission and provide humanitarian help .
müller stressed that germany was already the second-largest troop-provider in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and in the balkans .
germany ’ s ambassador to the u.n. gunter pleuger last week also ruled out german troop participation .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans .
i don ’ t know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now , " he told reporters .
politicians in favor of military involvement however , leading politicians from germany ’ s main parties are urging germany to get involved in stopping the congolese bloodshed .
the ruling social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- defense expert verena wohlleben told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the deployment of an eu force under a u.n.-mandate was the " right way " .
her view was echoed by the green party ’ s deputy parliamentary leader winfried nachtwei .
" we must now quickly decide how the german military can contribute to the eu mission in the congo , " he told the paper .
foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- friedbert pflüger urged the german government to provide financial and logistical support to the congo mission , including the deployment of the mobile army hospital " medevac " .
even the liberal free democratic party ’ s -lrb- fdp -rrb- deputy chairman walter döring told the welt am sonntag paper that everything must be done to avoid a " second rwanda . "
" if the eu intervenes under a u.n. mandate , germany must send troops , " he said .
former bundeswehr general warns of dangers but despite the overwhelming support for german participation in the congo from across party lines , former german bundeswehr general klaus naumann has warned against dispatching eu troops to congo .
naumann told the welt am sonntag the northeast congo entails an entirely different situation as compared to the balkans and soldiers from europe are not prepared for it .
" one needs a very robust mandate for congo , " naumann said , adding it should include the preemptive use of weapons . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international community begins to respond to congo fighting following horror reports of cannibalism , armed children and the discovery of more than 300 bodies , the international community finally looks ready to step in and stop brutal fighting in the democratic republic of congo .

g8 leaders , including britain 's tony blair -lrb- l . -rrb- meet on sunday .
u.s. president bush forgave russia and largely ignored germany on his short stopover in evian .
though hundreds of protestors rioted in nearby switzerland , the g8 summit kicked off as planned . observers say there is a motto that some top washington officials go by when it comes to how to treat europe 's iraq war opponents : " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia . " with president george w. bush 's short trip through europe winding down with a one day visit to the alpine spa town of evian for the group of eight summit , it seems two of the three have so far occurred . at a celebration of st. petersburg 's 300th anniversary in petershof castle saturday evening , bush extended his hand and a curt " how are you , " to chancellor gerhard schröder , ending weeks of speculation in the german press on whether the two would press the flesh . " fine , " schröder reportedly responded , bringing the pleasantries to a close .
it was the last one-on-one between the two planned for this trip .
they will not meet privately at evian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush , left , leans in to talk to russian president vladimir putin , right prior to the start of their bilateral meeting at konstantin palace sunday , june 1 , 2003 in st. petersburg , russia .
president bush challenged allies saturday to overcome their bitterness and mistrust over the iraq war and unite in the struggle against terrorism .
bush and putin met privately and held a joint news conference before they travel to evian , france , for the annual summit of major industrialized nations .
-lrb- ap photo / j. scott applewhite -rrb- the sunday morning after the schröder-bush handshake , putin and bush appeared in front of journalists after a private morning discussion .
the two smiled and said they had swept aside their differences over iraq .
bush and putin also pressed north korea to give up their nuclear program . washington apparently made no inroads in stopping russia 's involvement in developing iran 's nuclear program .
questions on russia 's concerns about losing existing iraqi oil contracts were brushed aside . genetically-modified food dispute upon the u.s. president 's arrival in france , french president jacques chirac met bush and offered him a public , if stiff handshake .
the two will meet privately monday amid a g8 meeting that will cover issues ranging from sparking the slumping world economy to strengthening the middle east peace process . though bush has carried a message of reconciliation on this european trip , with stops in krakow , st. petersburg and evian , the eu and u.s. might clash over europe 's import ban on genetically-modified food . with an eye on both africa and their own farming industry , the bush administration has maintained that genetically-modified food , which can grow in adverse climates , is crucial to helping africa overcome its famine woes .
europe has refused to import such products because of fears of health and environmental risks . the meeting of the g8 , which includes the u.s. , the u.k. , germany , france , japan , russia , canada and italy , is due to end monday . protestors riot , march peacefully tens of thousands of protestors have made their presence felt ahead of the summit .

the protestors said the g8 were ignoring the plight of the world 's poor and smashed shop windows in rich towns like lausanne and geneva .
french and swiss police have set up a 15 km zone around the meeting headquarters to shut out demonstrators .
thousands of protestors managed to block the road between lausanne and the french border , which skirts geneva , but did n't hinder delegates on their way to the summit .

g8 leaders , including britain 's tony blair -lrb- l . -rrb- meet on sunday .
u.s. president bush forgave russia and largely ignored germany on his short stopover in evian .
though hundreds of protestors rioted in nearby switzerland , the g8 summit kicked off as planned . observers say there is a motto that some top washington officials go by when it comes to how to treat europe 's iraq war opponents : " punish france , ignore germany and forgive russia . " with president george w. bush 's short trip through europe winding down with a one day visit to the alpine spa town of evian for the group of eight summit , it seems two of the three have so far occurred . at a celebration of st. petersburg 's 300th anniversary in petershof castle saturday evening , bush extended his hand and a curt " how are you , " to chancellor gerhard schröder , ending weeks of speculation in the german press on whether the two would press the flesh . " fine , " schröder reportedly responded , bringing the pleasantries to a close .
it was the last one-on-one between the two planned for this trip .

the two will meet privately monday amid a g8 meeting that will cover issues ranging from sparking the slumping world economy to strengthening the middle east peace process . though bush has carried a message of reconciliation on this european trip , with stops in krakow , st. petersburg and evian , the eu and u.s. might clash over europe 's import ban on genetically-modified food . with an eye on both africa and their own farming industry , the bush administration has maintained that genetically-modified food , which can grow in adverse climates , is crucial to helping africa overcome its famine woes .
europe has refused to import such products because of fears of health and environmental risks . the meeting of the g8 , which includes the u.s. , the u.k. , germany , france , japan , russia , canada and italy , is due to end monday . protestors riot , march peacefully tens of thousands of protestors have made their presence felt ahead of the summit .

eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east . the strike comes after union members voted overwhelmingly on friday to down their tools after negotiations with employers broke down .
engineering trade union ig metall wants to see the weekly working hours of auto and metal industry workers in germany ’ s eastern states cut from 38 to the 35 currently required of workers in western germany .
" thirteen years after german reunification we need further steps to realize equal work and income conditions throughout germany , " said ig metall boss klaus zwickel on monday morning at a volkswagen plant in zwickau , south of dresden .
the strike could be the start of the largest labor unrest seen in germany since ig metall workers across the country left production lines last year in a pay dispute with employers .
some 12,000 workers from 15 different plants took part in monday ’ s strike .

eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

" thirteen years after german reunification we need further steps to realize equal work and income conditions throughout germany , " said ig metall boss klaus zwickel on monday morning at a volkswagen plant in zwickau , south of dresden .

the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .
but the first all-european planetary exploration effort must overcome the bad luck that has plagued previous missions . the red planet has never been kind to scientists .
roughly two-thirds of the 30 missions to mars are considered failures .
officials from the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- hope their mars express probe will shake off the curse , so it can settle once and for all whether life exists , has existed , or ever can exist on earth ’ s neighbor . " we do not know what happened to the planet in the past .
which process turned mars into the dry , cold world we see today ? " said agustin chicarro , esa 's mars express project scientist , in a statement .
" with mars express , we will find out .
above all , we aim to obtain a complete global view of the planet - its history , its geology , how it has evolved .
real planetology ! " though space exploration has always been challenging , the stakes for the esa are particularly high .
europe ’ s aerospace industry is hoping to raise its profile amid stiff competition from the united states , russia , japan and even china . the mars express is only one of three missions taking off this month to take advantage of a period when earth and mars are at their closest point in 17 years .
the motto of the 300-million-euro mission is “ faster , smarter , and more cost-effective ” than any previous exploration of mars . more responsibility for private sector the mission also hopes to succeed by giving more responsibility to the 24 private technology companies that are taking part in the project . the mission will begin at roughly 7:45 pm central european time , when a russian soyuz rocket lifts off from the baikonur cosmodrome in the central asian republic of kazakhstan .
sitting atop the powerful rocket will be a planetary orbiter and a small , 65-kilogram british lander probe called the beagle 2 , in honor of the ship that carried charles darwin to the galapagos islands in 1831 . some time in december , the orbiter and the beagle will separate high above mars and a german control team in the city of darmstadt near frankfurt will guide the beagle to a controlled collision with the planet ’ s surface , somewhere in an area 300 kilometers long and 150 kilometers wide .
parachutes will slow the decent and air balloons encasing the probe will enable it to bounce to a cushioned landing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beagle 2 lander .
if all goes according to plan , the beagle will play a short , nine-note tune composed by the british pop group blur to alert mission control that the beagle has landed . over the following months it will explore the planet ’ s atmosphere , surface , and sub-surface .
the beagle will gather information both with a gas sniffing “ nose ” for analysis of the air and with a probe which will collect samples from as much as two meters below the surface of the planet . then if the mission ’ s luck holds , the beagle will relay its data to the orbiter , which will beam it back to earth for two years .

the troops will reinforce the current 700-strong lightly-armed u.n. force in the ituri region , where ethnic fighting has left more than 400 dead in recent weeks .
under the u.n. charter , the new troops , which will be in place until september 1 , 2003 , are authorized to use force to prevent widespread massacres , protect civilians and secure the nearby airport .
france is sending 800 to 1,000 soldiers , while belgium , spain , italy and britain are reported to consider contributing troops .
question marks over german participation the deployment of the emergency force , which the u.n. hopes will help avoid a repeat of massacres such as in rwanda and bosnia in the 1990s , has raised fresh questions about german military participation in international peacekeeping activities .
u.n. secretary general kofi anan requested the eu two weeks ago to put together an emergency peacekeeping force for congo .
the request came at a time when eu leaders were making final decisions on the formation of a rapid reaction force .
though eu foreign policy chief javier solana was eager to mark the beginning of the eu 's first military operation in africa , eu diplomats told reuters last week berlin was initially cool to anan ’ s request .
the german government is reported to have had misgivings about an eu operation in congo and argued that congo was too distant from europe , a tough military challenge and a conflict on which there was no agreed eu foreign policy .
but in an apparent change of stance foreign minister joschka fischer told solana at a g8 foreign ministers meeting in paris recently that germany would drop objections to the deployment of an eu peacekeeping force in eastern congo , but would not actively participate .
likewise , german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller , who has been touring the conflict-torn region , described german military involvement as " very difficult " .
speaking to reporters in uganda over the weekend , the minister said u.n. secretary-general anan wanted both france and germany to participate in peace operations .
" the force certainly merits every support , but we need to examine what ’ s possible within our capabilities , " she said adding that germany would politically support the peace mission and provide humanitarian help .
müller stressed that germany was already the second-largest troop-provider in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and in the balkans .
germany ’ s ambassador to the u.n. gunter pleuger last week also ruled out german troop participation .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans .
i don ’ t know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now , " he told reporters .
politicians in favor of military involvement however , leading politicians from germany ’ s main parties are urging germany to get involved in stopping the congolese bloodshed .
the ruling social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- defense expert verena wohlleben told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the deployment of an eu force under a u.n.-mandate was the " right way " .
her view was echoed by the green party ’ s deputy parliamentary leader winfried nachtwei .
" we must now quickly decide how the german military can contribute to the eu mission in the congo , " he told the paper .
foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- friedbert pflüger urged the german government to provide financial and logistical support to the congo mission , including the deployment of the mobile army hospital " medevac " .
even the liberal free democratic party ’ s -lrb- fdp -rrb- deputy chairman walter döring told the welt am sonntag paper that everything must be done to avoid a " second rwanda . "
" if the eu intervenes under a u.n. mandate , germany must send troops , " he said .
former bundeswehr general warns of dangers but despite the overwhelming support for german participation in the congo from across party lines , former german bundeswehr general klaus naumann has warned against dispatching eu troops to congo .
naumann told the welt am sonntag the northeast congo entails an entirely different situation as compared to the balkans and soldiers from europe are not prepared for it .

eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east . the strike comes after union members voted overwhelmingly on friday to down their tools after negotiations with employers broke down .
engineering trade union ig metall wants to see the weekly working hours of auto and metal industry workers in germany ’ s eastern states cut from 38 to the 35 currently required of workers in western germany .
" thirteen years after german reunification we need further steps to realize equal work and income conditions throughout germany , " said ig metall boss klaus zwickel on monday morning at a volkswagen plant in zwickau , south of dresden .
the strike could be the start of the largest labor unrest seen in germany since ig metall workers across the country left production lines last year in a pay dispute with employers .
some 12,000 workers from 15 different plants took part in monday ’ s strike .
eastern workers are expected to strike sporadically throughout the region until thursday and , if no agreement is reached , the work stoppages will be expanded next week .
around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east are employed in the engineering sector , which includes automakers such as volkswagen and bmw , as well as heavy industry like steel .
zwickel laments " fairness gap " zwickel has called the hours discrepancy between east and west a " fairness gap , " but employers and many economists point out that many eastern operations have a much lower productivity than their western counterparts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , dismissed the question of fairness in an interview on german radio .
" the only thing that ’ s fair is what helps us move germany forward , " rogowski told deutschlandfunk monday morning .
some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist east .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce .
the dispute also comes at bad moment for german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is attempting to push through unpopular reforms in the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and inflexible labor market .
unions have vehemently opposed schröder ’ s so-called " agenda 2010 " that aims to cut welfare benefits and loosen job-protection rules .
that opposition to reform has led many in germany to regard organized labor as a stumbling block to restructuring the country ’ s moribund economy .
by striking to cut their hours when many easterners are out of work , ig metall runs the risk of further isolating the unions from the public at large .
although ig metall says some 15,000 new jobs would be created by shortening the week by three hours , employers and others contend at least 20,000 would be lost by the increased labor costs .
" what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " christian democrats party leader angela merkel told ard public television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise between unions and employers averts strike after 31 hours of difficult negotiations , trade union leaders and employers agreed on a pay deal for public sector workers , averting widespread strikes .

eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east . the strike comes after union members voted overwhelmingly on friday to down their tools after negotiations with employers broke down .
engineering trade union ig metall wants to see the weekly working hours of auto and metal industry workers in germany ’ s eastern states cut from 38 to the 35 currently required of workers in western germany .
" thirteen years after german reunification we need further steps to realize equal work and income conditions throughout germany , " said ig metall boss klaus zwickel on monday morning at a volkswagen plant in zwickau , south of dresden .
the strike could be the start of the largest labor unrest seen in germany since ig metall workers across the country left production lines last year in a pay dispute with employers .
some 12,000 workers from 15 different plants took part in monday ’ s strike .
eastern workers are expected to strike sporadically throughout the region until thursday and , if no agreement is reached , the work stoppages will be expanded next week .
around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east are employed in the engineering sector , which includes automakers such as volkswagen and bmw , as well as heavy industry like steel .
zwickel laments " fairness gap " zwickel has called the hours discrepancy between east and west a " fairness gap , " but employers and many economists point out that many eastern operations have a much lower productivity than their western counterparts .

the troops will reinforce the current 700-strong lightly-armed u.n. force in the ituri region , where ethnic fighting has left more than 400 dead in recent weeks .
under the u.n. charter , the new troops , which will be in place until september 1 , 2003 , are authorized to use force to prevent widespread massacres , protect civilians and secure the nearby airport .
france is sending 800 to 1,000 soldiers , while belgium , spain , italy and britain are reported to consider contributing troops .
question marks over german participation the deployment of the emergency force , which the u.n. hopes will help avoid a repeat of massacres such as in rwanda and bosnia in the 1990s , has raised fresh questions about german military participation in international peacekeeping activities .
u.n. secretary general kofi anan requested the eu two weeks ago to put together an emergency peacekeeping force for congo .
the request came at a time when eu leaders were making final decisions on the formation of a rapid reaction force .
though eu foreign policy chief javier solana was eager to mark the beginning of the eu 's first military operation in africa , eu diplomats told reuters last week berlin was initially cool to anan ’ s request .
the german government is reported to have had misgivings about an eu operation in congo and argued that congo was too distant from europe , a tough military challenge and a conflict on which there was no agreed eu foreign policy .
but in an apparent change of stance foreign minister joschka fischer told solana at a g8 foreign ministers meeting in paris recently that germany would drop objections to the deployment of an eu peacekeeping force in eastern congo , but would not actively participate .
likewise , german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller , who has been touring the conflict-torn region , described german military involvement as " very difficult " .
speaking to reporters in uganda over the weekend , the minister said u.n. secretary-general anan wanted both france and germany to participate in peace operations .
" the force certainly merits every support , but we need to examine what ’ s possible within our capabilities , " she said adding that germany would politically support the peace mission and provide humanitarian help .
müller stressed that germany was already the second-largest troop-provider in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and in the balkans .
germany ’ s ambassador to the u.n. gunter pleuger last week also ruled out german troop participation .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans .
i don ’ t know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now , " he told reporters .
politicians in favor of military involvement however , leading politicians from germany ’ s main parties are urging germany to get involved in stopping the congolese bloodshed .
the ruling social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- defense expert verena wohlleben told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the deployment of an eu force under a u.n.-mandate was the " right way " .
her view was echoed by the green party ’ s deputy parliamentary leader winfried nachtwei .
" we must now quickly decide how the german military can contribute to the eu mission in the congo , " he told the paper .
foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- friedbert pflüger urged the german government to provide financial and logistical support to the congo mission , including the deployment of the mobile army hospital " medevac " .
even the liberal free democratic party ’ s -lrb- fdp -rrb- deputy chairman walter döring told the welt am sonntag paper that everything must be done to avoid a " second rwanda . "
" if the eu intervenes under a u.n. mandate , germany must send troops , " he said .
former bundeswehr general warns of dangers but despite the overwhelming support for german participation in the congo from across party lines , former german bundeswehr general klaus naumann has warned against dispatching eu troops to congo .
naumann told the welt am sonntag the northeast congo entails an entirely different situation as compared to the balkans and soldiers from europe are not prepared for it .

the troops will reinforce the current 700-strong lightly-armed u.n. force in the ituri region , where ethnic fighting has left more than 400 dead in recent weeks .
under the u.n. charter , the new troops , which will be in place until september 1 , 2003 , are authorized to use force to prevent widespread massacres , protect civilians and secure the nearby airport .
france is sending 800 to 1,000 soldiers , while belgium , spain , italy and britain are reported to consider contributing troops .
question marks over german participation the deployment of the emergency force , which the u.n. hopes will help avoid a repeat of massacres such as in rwanda and bosnia in the 1990s , has raised fresh questions about german military participation in international peacekeeping activities .
u.n. secretary general kofi anan requested the eu two weeks ago to put together an emergency peacekeeping force for congo .
the request came at a time when eu leaders were making final decisions on the formation of a rapid reaction force .
though eu foreign policy chief javier solana was eager to mark the beginning of the eu 's first military operation in africa , eu diplomats told reuters last week berlin was initially cool to anan ’ s request .
the german government is reported to have had misgivings about an eu operation in congo and argued that congo was too distant from europe , a tough military challenge and a conflict on which there was no agreed eu foreign policy .
but in an apparent change of stance foreign minister joschka fischer told solana at a g8 foreign ministers meeting in paris recently that germany would drop objections to the deployment of an eu peacekeeping force in eastern congo , but would not actively participate .
likewise , german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller , who has been touring the conflict-torn region , described german military involvement as " very difficult " .
speaking to reporters in uganda over the weekend , the minister said u.n. secretary-general anan wanted both france and germany to participate in peace operations .
" the force certainly merits every support , but we need to examine what ’ s possible within our capabilities , " she said adding that germany would politically support the peace mission and provide humanitarian help .
müller stressed that germany was already the second-largest troop-provider in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and in the balkans .
germany ’ s ambassador to the u.n. gunter pleuger last week also ruled out german troop participation .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans .
i don ’ t know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now , " he told reporters .
politicians in favor of military involvement however , leading politicians from germany ’ s main parties are urging germany to get involved in stopping the congolese bloodshed .
the ruling social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- defense expert verena wohlleben told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the deployment of an eu force under a u.n.-mandate was the " right way " .
her view was echoed by the green party ’ s deputy parliamentary leader winfried nachtwei .
" we must now quickly decide how the german military can contribute to the eu mission in the congo , " he told the paper .
foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- friedbert pflüger urged the german government to provide financial and logistical support to the congo mission , including the deployment of the mobile army hospital " medevac " .
even the liberal free democratic party ’ s -lrb- fdp -rrb- deputy chairman walter döring told the welt am sonntag paper that everything must be done to avoid a " second rwanda . "

the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .
but the first all-european planetary exploration effort must overcome the bad luck that has plagued previous missions . the red planet has never been kind to scientists .
roughly two-thirds of the 30 missions to mars are considered failures .
officials from the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- hope their mars express probe will shake off the curse , so it can settle once and for all whether life exists , has existed , or ever can exist on earth ’ s neighbor . " we do not know what happened to the planet in the past .
which process turned mars into the dry , cold world we see today ? " said agustin chicarro , esa 's mars express project scientist , in a statement .
" with mars express , we will find out .
above all , we aim to obtain a complete global view of the planet - its history , its geology , how it has evolved .

europe ’ s aerospace industry is hoping to raise its profile amid stiff competition from the united states , russia , japan and even china . the mars express is only one of three missions taking off this month to take advantage of a period when earth and mars are at their closest point in 17 years .
the motto of the 300-million-euro mission is “ faster , smarter , and more cost-effective ” than any previous exploration of mars . more responsibility for private sector the mission also hopes to succeed by giving more responsibility to the 24 private technology companies that are taking part in the project . the mission will begin at roughly 7:45 pm central european time , when a russian soyuz rocket lifts off from the baikonur cosmodrome in the central asian republic of kazakhstan .
sitting atop the powerful rocket will be a planetary orbiter and a small , 65-kilogram british lander probe called the beagle 2 , in honor of the ship that carried charles darwin to the galapagos islands in 1831 . some time in december , the orbiter and the beagle will separate high above mars and a german control team in the city of darmstadt near frankfurt will guide the beagle to a controlled collision with the planet ’ s surface , somewhere in an area 300 kilometers long and 150 kilometers wide .
parachutes will slow the decent and air balloons encasing the probe will enable it to bounce to a cushioned landing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beagle 2 lander .
if all goes according to plan , the beagle will play a short , nine-note tune composed by the british pop group blur to alert mission control that the beagle has landed . over the following months it will explore the planet ’ s atmosphere , surface , and sub-surface .
the beagle will gather information both with a gas sniffing “ nose ” for analysis of the air and with a probe which will collect samples from as much as two meters below the surface of the planet . then if the mission ’ s luck holds , the beagle will relay its data to the orbiter , which will beam it back to earth for two years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.06.2003 eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : striking steel workers hope to cut their hours from 38 to 35 a week .
eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east . the strike comes after union members voted overwhelmingly on friday to down their tools after negotiations with employers broke down .
engineering trade union ig metall wants to see the weekly working hours of auto and metal industry workers in germany ’ s eastern states cut from 38 to the 35 currently required of workers in western germany .
" thirteen years after german reunification we need further steps to realize equal work and income conditions throughout germany , " said ig metall boss klaus zwickel on monday morning at a volkswagen plant in zwickau , south of dresden .
the strike could be the start of the largest labor unrest seen in germany since ig metall workers across the country left production lines last year in a pay dispute with employers .
some 12,000 workers from 15 different plants took part in monday ’ s strike .
eastern workers are expected to strike sporadically throughout the region until thursday and , if no agreement is reached , the work stoppages will be expanded next week .
around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east are employed in the engineering sector , which includes automakers such as volkswagen and bmw , as well as heavy industry like steel .
zwickel laments " fairness gap " zwickel has called the hours discrepancy between east and west a " fairness gap , " but employers and many economists point out that many eastern operations have a much lower productivity than their western counterparts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , dismissed the question of fairness in an interview on german radio .
" the only thing that ’ s fair is what helps us move germany forward , " rogowski told deutschlandfunk monday morning .
some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist east .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce .
the dispute also comes at bad moment for german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is attempting to push through unpopular reforms in the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and inflexible labor market .
unions have vehemently opposed schröder ’ s so-called " agenda 2010 " that aims to cut welfare benefits and loosen job-protection rules .
that opposition to reform has led many in germany to regard organized labor as a stumbling block to restructuring the country ’ s moribund economy .
by striking to cut their hours when many easterners are out of work , ig metall runs the risk of further isolating the unions from the public at large .
although ig metall says some 15,000 new jobs would be created by shortening the week by three hours , employers and others contend at least 20,000 would be lost by the increased labor costs .
" what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " christian democrats party leader angela merkel told ard public television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise between unions and employers averts strike after 31 hours of difficult negotiations , trade union leaders and employers agreed on a pay deal for public sector workers , averting widespread strikes .
but german local authorities still foresee problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 02.06.2003 congo mission raises questions about german military involvement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.n. hopes to avoid widespread massacres in the congo by sending peacekeepers the u.n. security council ’ s approval for a french-led international force in strife-torn eastern congo has renewed debate in germany on the commitment of troops outside europe . after receiving authorization from the united nations security council on friday , a 1,400 strong multinational peacekeeping force led by france is due to begin deploying troops to the democratic republic of congo as part of efforts to end brutal killings in the country ’ s civil war-torn northeastern provinces .
the troops will reinforce the current 700-strong lightly-armed u.n. force in the ituri region , where ethnic fighting has left more than 400 dead in recent weeks .
under the u.n. charter , the new troops , which will be in place until september 1 , 2003 , are authorized to use force to prevent widespread massacres , protect civilians and secure the nearby airport .
france is sending 800 to 1,000 soldiers , while belgium , spain , italy and britain are reported to consider contributing troops .
question marks over german participation the deployment of the emergency force , which the u.n. hopes will help avoid a repeat of massacres such as in rwanda and bosnia in the 1990s , has raised fresh questions about german military participation in international peacekeeping activities .
u.n. secretary general kofi anan requested the eu two weeks ago to put together an emergency peacekeeping force for congo .
the request came at a time when eu leaders were making final decisions on the formation of a rapid reaction force .
though eu foreign policy chief javier solana was eager to mark the beginning of the eu 's first military operation in africa , eu diplomats told reuters last week berlin was initially cool to anan ’ s request .
the german government is reported to have had misgivings about an eu operation in congo and argued that congo was too distant from europe , a tough military challenge and a conflict on which there was no agreed eu foreign policy .
but in an apparent change of stance foreign minister joschka fischer told solana at a g8 foreign ministers meeting in paris recently that germany would drop objections to the deployment of an eu peacekeeping force in eastern congo , but would not actively participate .
likewise , german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller , who has been touring the conflict-torn region , described german military involvement as " very difficult " .
speaking to reporters in uganda over the weekend , the minister said u.n. secretary-general anan wanted both france and germany to participate in peace operations .
" the force certainly merits every support , but we need to examine what ’ s possible within our capabilities , " she said adding that germany would politically support the peace mission and provide humanitarian help .
müller stressed that germany was already the second-largest troop-provider in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and in the balkans .
germany ’ s ambassador to the u.n. gunter pleuger last week also ruled out german troop participation .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans .
i don ’ t know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now , " he told reporters .
politicians in favor of military involvement however , leading politicians from germany ’ s main parties are urging germany to get involved in stopping the congolese bloodshed .
the ruling social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- defense expert verena wohlleben told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the deployment of an eu force under a u.n.-mandate was the " right way " .
her view was echoed by the green party ’ s deputy parliamentary leader winfried nachtwei .
" we must now quickly decide how the german military can contribute to the eu mission in the congo , " he told the paper .
foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- friedbert pflüger urged the german government to provide financial and logistical support to the congo mission , including the deployment of the mobile army hospital " medevac " .
even the liberal free democratic party ’ s -lrb- fdp -rrb- deputy chairman walter döring told the welt am sonntag paper that everything must be done to avoid a " second rwanda . "
" if the eu intervenes under a u.n. mandate , germany must send troops , " he said .
former bundeswehr general warns of dangers but despite the overwhelming support for german participation in the congo from across party lines , former german bundeswehr general klaus naumann has warned against dispatching eu troops to congo .
naumann told the welt am sonntag the northeast congo entails an entirely different situation as compared to the balkans and soldiers from europe are not prepared for it .
" one needs a very robust mandate for congo , " naumann said , adding it should include the preemptive use of weapons . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international community begins to respond to congo fighting following horror reports of cannibalism , armed children and the discovery of more than 300 bodies , the international community finally looks ready to step in and stop brutal fighting in the democratic republic of congo .

eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east . the strike comes after union members voted overwhelmingly on friday to down their tools after negotiations with employers broke down .
engineering trade union ig metall wants to see the weekly working hours of auto and metal industry workers in germany ’ s eastern states cut from 38 to the 35 currently required of workers in western germany .
" thirteen years after german reunification we need further steps to realize equal work and income conditions throughout germany , " said ig metall boss klaus zwickel on monday morning at a volkswagen plant in zwickau , south of dresden .
the strike could be the start of the largest labor unrest seen in germany since ig metall workers across the country left production lines last year in a pay dispute with employers .
some 12,000 workers from 15 different plants took part in monday ’ s strike .
eastern workers are expected to strike sporadically throughout the region until thursday and , if no agreement is reached , the work stoppages will be expanded next week .
around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east are employed in the engineering sector , which includes automakers such as volkswagen and bmw , as well as heavy industry like steel .
zwickel laments " fairness gap " zwickel has called the hours discrepancy between east and west a " fairness gap , " but employers and many economists point out that many eastern operations have a much lower productivity than their western counterparts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , dismissed the question of fairness in an interview on german radio .
" the only thing that ’ s fair is what helps us move germany forward , " rogowski told deutschlandfunk monday morning .
some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist east .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce .
the dispute also comes at bad moment for german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is attempting to push through unpopular reforms in the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and inflexible labor market .
unions have vehemently opposed schröder ’ s so-called " agenda 2010 " that aims to cut welfare benefits and loosen job-protection rules .
that opposition to reform has led many in germany to regard organized labor as a stumbling block to restructuring the country ’ s moribund economy .
by striking to cut their hours when many easterners are out of work , ig metall runs the risk of further isolating the unions from the public at large .
although ig metall says some 15,000 new jobs would be created by shortening the week by three hours , employers and others contend at least 20,000 would be lost by the increased labor costs .
" what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " christian democrats party leader angela merkel told ard public television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise between unions and employers averts strike after 31 hours of difficult negotiations , trade union leaders and employers agreed on a pay deal for public sector workers , averting widespread strikes .

the european space agency was set to launch an ambitious project to search for life on mars monday .
but the first all-european planetary exploration effort must overcome the bad luck that has plagued previous missions . the red planet has never been kind to scientists .
roughly two-thirds of the 30 missions to mars are considered failures .
officials from the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- hope their mars express probe will shake off the curse , so it can settle once and for all whether life exists , has existed , or ever can exist on earth ’ s neighbor . " we do not know what happened to the planet in the past .
which process turned mars into the dry , cold world we see today ? " said agustin chicarro , esa 's mars express project scientist , in a statement .
" with mars express , we will find out .
above all , we aim to obtain a complete global view of the planet - its history , its geology , how it has evolved .
real planetology ! " though space exploration has always been challenging , the stakes for the esa are particularly high .
europe ’ s aerospace industry is hoping to raise its profile amid stiff competition from the united states , russia , japan and even china . the mars express is only one of three missions taking off this month to take advantage of a period when earth and mars are at their closest point in 17 years .
the motto of the 300-million-euro mission is “ faster , smarter , and more cost-effective ” than any previous exploration of mars . more responsibility for private sector the mission also hopes to succeed by giving more responsibility to the 24 private technology companies that are taking part in the project . the mission will begin at roughly 7:45 pm central european time , when a russian soyuz rocket lifts off from the baikonur cosmodrome in the central asian republic of kazakhstan .
sitting atop the powerful rocket will be a planetary orbiter and a small , 65-kilogram british lander probe called the beagle 2 , in honor of the ship that carried charles darwin to the galapagos islands in 1831 . some time in december , the orbiter and the beagle will separate high above mars and a german control team in the city of darmstadt near frankfurt will guide the beagle to a controlled collision with the planet ’ s surface , somewhere in an area 300 kilometers long and 150 kilometers wide .
parachutes will slow the decent and air balloons encasing the probe will enable it to bounce to a cushioned landing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beagle 2 lander .
if all goes according to plan , the beagle will play a short , nine-note tune composed by the british pop group blur to alert mission control that the beagle has landed . over the following months it will explore the planet ’ s atmosphere , surface , and sub-surface .
the beagle will gather information both with a gas sniffing “ nose ” for analysis of the air and with a probe which will collect samples from as much as two meters below the surface of the planet . then if the mission ’ s luck holds , the beagle will relay its data to the orbiter , which will beam it back to earth for two years .

eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east . the strike comes after union members voted overwhelmingly on friday to down their tools after negotiations with employers broke down .
engineering trade union ig metall wants to see the weekly working hours of auto and metal industry workers in germany ’ s eastern states cut from 38 to the 35 currently required of workers in western germany .
" thirteen years after german reunification we need further steps to realize equal work and income conditions throughout germany , " said ig metall boss klaus zwickel on monday morning at a volkswagen plant in zwickau , south of dresden .
the strike could be the start of the largest labor unrest seen in germany since ig metall workers across the country left production lines last year in a pay dispute with employers .
some 12,000 workers from 15 different plants took part in monday ’ s strike .
eastern workers are expected to strike sporadically throughout the region until thursday and , if no agreement is reached , the work stoppages will be expanded next week .
around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east are employed in the engineering sector , which includes automakers such as volkswagen and bmw , as well as heavy industry like steel .
zwickel laments " fairness gap " zwickel has called the hours discrepancy between east and west a " fairness gap , " but employers and many economists point out that many eastern operations have a much lower productivity than their western counterparts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , dismissed the question of fairness in an interview on german radio .
" the only thing that ’ s fair is what helps us move germany forward , " rogowski told deutschlandfunk monday morning .
some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist east .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce .
the dispute also comes at bad moment for german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is attempting to push through unpopular reforms in the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and inflexible labor market .
unions have vehemently opposed schröder ’ s so-called " agenda 2010 " that aims to cut welfare benefits and loosen job-protection rules .
that opposition to reform has led many in germany to regard organized labor as a stumbling block to restructuring the country ’ s moribund economy .
by striking to cut their hours when many easterners are out of work , ig metall runs the risk of further isolating the unions from the public at large .
although ig metall says some 15,000 new jobs would be created by shortening the week by three hours , employers and others contend at least 20,000 would be lost by the increased labor costs .

eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines on monday , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east . the strike comes after union members voted overwhelmingly on friday to down their tools after negotiations with employers broke down .
engineering trade union ig metall wants to see the weekly working hours of auto and metal industry workers in germany ’ s eastern states cut from 38 to the 35 currently required of workers in western germany .
" thirteen years after german reunification we need further steps to realize equal work and income conditions throughout germany , " said ig metall boss klaus zwickel on monday morning at a volkswagen plant in zwickau , south of dresden .
the strike could be the start of the largest labor unrest seen in germany since ig metall workers across the country left production lines last year in a pay dispute with employers .
some 12,000 workers from 15 different plants took part in monday ’ s strike .
eastern workers are expected to strike sporadically throughout the region until thursday and , if no agreement is reached , the work stoppages will be expanded next week .
around 310,000 people in germany ’ s former communist east are employed in the engineering sector , which includes automakers such as volkswagen and bmw , as well as heavy industry like steel .
zwickel laments " fairness gap " zwickel has called the hours discrepancy between east and west a " fairness gap , " but employers and many economists point out that many eastern operations have a much lower productivity than their western counterparts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rogowski michael rogowski , president of the federation of german industry , dismissed the question of fairness in an interview on german radio .
" the only thing that ’ s fair is what helps us move germany forward , " rogowski told deutschlandfunk monday morning .
some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist east .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce .
the dispute also comes at bad moment for german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is attempting to push through unpopular reforms in the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and inflexible labor market .
unions have vehemently opposed schröder ’ s so-called " agenda 2010 " that aims to cut welfare benefits and loosen job-protection rules .
that opposition to reform has led many in germany to regard organized labor as a stumbling block to restructuring the country ’ s moribund economy .
by striking to cut their hours when many easterners are out of work , ig metall runs the risk of further isolating the unions from the public at large .
although ig metall says some 15,000 new jobs would be created by shortening the week by three hours , employers and others contend at least 20,000 would be lost by the increased labor costs .
" what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " christian democrats party leader angela merkel told ard public television . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise between unions and employers averts strike after 31 hours of difficult negotiations , trade union leaders and employers agreed on a pay deal for public sector workers , averting widespread strikes .

the troops will reinforce the current 700-strong lightly-armed u.n. force in the ituri region , where ethnic fighting has left more than 400 dead in recent weeks .
under the u.n. charter , the new troops , which will be in place until september 1 , 2003 , are authorized to use force to prevent widespread massacres , protect civilians and secure the nearby airport .
france is sending 800 to 1,000 soldiers , while belgium , spain , italy and britain are reported to consider contributing troops .
question marks over german participation the deployment of the emergency force , which the u.n. hopes will help avoid a repeat of massacres such as in rwanda and bosnia in the 1990s , has raised fresh questions about german military participation in international peacekeeping activities .
u.n. secretary general kofi anan requested the eu two weeks ago to put together an emergency peacekeeping force for congo .
the request came at a time when eu leaders were making final decisions on the formation of a rapid reaction force .
though eu foreign policy chief javier solana was eager to mark the beginning of the eu 's first military operation in africa , eu diplomats told reuters last week berlin was initially cool to anan ’ s request .
the german government is reported to have had misgivings about an eu operation in congo and argued that congo was too distant from europe , a tough military challenge and a conflict on which there was no agreed eu foreign policy .
but in an apparent change of stance foreign minister joschka fischer told solana at a g8 foreign ministers meeting in paris recently that germany would drop objections to the deployment of an eu peacekeeping force in eastern congo , but would not actively participate .
likewise , german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller , who has been touring the conflict-torn region , described german military involvement as " very difficult " .
speaking to reporters in uganda over the weekend , the minister said u.n. secretary-general anan wanted both france and germany to participate in peace operations .
" the force certainly merits every support , but we need to examine what ’ s possible within our capabilities , " she said adding that germany would politically support the peace mission and provide humanitarian help .
müller stressed that germany was already the second-largest troop-provider in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and in the balkans .
germany ’ s ambassador to the u.n. gunter pleuger last week also ruled out german troop participation .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans .
i don ’ t know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now , " he told reporters .
politicians in favor of military involvement however , leading politicians from germany ’ s main parties are urging germany to get involved in stopping the congolese bloodshed .
the ruling social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- defense expert verena wohlleben told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the deployment of an eu force under a u.n.-mandate was the " right way " .
her view was echoed by the green party ’ s deputy parliamentary leader winfried nachtwei .
" we must now quickly decide how the german military can contribute to the eu mission in the congo , " he told the paper .
foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- friedbert pflüger urged the german government to provide financial and logistical support to the congo mission , including the deployment of the mobile army hospital " medevac " .
even the liberal free democratic party ’ s -lrb- fdp -rrb- deputy chairman walter döring told the welt am sonntag paper that everything must be done to avoid a " second rwanda . "
" if the eu intervenes under a u.n. mandate , germany must send troops , " he said .
former bundeswehr general warns of dangers but despite the overwhelming support for german participation in the congo from across party lines , former german bundeswehr general klaus naumann has warned against dispatching eu troops to congo .
naumann told the welt am sonntag the northeast congo entails an entirely different situation as compared to the balkans and soldiers from europe are not prepared for it .

the troops will reinforce the current 700-strong lightly-armed u.n. force in the ituri region , where ethnic fighting has left more than 400 dead in recent weeks .
under the u.n. charter , the new troops , which will be in place until september 1 , 2003 , are authorized to use force to prevent widespread massacres , protect civilians and secure the nearby airport .
france is sending 800 to 1,000 soldiers , while belgium , spain , italy and britain are reported to consider contributing troops .
question marks over german participation the deployment of the emergency force , which the u.n. hopes will help avoid a repeat of massacres such as in rwanda and bosnia in the 1990s , has raised fresh questions about german military participation in international peacekeeping activities .
u.n. secretary general kofi anan requested the eu two weeks ago to put together an emergency peacekeeping force for congo .
the request came at a time when eu leaders were making final decisions on the formation of a rapid reaction force .
though eu foreign policy chief javier solana was eager to mark the beginning of the eu 's first military operation in africa , eu diplomats told reuters last week berlin was initially cool to anan ’ s request .
the german government is reported to have had misgivings about an eu operation in congo and argued that congo was too distant from europe , a tough military challenge and a conflict on which there was no agreed eu foreign policy .
but in an apparent change of stance foreign minister joschka fischer told solana at a g8 foreign ministers meeting in paris recently that germany would drop objections to the deployment of an eu peacekeeping force in eastern congo , but would not actively participate .
likewise , german deputy foreign minister kerstin müller , who has been touring the conflict-torn region , described german military involvement as " very difficult " .
speaking to reporters in uganda over the weekend , the minister said u.n. secretary-general anan wanted both france and germany to participate in peace operations .
" the force certainly merits every support , but we need to examine what ’ s possible within our capabilities , " she said adding that germany would politically support the peace mission and provide humanitarian help .
müller stressed that germany was already the second-largest troop-provider in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and in the balkans .
germany ’ s ambassador to the u.n. gunter pleuger last week also ruled out german troop participation .
" one must consider that we already play the leading role in peacekeeping operations in afghanistan and are also heavily involved in keeping the peace in the balkans .
i don ’ t know whether the military forces can be available for such a thing right now , " he told reporters .
politicians in favor of military involvement however , leading politicians from germany ’ s main parties are urging germany to get involved in stopping the congolese bloodshed .
the ruling social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- defense expert verena wohlleben told the bild am sonntag newspaper that the deployment of an eu force under a u.n.-mandate was the " right way " .
her view was echoed by the green party ’ s deputy parliamentary leader winfried nachtwei .
" we must now quickly decide how the german military can contribute to the eu mission in the congo , " he told the paper .
foreign affairs expert for the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- friedbert pflüger urged the german government to provide financial and logistical support to the congo mission , including the deployment of the mobile army hospital " medevac " .
even the liberal free democratic party ’ s -lrb- fdp -rrb- deputy chairman walter döring told the welt am sonntag paper that everything must be done to avoid a " second rwanda . "
" if the eu intervenes under a u.n. mandate , germany must send troops , " he said .
former bundeswehr general warns of dangers but despite the overwhelming support for german participation in the congo from across party lines , former german bundeswehr general klaus naumann has warned against dispatching eu troops to congo .
naumann told the welt am sonntag the northeast congo entails an entirely different situation as compared to the balkans and soldiers from europe are not prepared for it .

scientists found that women who smoked just six to seven cigarettes per day gave birth to babies who more jittery , more excitable , stiffer and more difficult to console than newborns of non-smokers .
we have a legal drug in nicotine that may have the same toxic effect as illegal drugs karen law and the higher the dose of nicotine measured in a mother , the greater the signs of stress in her new baby .
the behavioural changes were similar to those found in newborns of women who use crack cocaine or heroin while pregnant - and were strong enough to suggest that babies go through a " nicotine withdrawal " response .
researcher karen law , from brown university , providence , rhode island , said : " we have a legal drug in nicotine that may have the same toxic effect as illegal drugs .
" it is a huge public health concern that so many people are suffering the costs of smoking , including newborns . "
policy shift her colleague dr barry lester said there was far more concern about the use of illegal drugs during pregnancy , than the use of tobacco .
however , up to six times more women smoked during pregnancy than took illegal drugs .
the new findings suggested that greater efforts were needed to focus on the dangers of smoking .
he said : " if a behaviourally vulnerable baby receives attention and care , there is no reason to think that the child wo n't thrive .
" but we also know that the same baby is at risk for a poor developmental outcome if that child grows up in a stressed , low-income environment , where effects of exposure get exaggerated . "
the research focused on 27 babies who were exposed to tobacco smoke in the womb , and 29 who were not .
the " nicotine " infants were abnormally tense and rigid , required more handling and showed greater signs of stress .
the babies ' exposure to nicotine was measured by analysing saliva samples from the mothers for traces of a chemical called cotinine , produced when nicotine is broken down by the body .
professor david edwards , a neonatologist at imperial college , london , told bbc news online further research would be required to draw any firm conclusions about the effect of exposure to tobacco smoke in the womb .
he said that as yet there was no evidence to equate the effect of tobacco exposure to that of cocaine , which constricts the blood vessels and can cause babies to suffer a stroke .
but he said : " we should make every possible attempt to stop mothers smoking during pregnancy . "
gay sutherland , a psychologist working for the charity action on addiction , said only one in four women smokers quit when they are pregnant , and 80 % of those who do manage to give up relapse within a year of giving birth , exposing their babies to the dangers of passive smoking .
she said : " action on addiction hopes this research will encourage more women to seek help to give up completely while pregnant , for their own health as well of that of their babies . "
the research is published in the journal pediatrics .
