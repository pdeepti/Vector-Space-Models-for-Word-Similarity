in public , they are sticking to the refrain that the plan is good , it is on track , and there have been no delays .
but there is little escaping the fact that they have had to make adjustments because of the potential threat to their supply lines , the strength of opposition around the population centres in the south in particular , and the weather .
us troops are waiting to attack baghdad defence secretary donald rumsfeld has been particularly under the spotlight .
critics of the war strategy blame him for pressing the military to move more quickly with fewer forces than they would have liked .
to add to an already complex picture , mr rumsfeld has fired verbal warning shots at two of iraq 's neighbours , syria and iran .
according to mr rumsfeld , the americans have information that equipment , including night-vision goggles , has been crossing into iraq from syria .
in a stark public warning to damascus , the defence secretary said that such shipments would be a hostile act and that the us government would hold the syrian government accountable .
he would not be drawn on whether he was threatening military action .
ranks closing mr rumsfeld also had another warning for iran , or at least to several hundred iranian-backed iraqi dissidents he said were present in iraq .
this was complicating us war plans , he said , and they would be considered combatatants if they interfered with us-led forces .
but he sidestepped the question of whether he was threatening military action .
and , just right now , the pentagon appears to have enough on its plate .
it is unclear when the push towards the iraqi capital will be renewed both in public and behind the scenes at the pentagon , the civilian and military leadership have closed ranks over the war plan , insisting that it was agreed by all the top commanders .
still , the senior us army officer on the ground in iraq , lt gen william wallace , says the us military is facing a different enemy from the one it expected .
the pentagon , it seems , underestimated the iraqis ' ability to adapt and learn from the lessons of the past decade or so of us military operations , including their previous confrontation in 1991 .
push still on despite the problems , america 's top commanders say they are sticking to the priority of pressing towards baghdad , despite the resistance in the south .
but it is unclear when the push towards the iraqi capital will be renewed .
any hopes that the iraqi authorities might have crumbled in the face of the americans ' rapid early advance and heavy initial air strikes seem to have evaporated .
the criticism among analysts and retired senior military officers has been that the initial us-led invasion force was too small , and lacks sufficient firepower .
the pentagon says that there are at least 100,000 extra troops still in the pipeline to be deployed .
but the soonest the closest of those forces , the 4th infantry division , will be ready to fight will be a number of weeks .
the initial hope must have been that these " follow-on " forces would not be needed at all , or at worst would have to help simply with mopping up and stabilisation operations after a conflict .
it is looking increasingly as if at least some of these reinforcements may now actually have to join the fight .

al-jazeera has been heavily criticised for showing pictures of us and uk pows cnn outstripped its competitors 13 years ago with its rolling live coverage of the outbreak of hostilities and seemed always to be in the right place at the right time to report the war 's main events live .
al-jazeera is drawing a growing audience .
it is also drawing some angry criticism , for filming and broadcasting pictures that other networks have not got or will not show .
uk prime minister tony blair has expressed " horror " at the broadcast of pictures believed to show two dead british soldiers .
i can see why american and british politicians and military leaders do n't like us showing these pictures .
they show a side of the war that they do n't want projected because it may affect public opinion in their country negatively yosri fouda al-jazeera the commander of the uk forces in the gulf , air marshall brian burridge condemned al-jazeera 's broadcasts as " deplorable " and a " flagrant breach " of the geneva convention .
he also warned journalists not to become part of the " iraqi propaganda machine " .
al-jazeera drew criticism from the us for broadcasting footage of killed and captured american soldiers .
the channel 's executives have responded by arguing that the coalition leaders are disapproving because it is becoming more difficult for the us and uk to manage the reporting of the war .
graphic pictures for the first time , arab news networks , including competitors like abu dhabi 's tv station , have had a big audience and greater access to some areas of iraq than western stations , yosri fouda , the bureau chief for al-jazeera in london told bbc news online .
" i can see why american and british politicians and military leaders do n't like us showing these pictures .
they show a side of the war that they do n't want projected because it may affect public opinion in their country negatively .
" in these things , the western media is highly sanitised .
you are not seeing what war , this war , is actually like .
" as for the geneva convention , there are double standards here .
we and other broadcasters were not criticised for showing pictures of iraqi dead and captured , or those famous pictures from guantanamo bay , " yosri fouda said .
al-jazeera launched : 1996 audience : 35 million motto : " opinion ... and the other opinion " based in qatar and funded by the emir of qatar what critics say : bin laden 's channel , and iraqi propaganda what supporters say : first independent arabic channel , and offers alternative to western media 's world view al-jazeera and bin laden kuwait shuts al-jazeera office kabul offices hit in us raid by western television standards , the pictures shown by al-jazeera and other arabic news stations are shockingly graphic .
the channels will readily show for far longer and in greater detail scenes of carnage in baghdad , gaza or jerusalem .
" for western audiences , " al-jazeera 's yosri fouda said , " part of the shock is in seeing american and british dead bodies and pows . "
the channel also has correspondents all over iraq .
while it has reporters with coalition troops and at central command in qatar , it also has reporters in towns that the western media can not reach .
when western journalists outside basra were speculating about an uprising on the basis of coalition briefings , al-jazeera 's correspondent inside the city was reporting first hand that " the streets are very calm and there are no indications of violence or riots " .
in the current conflict al-jazeera is referring to us and uk forces in iraq as " invading forces " , not " forces of aggression " - the standard phrase on arabic tv stations , including iraq 's .
' bin laden 's channel ' al-jazeera 's reputation in the west was made during and after the war in afghanistan , when it broadcast exclusive messages from osama bin laden .
al-jazeera has broadcast exclusive statements by osama bin laden in the arabic-speaking world , al-jazeera has for years had a large and loyal audience and a reputation as innovative and hard-hitting .
most importantly it is seen as independent of the smothering restrictions widely suffered by national broadcasters in the middle east .
al-jazeera was launched after the closure of the bbc world service 's arabic language tv newsroom in 1996 .
many of al-jazeera 's editors , journalists , presenters and technical staff cut their teeth as tv journalists with the bbc in london .
the channel revolutionised arabic language news by taking a critical and combative style to officials and religious leaders and tackling issues too sensitive for other arabic language broadcasters to touch .
alternative view us officials have criticised the channel as anti-american and encouraging islamic militancy .
according to al-jazeera , the number of subscribers to the channel in europe has doubled since the start of the war in iraq .
the channel explains this audience increase , and its appeal in general , as a huge demand for an alternative to western reporting of the war .
arab tv viewers go to al-jazeera because they see it as an independent news channel that sees the world as they do .
western broadcasters are seen by many arabs and muslims as pro-western and uncritical of israel .
while allowing interviewees to criticise the united states in terms that would seldom be seen on western tv screens , the channel has also carried long interviews with tony blair , condoleezza rice , donald rumsfeld and ariel sharon .
the channel has also got on the wrong side of several arab regimes .
its reporters have at times been banned or harassed in egypt , kuwait , jordan and the palestinian authority .
it has been criticised by saudi arabia and was according to al-jazeera described by bahrain as being pro-zionist .
in a timely coup , al-jazeera this week won a " freedom of expression " award for its general news coverage from index on censorship , an international group which campaigns against censorship .
amid the criticism they have been facing , defenders of the channel may see this as confirmation that al-jazeera is doing a job the western media is not and that the criticisms are an attempt to muzzle it .

al-jazeera has been heavily criticised for showing pictures of us and uk pows cnn outstripped its competitors 13 years ago with its rolling live coverage of the outbreak of hostilities and seemed always to be in the right place at the right time to report the war 's main events live .
al-jazeera is drawing a growing audience .
it is also drawing some angry criticism , for filming and broadcasting pictures that other networks have not got or will not show .
uk prime minister tony blair has expressed " horror " at the broadcast of pictures believed to show two dead british soldiers .
i can see why american and british politicians and military leaders do n't like us showing these pictures .
they show a side of the war that they do n't want projected because it may affect public opinion in their country negatively yosri fouda al-jazeera the commander of the uk forces in the gulf , air marshall brian burridge condemned al-jazeera 's broadcasts as " deplorable " and a " flagrant breach " of the geneva convention .
he also warned journalists not to become part of the " iraqi propaganda machine " .
al-jazeera drew criticism from the us for broadcasting footage of killed and captured american soldiers .
the channel 's executives have responded by arguing that the coalition leaders are disapproving because it is becoming more difficult for the us and uk to manage the reporting of the war .
graphic pictures for the first time , arab news networks , including competitors like abu dhabi 's tv station , have had a big audience and greater access to some areas of iraq than western stations , yosri fouda , the bureau chief for al-jazeera in london told bbc news online .
" i can see why american and british politicians and military leaders do n't like us showing these pictures .
they show a side of the war that they do n't want projected because it may affect public opinion in their country negatively .
" in these things , the western media is highly sanitised .
you are not seeing what war , this war , is actually like .
" as for the geneva convention , there are double standards here .
we and other broadcasters were not criticised for showing pictures of iraqi dead and captured , or those famous pictures from guantanamo bay , " yosri fouda said .
al-jazeera launched : 1996 audience : 35 million motto : " opinion ... and the other opinion " based in qatar and funded by the emir of qatar what critics say : bin laden 's channel , and iraqi propaganda what supporters say : first independent arabic channel , and offers alternative to western media 's world view al-jazeera and bin laden kuwait shuts al-jazeera office kabul offices hit in us raid by western television standards , the pictures shown by al-jazeera and other arabic news stations are shockingly graphic .
the channels will readily show for far longer and in greater detail scenes of carnage in baghdad , gaza or jerusalem .
" for western audiences , " al-jazeera 's yosri fouda said , " part of the shock is in seeing american and british dead bodies and pows . "
the channel also has correspondents all over iraq .
while it has reporters with coalition troops and at central command in qatar , it also has reporters in towns that the western media can not reach .
when western journalists outside basra were speculating about an uprising on the basis of coalition briefings , al-jazeera 's correspondent inside the city was reporting first hand that " the streets are very calm and there are no indications of violence or riots " .
in the current conflict al-jazeera is referring to us and uk forces in iraq as " invading forces " , not " forces of aggression " - the standard phrase on arabic tv stations , including iraq 's .
' bin laden 's channel ' al-jazeera 's reputation in the west was made during and after the war in afghanistan , when it broadcast exclusive messages from osama bin laden .
al-jazeera has broadcast exclusive statements by osama bin laden in the arabic-speaking world , al-jazeera has for years had a large and loyal audience and a reputation as innovative and hard-hitting .
most importantly it is seen as independent of the smothering restrictions widely suffered by national broadcasters in the middle east .
al-jazeera was launched after the closure of the bbc world service 's arabic language tv newsroom in 1996 .
many of al-jazeera 's editors , journalists , presenters and technical staff cut their teeth as tv journalists with the bbc in london .
the channel revolutionised arabic language news by taking a critical and combative style to officials and religious leaders and tackling issues too sensitive for other arabic language broadcasters to touch .
alternative view us officials have criticised the channel as anti-american and encouraging islamic militancy .
according to al-jazeera , the number of subscribers to the channel in europe has doubled since the start of the war in iraq .
the channel explains this audience increase , and its appeal in general , as a huge demand for an alternative to western reporting of the war .
arab tv viewers go to al-jazeera because they see it as an independent news channel that sees the world as they do .
western broadcasters are seen by many arabs and muslims as pro-western and uncritical of israel .
while allowing interviewees to criticise the united states in terms that would seldom be seen on western tv screens , the channel has also carried long interviews with tony blair , condoleezza rice , donald rumsfeld and ariel sharon .
the channel has also got on the wrong side of several arab regimes .
its reporters have at times been banned or harassed in egypt , kuwait , jordan and the palestinian authority .
it has been criticised by saudi arabia and was according to al-jazeera described by bahrain as being pro-zionist .
in a timely coup , al-jazeera this week won a " freedom of expression " award for its general news coverage from index on censorship , an international group which campaigns against censorship .
amid the criticism they have been facing , defenders of the channel may see this as confirmation that al-jazeera is doing a job the western media is not and that the criticisms are an attempt to muzzle it .
