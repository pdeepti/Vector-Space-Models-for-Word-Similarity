sascha göpel , who played the forward who kicked the winning goal in a new film , recently spoke to deutsche welle . time was running out and west germany and hungary were tied at 2-2 .
german striker helmut rahn took a pass from his midfielder and managed to kick the ball past a maze of hungarian defenders safely into the goal , winning the 1954 world cup for his country in bern , switzerland .
led by rahn , the so-called " heroes of bern " entered the annals of german sports history as gods . " the miracle of bern " quickly assumed the dimensions of a legend in west germany .
it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .
but helmut rahn never got a chance to say what he thought of the film .
he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .
then i played for the youth team , and helmut rahn was the guest of honor at one of my club 's summer tournaments .
we were well briefed beforehand and knew exactly who helmut rahn was .
that was the only time i met him .
i did n't guess how significant the " miracle of bern " would be for me later . what did you know about helmut rahn before the film was shot ? helmut rahn went to school with my grandfather and lived in the same neighborhood .
so i know a lot of anecdotes , like how rahn switched from the club sportfreunden katernberg to rot-weiss essen for a motorcycle and a fence .
katernberg was n't allowed to charge entrance fees at home because the sports field was n't fenced in .
to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .
and then i also got to play a soccer hero .
that means a lot for someone who once wanted to be a professional soccer player .
plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .
i was scared stiff .
it had to look exactly as it had back then .
in later scenes i always had someone next to me who i could ask for help , like -lsb- director -rsb- sönke wortmann , -lsb- actors -rsb- peter lohmeyer or peter franke . how was it to meet former world champion player horst eckel ? it was very exciting .
horst eckel recounted what was going on in the national team back then , how the atmosphere was .
toni turek played the accordion in the team bus and the team sang along .
you could n't even imagine something like that now .
it was an entirely different generation . do you still have contact to the other actors who played on the german team ? yes , we do .
we meet up now and then .
after all , we did win the world cup together .
next weekend we 're even going to play as a team at a tournament in hamburg . sascha göpel was interviewed by peter wozny . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the " miracle of bern " a german soccer hero who shot the 1954 world cup winning goal that elevated a country humiliated by war has died .
fans of helmut rahn now have a newly-released film by which to remember the legend and his goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.10.2003 with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky : 35,000 high school graduates are still on the hunt for a traineeship industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .
companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand . tens of thousands of high school graduates face a shaky future in germany because they have been unable to find vocational training programs to give them the foundations they need to embark on careers in skilled labor . representatives from the government , industry and trade unions squared off on thursday to find solutions for the 35,000 young adults in search of vocational training .
the result was a short reprieve for employers , while they scramble to find positions for the waiting thousands by the end of the year .
otherwise , companies may be fined for not offering enough apprenticeships .
at least 20,200 traineeships are needed to meet the demand . “ it ’ s the proclaimed aim of our government to ensure that every school leaver gets an apprenticeship , " education minister edelgard buhlman said after the meeting .
" german industry has to react swiftly now .
we ’ ve decided that it will be given another period of grace .
but if we don ’ t see any tangible results in the weeks ahead , we ’ ll have to have some legislation to punish those who are not willing to offer apprenticeships .
this is exactly what chancellor gerhard schröder announced in his government declaration in march , and we ’ re prepared to push this through , should we not see an improvement soon . ” industry representatives agreed in the talks to invite " every individual " among the 35,000 high school graduates seeking apprenticeships for an interview .
but they insisted they were already doing their part to improve the situation .
only 20 to 40 percent of the young people who had been offered an interview previously had signaled interested , hans-eberhard schleyer of the german confederation of skilled crafts said . inflexible youth the president of the confederation of german employers ' association , dieter hundt , who refused to take part in the talks , has criticized young people for being too inflexible .
he pointed out that nearly 15,000 positions were currently available , and said young people apparently did n't want those jobs .
metal working , textiles and the insurance business still had many vacancies for vocational training , he added .
young people should also be willing to move to another part of the country to get a traineeship , he said . while it 's true that 95 percent of school leavers have found a position over the past year , only 47 percent got an apprenticeship within a company .
though another one-fifth enrolled in training courses , the majority got a job to bridge the time until they could find an apprenticeship . companies often complain that apprenticeships are too expensive , particularly given the sluggish german economy .
they also blame the educational system for producing school leavers who they say can hardly read or write and are difficult to properly train . time for action german trade union federation head michael sommer expressed little sympathy for industry 's complaints .
but he said he was unhappy with the government , too .
" i expect that something will be done now , " he said and called on the government to impose fines on companies that do n't provide apprenticeships . industry has until the end of the year to try to find positions for the school leavers seeking them .
then the issue of financial punishment could become a reality for firms that do n't offer traineeships . “ i ’ m not saying that every firm should be forced to offer apprenticeships , " apprentice-in-waiting jens rothenberg told deutsche welle .
" i realize that in the current economic situation it will be extremely hard for very small firms to do this .
but the bigger ones should not be left off the hook .
and if they don ’ t want to go the extra mile , they should be fined . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder gets tough on traineeship deficit german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.10.2003 with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the lucky : 35,000 high school graduates are still on the hunt for a traineeship industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .
companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand . tens of thousands of high school graduates face a shaky future in germany because they have been unable to find vocational training programs to give them the foundations they need to embark on careers in skilled labor . representatives from the government , industry and trade unions squared off on thursday to find solutions for the 35,000 young adults in search of vocational training .
the result was a short reprieve for employers , while they scramble to find positions for the waiting thousands by the end of the year .
otherwise , companies may be fined for not offering enough apprenticeships .
at least 20,200 traineeships are needed to meet the demand . “ it ’ s the proclaimed aim of our government to ensure that every school leaver gets an apprenticeship , " education minister edelgard buhlman said after the meeting .
" german industry has to react swiftly now .
we ’ ve decided that it will be given another period of grace .
but if we don ’ t see any tangible results in the weeks ahead , we ’ ll have to have some legislation to punish those who are not willing to offer apprenticeships .
this is exactly what chancellor gerhard schröder announced in his government declaration in march , and we ’ re prepared to push this through , should we not see an improvement soon . ” industry representatives agreed in the talks to invite " every individual " among the 35,000 high school graduates seeking apprenticeships for an interview .
but they insisted they were already doing their part to improve the situation .
only 20 to 40 percent of the young people who had been offered an interview previously had signaled interested , hans-eberhard schleyer of the german confederation of skilled crafts said . inflexible youth the president of the confederation of german employers ' association , dieter hundt , who refused to take part in the talks , has criticized young people for being too inflexible .
he pointed out that nearly 15,000 positions were currently available , and said young people apparently did n't want those jobs .
metal working , textiles and the insurance business still had many vacancies for vocational training , he added .
young people should also be willing to move to another part of the country to get a traineeship , he said . while it 's true that 95 percent of school leavers have found a position over the past year , only 47 percent got an apprenticeship within a company .
though another one-fifth enrolled in training courses , the majority got a job to bridge the time until they could find an apprenticeship . companies often complain that apprenticeships are too expensive , particularly given the sluggish german economy .
they also blame the educational system for producing school leavers who they say can hardly read or write and are difficult to properly train . time for action german trade union federation head michael sommer expressed little sympathy for industry 's complaints .
but he said he was unhappy with the government , too .
" i expect that something will be done now , " he said and called on the government to impose fines on companies that do n't provide apprenticeships . industry has until the end of the year to try to find positions for the school leavers seeking them .
then the issue of financial punishment could become a reality for firms that do n't offer traineeships . “ i ’ m not saying that every firm should be forced to offer apprenticeships , " apprentice-in-waiting jens rothenberg told deutsche welle .
" i realize that in the current economic situation it will be extremely hard for very small firms to do this .
but the bigger ones should not be left off the hook .
and if they don ’ t want to go the extra mile , they should be fined . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder gets tough on traineeship deficit german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo .

sascha göpel , who played the forward who kicked the winning goal in a new film , recently spoke to deutsche welle . time was running out and west germany and hungary were tied at 2-2 .
german striker helmut rahn took a pass from his midfielder and managed to kick the ball past a maze of hungarian defenders safely into the goal , winning the 1954 world cup for his country in bern , switzerland .
led by rahn , the so-called " heroes of bern " entered the annals of german sports history as gods . " the miracle of bern " quickly assumed the dimensions of a legend in west germany .
it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .

he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .

i did n't guess how significant the " miracle of bern " would be for me later . what did you know about helmut rahn before the film was shot ? helmut rahn went to school with my grandfather and lived in the same neighborhood .
so i know a lot of anecdotes , like how rahn switched from the club sportfreunden katernberg to rot-weiss essen for a motorcycle and a fence .
katernberg was n't allowed to charge entrance fees at home because the sports field was n't fenced in .
to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .

plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .
i was scared stiff .
it had to look exactly as it had back then .

sascha göpel , who played the forward who kicked the winning goal in a new film , recently spoke to deutsche welle . time was running out and west germany and hungary were tied at 2-2 .
german striker helmut rahn took a pass from his midfielder and managed to kick the ball past a maze of hungarian defenders safely into the goal , winning the 1954 world cup for his country in bern , switzerland .
led by rahn , the so-called " heroes of bern " entered the annals of german sports history as gods . " the miracle of bern " quickly assumed the dimensions of a legend in west germany .
it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .
but helmut rahn never got a chance to say what he thought of the film .
he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .
then i played for the youth team , and helmut rahn was the guest of honor at one of my club 's summer tournaments .

it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .
but helmut rahn never got a chance to say what he thought of the film .
he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .
then i played for the youth team , and helmut rahn was the guest of honor at one of my club 's summer tournaments .
we were well briefed beforehand and knew exactly who helmut rahn was .
that was the only time i met him .
i did n't guess how significant the " miracle of bern " would be for me later . what did you know about helmut rahn before the film was shot ? helmut rahn went to school with my grandfather and lived in the same neighborhood .
so i know a lot of anecdotes , like how rahn switched from the club sportfreunden katernberg to rot-weiss essen for a motorcycle and a fence .
katernberg was n't allowed to charge entrance fees at home because the sports field was n't fenced in .
to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .
and then i also got to play a soccer hero .
that means a lot for someone who once wanted to be a professional soccer player .
plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .
i was scared stiff .
it had to look exactly as it had back then .
in later scenes i always had someone next to me who i could ask for help , like -lsb- director -rsb- sönke wortmann , -lsb- actors -rsb- peter lohmeyer or peter franke . how was it to meet former world champion player horst eckel ? it was very exciting .
horst eckel recounted what was going on in the national team back then , how the atmosphere was .
toni turek played the accordion in the team bus and the team sang along .
you could n't even imagine something like that now .
it was an entirely different generation . do you still have contact to the other actors who played on the german team ? yes , we do .
we meet up now and then .
after all , we did win the world cup together .
next weekend we 're even going to play as a team at a tournament in hamburg . sascha göpel was interviewed by peter wozny . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the " miracle of bern " a german soccer hero who shot the 1954 world cup winning goal that elevated a country humiliated by war has died .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .

" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .
in a cover story earlier this year , respected german news magazine der spiegel suggested that u.s. policy , largely influenced by the oil industry and the religious right , was driven by a desire to control the world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .
the 55th frankfurt book fair could provide a badly needed boost to an industry in crisis .

the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .
more money would help the one measure that all education ministers agreed could provide a real trend reversal is money .
wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .

wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .

sascha göpel , who played the forward who kicked the winning goal in a new film , recently spoke to deutsche welle . time was running out and west germany and hungary were tied at 2-2 .
german striker helmut rahn took a pass from his midfielder and managed to kick the ball past a maze of hungarian defenders safely into the goal , winning the 1954 world cup for his country in bern , switzerland .
led by rahn , the so-called " heroes of bern " entered the annals of german sports history as gods . " the miracle of bern " quickly assumed the dimensions of a legend in west germany .
it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .
but helmut rahn never got a chance to say what he thought of the film .
he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .
then i played for the youth team , and helmut rahn was the guest of honor at one of my club 's summer tournaments .
we were well briefed beforehand and knew exactly who helmut rahn was .
that was the only time i met him .
i did n't guess how significant the " miracle of bern " would be for me later . what did you know about helmut rahn before the film was shot ? helmut rahn went to school with my grandfather and lived in the same neighborhood .
so i know a lot of anecdotes , like how rahn switched from the club sportfreunden katernberg to rot-weiss essen for a motorcycle and a fence .
katernberg was n't allowed to charge entrance fees at home because the sports field was n't fenced in .
to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .
and then i also got to play a soccer hero .
that means a lot for someone who once wanted to be a professional soccer player .
plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .
i was scared stiff .
it had to look exactly as it had back then .
in later scenes i always had someone next to me who i could ask for help , like -lsb- director -rsb- sönke wortmann , -lsb- actors -rsb- peter lohmeyer or peter franke . how was it to meet former world champion player horst eckel ? it was very exciting .
horst eckel recounted what was going on in the national team back then , how the atmosphere was .
toni turek played the accordion in the team bus and the team sang along .
you could n't even imagine something like that now .
it was an entirely different generation . do you still have contact to the other actors who played on the german team ? yes , we do .
we meet up now and then .
after all , we did win the world cup together .
next weekend we 're even going to play as a team at a tournament in hamburg . sascha göpel was interviewed by peter wozny . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the " miracle of bern " a german soccer hero who shot the 1954 world cup winning goal that elevated a country humiliated by war has died .

companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand . tens of thousands of high school graduates face a shaky future in germany because they have been unable to find vocational training programs to give them the foundations they need to embark on careers in skilled labor . representatives from the government , industry and trade unions squared off on thursday to find solutions for the 35,000 young adults in search of vocational training .
the result was a short reprieve for employers , while they scramble to find positions for the waiting thousands by the end of the year .

sascha göpel , who played the forward who kicked the winning goal in a new film , recently spoke to deutsche welle . time was running out and west germany and hungary were tied at 2-2 .
german striker helmut rahn took a pass from his midfielder and managed to kick the ball past a maze of hungarian defenders safely into the goal , winning the 1954 world cup for his country in bern , switzerland .
led by rahn , the so-called " heroes of bern " entered the annals of german sports history as gods . " the miracle of bern " quickly assumed the dimensions of a legend in west germany .
it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .
but helmut rahn never got a chance to say what he thought of the film .
he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .
then i played for the youth team , and helmut rahn was the guest of honor at one of my club 's summer tournaments .
we were well briefed beforehand and knew exactly who helmut rahn was .
that was the only time i met him .
i did n't guess how significant the " miracle of bern " would be for me later . what did you know about helmut rahn before the film was shot ? helmut rahn went to school with my grandfather and lived in the same neighborhood .
so i know a lot of anecdotes , like how rahn switched from the club sportfreunden katernberg to rot-weiss essen for a motorcycle and a fence .
katernberg was n't allowed to charge entrance fees at home because the sports field was n't fenced in .
to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .
and then i also got to play a soccer hero .
that means a lot for someone who once wanted to be a professional soccer player .
plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .
i was scared stiff .
it had to look exactly as it had back then .
in later scenes i always had someone next to me who i could ask for help , like -lsb- director -rsb- sönke wortmann , -lsb- actors -rsb- peter lohmeyer or peter franke . how was it to meet former world champion player horst eckel ? it was very exciting .
horst eckel recounted what was going on in the national team back then , how the atmosphere was .
toni turek played the accordion in the team bus and the team sang along .
you could n't even imagine something like that now .
it was an entirely different generation . do you still have contact to the other actors who played on the german team ? yes , we do .

companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand . tens of thousands of high school graduates face a shaky future in germany because they have been unable to find vocational training programs to give them the foundations they need to embark on careers in skilled labor . representatives from the government , industry and trade unions squared off on thursday to find solutions for the 35,000 young adults in search of vocational training .
the result was a short reprieve for employers , while they scramble to find positions for the waiting thousands by the end of the year .
otherwise , companies may be fined for not offering enough apprenticeships .
at least 20,200 traineeships are needed to meet the demand . “ it ’ s the proclaimed aim of our government to ensure that every school leaver gets an apprenticeship , " education minister edelgard buhlman said after the meeting .
" german industry has to react swiftly now .

he pointed out that nearly 15,000 positions were currently available , and said young people apparently did n't want those jobs .
metal working , textiles and the insurance business still had many vacancies for vocational training , he added .
young people should also be willing to move to another part of the country to get a traineeship , he said . while it 's true that 95 percent of school leavers have found a position over the past year , only 47 percent got an apprenticeship within a company .
though another one-fifth enrolled in training courses , the majority got a job to bridge the time until they could find an apprenticeship . companies often complain that apprenticeships are too expensive , particularly given the sluggish german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools germany moves to all-day schools germany -pipe- 10.10.2003 report lambastes german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing is on the board for germany 's education system .
the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .
more money would help the one measure that all education ministers agreed could provide a real trend reversal is money .
wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schools . -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .

" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .
in a cover story earlier this year , respected german news magazine der spiegel suggested that u.s. policy , largely influenced by the oil industry and the religious right , was driven by a desire to control the world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .
the 55th frankfurt book fair could provide a badly needed boost to an industry in crisis .

the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .

the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .

the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .
more money would help the one measure that all education ministers agreed could provide a real trend reversal is money .
wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .

companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand . tens of thousands of high school graduates face a shaky future in germany because they have been unable to find vocational training programs to give them the foundations they need to embark on careers in skilled labor . representatives from the government , industry and trade unions squared off on thursday to find solutions for the 35,000 young adults in search of vocational training .
the result was a short reprieve for employers , while they scramble to find positions for the waiting thousands by the end of the year .
otherwise , companies may be fined for not offering enough apprenticeships .
at least 20,200 traineeships are needed to meet the demand . “ it ’ s the proclaimed aim of our government to ensure that every school leaver gets an apprenticeship , " education minister edelgard buhlman said after the meeting .
" german industry has to react swiftly now .
we ’ ve decided that it will be given another period of grace .
but if we don ’ t see any tangible results in the weeks ahead , we ’ ll have to have some legislation to punish those who are not willing to offer apprenticeships .
this is exactly what chancellor gerhard schröder announced in his government declaration in march , and we ’ re prepared to push this through , should we not see an improvement soon . ” industry representatives agreed in the talks to invite " every individual " among the 35,000 high school graduates seeking apprenticeships for an interview .
but they insisted they were already doing their part to improve the situation .
only 20 to 40 percent of the young people who had been offered an interview previously had signaled interested , hans-eberhard schleyer of the german confederation of skilled crafts said . inflexible youth the president of the confederation of german employers ' association , dieter hundt , who refused to take part in the talks , has criticized young people for being too inflexible .
he pointed out that nearly 15,000 positions were currently available , and said young people apparently did n't want those jobs .
metal working , textiles and the insurance business still had many vacancies for vocational training , he added .
young people should also be willing to move to another part of the country to get a traineeship , he said . while it 's true that 95 percent of school leavers have found a position over the past year , only 47 percent got an apprenticeship within a company .
though another one-fifth enrolled in training courses , the majority got a job to bridge the time until they could find an apprenticeship . companies often complain that apprenticeships are too expensive , particularly given the sluggish german economy .
they also blame the educational system for producing school leavers who they say can hardly read or write and are difficult to properly train . time for action german trade union federation head michael sommer expressed little sympathy for industry 's complaints .
but he said he was unhappy with the government , too .
" i expect that something will be done now , " he said and called on the government to impose fines on companies that do n't provide apprenticeships . industry has until the end of the year to try to find positions for the school leavers seeking them .
then the issue of financial punishment could become a reality for firms that do n't offer traineeships . “ i ’ m not saying that every firm should be forced to offer apprenticeships , " apprentice-in-waiting jens rothenberg told deutsche welle .
" i realize that in the current economic situation it will be extremely hard for very small firms to do this .
but the bigger ones should not be left off the hook .
and if they don ’ t want to go the extra mile , they should be fined . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder gets tough on traineeship deficit german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo .

organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .
in a cover story earlier this year , respected german news magazine der spiegel suggested that u.s. policy , largely influenced by the oil industry and the religious right , was driven by a desire to control the world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .
the 55th frankfurt book fair could provide a badly needed boost to an industry in crisis .

sascha göpel , who played the forward who kicked the winning goal in a new film , recently spoke to deutsche welle . time was running out and west germany and hungary were tied at 2-2 .
german striker helmut rahn took a pass from his midfielder and managed to kick the ball past a maze of hungarian defenders safely into the goal , winning the 1954 world cup for his country in bern , switzerland .
led by rahn , the so-called " heroes of bern " entered the annals of german sports history as gods . " the miracle of bern " quickly assumed the dimensions of a legend in west germany .
it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .
but helmut rahn never got a chance to say what he thought of the film .
he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .
then i played for the youth team , and helmut rahn was the guest of honor at one of my club 's summer tournaments .
we were well briefed beforehand and knew exactly who helmut rahn was .
that was the only time i met him .
i did n't guess how significant the " miracle of bern " would be for me later . what did you know about helmut rahn before the film was shot ? helmut rahn went to school with my grandfather and lived in the same neighborhood .
so i know a lot of anecdotes , like how rahn switched from the club sportfreunden katernberg to rot-weiss essen for a motorcycle and a fence .
katernberg was n't allowed to charge entrance fees at home because the sports field was n't fenced in .
to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .
and then i also got to play a soccer hero .
that means a lot for someone who once wanted to be a professional soccer player .
plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .
i was scared stiff .
it had to look exactly as it had back then .
in later scenes i always had someone next to me who i could ask for help , like -lsb- director -rsb- sönke wortmann , -lsb- actors -rsb- peter lohmeyer or peter franke . how was it to meet former world champion player horst eckel ? it was very exciting .
horst eckel recounted what was going on in the national team back then , how the atmosphere was .
toni turek played the accordion in the team bus and the team sang along .
you could n't even imagine something like that now .
it was an entirely different generation . do you still have contact to the other actors who played on the german team ? yes , we do .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .
in a cover story earlier this year , respected german news magazine der spiegel suggested that u.s. policy , largely influenced by the oil industry and the religious right , was driven by a desire to control the world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .

companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand . tens of thousands of high school graduates face a shaky future in germany because they have been unable to find vocational training programs to give them the foundations they need to embark on careers in skilled labor . representatives from the government , industry and trade unions squared off on thursday to find solutions for the 35,000 young adults in search of vocational training .
the result was a short reprieve for employers , while they scramble to find positions for the waiting thousands by the end of the year .
otherwise , companies may be fined for not offering enough apprenticeships .
at least 20,200 traineeships are needed to meet the demand . “ it ’ s the proclaimed aim of our government to ensure that every school leaver gets an apprenticeship , " education minister edelgard buhlman said after the meeting .

he pointed out that nearly 15,000 positions were currently available , and said young people apparently did n't want those jobs .
metal working , textiles and the insurance business still had many vacancies for vocational training , he added .
young people should also be willing to move to another part of the country to get a traineeship , he said . while it 's true that 95 percent of school leavers have found a position over the past year , only 47 percent got an apprenticeship within a company .
though another one-fifth enrolled in training courses , the majority got a job to bridge the time until they could find an apprenticeship . companies often complain that apprenticeships are too expensive , particularly given the sluggish german economy .
they also blame the educational system for producing school leavers who they say can hardly read or write and are difficult to properly train . time for action german trade union federation head michael sommer expressed little sympathy for industry 's complaints .
but he said he was unhappy with the government , too .
" i expect that something will be done now , " he said and called on the government to impose fines on companies that do n't provide apprenticeships . industry has until the end of the year to try to find positions for the school leavers seeking them .

the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .
more money would help the one measure that all education ministers agreed could provide a real trend reversal is money .
wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .
more money would help the one measure that all education ministers agreed could provide a real trend reversal is money .
wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .
in a cover story earlier this year , respected german news magazine der spiegel suggested that u.s. policy , largely influenced by the oil industry and the religious right , was driven by a desire to control the world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .
the 55th frankfurt book fair could provide a badly needed boost to an industry in crisis .

the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .
more money would help the one measure that all education ministers agreed could provide a real trend reversal is money .
wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schools . -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .

companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand . tens of thousands of high school graduates face a shaky future in germany because they have been unable to find vocational training programs to give them the foundations they need to embark on careers in skilled labor . representatives from the government , industry and trade unions squared off on thursday to find solutions for the 35,000 young adults in search of vocational training .
the result was a short reprieve for employers , while they scramble to find positions for the waiting thousands by the end of the year .

companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand . tens of thousands of high school graduates face a shaky future in germany because they have been unable to find vocational training programs to give them the foundations they need to embark on careers in skilled labor . representatives from the government , industry and trade unions squared off on thursday to find solutions for the 35,000 young adults in search of vocational training .
the result was a short reprieve for employers , while they scramble to find positions for the waiting thousands by the end of the year .
otherwise , companies may be fined for not offering enough apprenticeships .
at least 20,200 traineeships are needed to meet the demand . “ it ’ s the proclaimed aim of our government to ensure that every school leaver gets an apprenticeship , " education minister edelgard buhlman said after the meeting .
" german industry has to react swiftly now .
we ’ ve decided that it will be given another period of grace .
but if we don ’ t see any tangible results in the weeks ahead , we ’ ll have to have some legislation to punish those who are not willing to offer apprenticeships .
this is exactly what chancellor gerhard schröder announced in his government declaration in march , and we ’ re prepared to push this through , should we not see an improvement soon . ” industry representatives agreed in the talks to invite " every individual " among the 35,000 high school graduates seeking apprenticeships for an interview .
but they insisted they were already doing their part to improve the situation .
only 20 to 40 percent of the young people who had been offered an interview previously had signaled interested , hans-eberhard schleyer of the german confederation of skilled crafts said . inflexible youth the president of the confederation of german employers ' association , dieter hundt , who refused to take part in the talks , has criticized young people for being too inflexible .
he pointed out that nearly 15,000 positions were currently available , and said young people apparently did n't want those jobs .
metal working , textiles and the insurance business still had many vacancies for vocational training , he added .
young people should also be willing to move to another part of the country to get a traineeship , he said . while it 's true that 95 percent of school leavers have found a position over the past year , only 47 percent got an apprenticeship within a company .
though another one-fifth enrolled in training courses , the majority got a job to bridge the time until they could find an apprenticeship . companies often complain that apprenticeships are too expensive , particularly given the sluggish german economy .
they also blame the educational system for producing school leavers who they say can hardly read or write and are difficult to properly train . time for action german trade union federation head michael sommer expressed little sympathy for industry 's complaints .
but he said he was unhappy with the government , too .
" i expect that something will be done now , " he said and called on the government to impose fines on companies that do n't provide apprenticeships . industry has until the end of the year to try to find positions for the school leavers seeking them .
then the issue of financial punishment could become a reality for firms that do n't offer traineeships . “ i ’ m not saying that every firm should be forced to offer apprenticeships , " apprentice-in-waiting jens rothenberg told deutsche welle .
" i realize that in the current economic situation it will be extremely hard for very small firms to do this .
but the bigger ones should not be left off the hook .
and if they don ’ t want to go the extra mile , they should be fined . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder gets tough on traineeship deficit german chancellor gerhard schröder has threatened companies with legal measures if they don ’ t hire more apprentices and help the many high school graduates currently in limbo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools germany moves to all-day schools germany -pipe- 10.10.2003 report lambastes german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing is on the board for germany 's education system .
the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .

the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.10.2003 reliving the ' miracle of bern ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scared stiff : sascha göpel played a legendary soccer hero in " the miracle of bern " elation swept through west germany when the country , humiliated by war , won the 1954 world cup .
sascha göpel , who played the forward who kicked the winning goal in a new film , recently spoke to deutsche welle . time was running out and west germany and hungary were tied at 2-2 .
german striker helmut rahn took a pass from his midfielder and managed to kick the ball past a maze of hungarian defenders safely into the goal , winning the 1954 world cup for his country in bern , switzerland .
led by rahn , the so-called " heroes of bern " entered the annals of german sports history as gods . " the miracle of bern " quickly assumed the dimensions of a legend in west germany .
it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .
but helmut rahn never got a chance to say what he thought of the film .
he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .
then i played for the youth team , and helmut rahn was the guest of honor at one of my club 's summer tournaments .
we were well briefed beforehand and knew exactly who helmut rahn was .
that was the only time i met him .
i did n't guess how significant the " miracle of bern " would be for me later . what did you know about helmut rahn before the film was shot ? helmut rahn went to school with my grandfather and lived in the same neighborhood .
so i know a lot of anecdotes , like how rahn switched from the club sportfreunden katernberg to rot-weiss essen for a motorcycle and a fence .
katernberg was n't allowed to charge entrance fees at home because the sports field was n't fenced in .
to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .
and then i also got to play a soccer hero .
that means a lot for someone who once wanted to be a professional soccer player .
plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .
i was scared stiff .
it had to look exactly as it had back then .
in later scenes i always had someone next to me who i could ask for help , like -lsb- director -rsb- sönke wortmann , -lsb- actors -rsb- peter lohmeyer or peter franke . how was it to meet former world champion player horst eckel ? it was very exciting .
horst eckel recounted what was going on in the national team back then , how the atmosphere was .
toni turek played the accordion in the team bus and the team sang along .
you could n't even imagine something like that now .
it was an entirely different generation . do you still have contact to the other actors who played on the german team ? yes , we do .
we meet up now and then .
after all , we did win the world cup together .
next weekend we 're even going to play as a team at a tournament in hamburg . sascha göpel was interviewed by peter wozny . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the " miracle of bern " a german soccer hero who shot the 1954 world cup winning goal that elevated a country humiliated by war has died .
fans of helmut rahn now have a newly-released film by which to remember the legend and his goal .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .
in a cover story earlier this year , respected german news magazine der spiegel suggested that u.s. policy , largely influenced by the oil industry and the religious right , was driven by a desire to control the world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .
the 55th frankfurt book fair could provide a badly needed boost to an industry in crisis .

companies may have pay up if they do n't satisfy demand . tens of thousands of high school graduates face a shaky future in germany because they have been unable to find vocational training programs to give them the foundations they need to embark on careers in skilled labor . representatives from the government , industry and trade unions squared off on thursday to find solutions for the 35,000 young adults in search of vocational training .
the result was a short reprieve for employers , while they scramble to find positions for the waiting thousands by the end of the year .
otherwise , companies may be fined for not offering enough apprenticeships .
at least 20,200 traineeships are needed to meet the demand . “ it ’ s the proclaimed aim of our government to ensure that every school leaver gets an apprenticeship , " education minister edelgard buhlman said after the meeting .

sascha göpel , who played the forward who kicked the winning goal in a new film , recently spoke to deutsche welle . time was running out and west germany and hungary were tied at 2-2 .
german striker helmut rahn took a pass from his midfielder and managed to kick the ball past a maze of hungarian defenders safely into the goal , winning the 1954 world cup for his country in bern , switzerland .
led by rahn , the so-called " heroes of bern " entered the annals of german sports history as gods . " the miracle of bern " quickly assumed the dimensions of a legend in west germany .
it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .
but helmut rahn never got a chance to say what he thought of the film .
he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .
then i played for the youth team , and helmut rahn was the guest of honor at one of my club 's summer tournaments .
we were well briefed beforehand and knew exactly who helmut rahn was .
that was the only time i met him .
i did n't guess how significant the " miracle of bern " would be for me later . what did you know about helmut rahn before the film was shot ? helmut rahn went to school with my grandfather and lived in the same neighborhood .
so i know a lot of anecdotes , like how rahn switched from the club sportfreunden katernberg to rot-weiss essen for a motorcycle and a fence .
katernberg was n't allowed to charge entrance fees at home because the sports field was n't fenced in .
to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .
and then i also got to play a soccer hero .
that means a lot for someone who once wanted to be a professional soccer player .
plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .
i was scared stiff .
it had to look exactly as it had back then .
in later scenes i always had someone next to me who i could ask for help , like -lsb- director -rsb- sönke wortmann , -lsb- actors -rsb- peter lohmeyer or peter franke . how was it to meet former world champion player horst eckel ? it was very exciting .
horst eckel recounted what was going on in the national team back then , how the atmosphere was .
toni turek played the accordion in the team bus and the team sang along .
you could n't even imagine something like that now .
it was an entirely different generation . do you still have contact to the other actors who played on the german team ? yes , we do .
we meet up now and then .
after all , we did win the world cup together .
next weekend we 're even going to play as a team at a tournament in hamburg . sascha göpel was interviewed by peter wozny . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the " miracle of bern " a german soccer hero who shot the 1954 world cup winning goal that elevated a country humiliated by war has died .

to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .
and then i also got to play a soccer hero .
that means a lot for someone who once wanted to be a professional soccer player .
plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .
i was scared stiff .
it had to look exactly as it had back then .
in later scenes i always had someone next to me who i could ask for help , like -lsb- director -rsb- sönke wortmann , -lsb- actors -rsb- peter lohmeyer or peter franke . how was it to meet former world champion player horst eckel ? it was very exciting .
horst eckel recounted what was going on in the national team back then , how the atmosphere was .
toni turek played the accordion in the team bus and the team sang along .
you could n't even imagine something like that now .
it was an entirely different generation . do you still have contact to the other actors who played on the german team ? yes , we do .
we meet up now and then .
after all , we did win the world cup together .
next weekend we 're even going to play as a team at a tournament in hamburg . sascha göpel was interviewed by peter wozny . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mourning the " miracle of bern " a german soccer hero who shot the 1954 world cup winning goal that elevated a country humiliated by war has died .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .
in a cover story earlier this year , respected german news magazine der spiegel suggested that u.s. policy , largely influenced by the oil industry and the religious right , was driven by a desire to control the world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .

the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .
more money would help the one measure that all education ministers agreed could provide a real trend reversal is money .
wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .

led by rahn , the so-called " heroes of bern " entered the annals of german sports history as gods . " the miracle of bern " quickly assumed the dimensions of a legend in west germany .
it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .
but helmut rahn never got a chance to say what he thought of the film .
he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .
then i played for the youth team , and helmut rahn was the guest of honor at one of my club 's summer tournaments .
we were well briefed beforehand and knew exactly who helmut rahn was .
that was the only time i met him .
i did n't guess how significant the " miracle of bern " would be for me later . what did you know about helmut rahn before the film was shot ? helmut rahn went to school with my grandfather and lived in the same neighborhood .
so i know a lot of anecdotes , like how rahn switched from the club sportfreunden katernberg to rot-weiss essen for a motorcycle and a fence .
katernberg was n't allowed to charge entrance fees at home because the sports field was n't fenced in .
to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .
and then i also got to play a soccer hero .
that means a lot for someone who once wanted to be a professional soccer player .
plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .
i was scared stiff .
it had to look exactly as it had back then .
in later scenes i always had someone next to me who i could ask for help , like -lsb- director -rsb- sönke wortmann , -lsb- actors -rsb- peter lohmeyer or peter franke . how was it to meet former world champion player horst eckel ? it was very exciting .
horst eckel recounted what was going on in the national team back then , how the atmosphere was .
toni turek played the accordion in the team bus and the team sang along .
you could n't even imagine something like that now .
it was an entirely different generation . do you still have contact to the other actors who played on the german team ? yes , we do .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .
in a cover story earlier this year , respected german news magazine der spiegel suggested that u.s. policy , largely influenced by the oil industry and the religious right , was driven by a desire to control the world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.10.2003 9/11 conspiracy theory books dominate debate at frankfurt book fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 9/11 conspiracy theories are doing the rounds at the frankfurt book fair .
at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .
in a cover story earlier this year , respected german news magazine der spiegel suggested that u.s. policy , largely influenced by the oil industry and the religious right , was driven by a desire to control the world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .

the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .
more money would help the one measure that all education ministers agreed could provide a real trend reversal is money .
wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .

the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .
more money would help the one measure that all education ministers agreed could provide a real trend reversal is money .
wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .
in a cover story earlier this year , respected german news magazine der spiegel suggested that u.s. policy , largely influenced by the oil industry and the religious right , was driven by a desire to control the world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .
the 55th frankfurt book fair could provide a badly needed boost to an industry in crisis .

the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .
more money would help the one measure that all education ministers agreed could provide a real trend reversal is money .
wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .
-lrb- by comparison , the united states ranked as the heaviest investor in education , with 7 percent of its gdp earmarked for schools . -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de with clock ticking , industry extends olive branch industry promises to invite each and every school leaver in search of an apprenticeship for an interview .

wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .
more money would help the one measure that all education ministers agreed could provide a real trend reversal is money .
wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms germany to introduce federal school standards bad grades for german schools germany moves to all-day schools germany -pipe- 10.10.2003 report lambastes german schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing is on the board for germany 's education system .
the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .

the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .

sascha göpel , who played the forward who kicked the winning goal in a new film , recently spoke to deutsche welle . time was running out and west germany and hungary were tied at 2-2 .
german striker helmut rahn took a pass from his midfielder and managed to kick the ball past a maze of hungarian defenders safely into the goal , winning the 1954 world cup for his country in bern , switzerland .
led by rahn , the so-called " heroes of bern " entered the annals of german sports history as gods . " the miracle of bern " quickly assumed the dimensions of a legend in west germany .
it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .
but helmut rahn never got a chance to say what he thought of the film .
he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .
then i played for the youth team , and helmut rahn was the guest of honor at one of my club 's summer tournaments .
we were well briefed beforehand and knew exactly who helmut rahn was .
that was the only time i met him .
i did n't guess how significant the " miracle of bern " would be for me later . what did you know about helmut rahn before the film was shot ? helmut rahn went to school with my grandfather and lived in the same neighborhood .
so i know a lot of anecdotes , like how rahn switched from the club sportfreunden katernberg to rot-weiss essen for a motorcycle and a fence .
katernberg was n't allowed to charge entrance fees at home because the sports field was n't fenced in .
to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .
and then i also got to play a soccer hero .
that means a lot for someone who once wanted to be a professional soccer player .
plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .
i was scared stiff .
it had to look exactly as it had back then .
in later scenes i always had someone next to me who i could ask for help , like -lsb- director -rsb- sönke wortmann , -lsb- actors -rsb- peter lohmeyer or peter franke . how was it to meet former world champion player horst eckel ? it was very exciting .
horst eckel recounted what was going on in the national team back then , how the atmosphere was .
toni turek played the accordion in the team bus and the team sang along .
you could n't even imagine something like that now .
it was an entirely different generation . do you still have contact to the other actors who played on the german team ? yes , we do .

sascha göpel , who played the forward who kicked the winning goal in a new film , recently spoke to deutsche welle . time was running out and west germany and hungary were tied at 2-2 .
german striker helmut rahn took a pass from his midfielder and managed to kick the ball past a maze of hungarian defenders safely into the goal , winning the 1954 world cup for his country in bern , switzerland .
led by rahn , the so-called " heroes of bern " entered the annals of german sports history as gods . " the miracle of bern " quickly assumed the dimensions of a legend in west germany .
it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .
but helmut rahn never got a chance to say what he thought of the film .
he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .
then i played for the youth team , and helmut rahn was the guest of honor at one of my club 's summer tournaments .
we were well briefed beforehand and knew exactly who helmut rahn was .
that was the only time i met him .
i did n't guess how significant the " miracle of bern " would be for me later . what did you know about helmut rahn before the film was shot ? helmut rahn went to school with my grandfather and lived in the same neighborhood .
so i know a lot of anecdotes , like how rahn switched from the club sportfreunden katernberg to rot-weiss essen for a motorcycle and a fence .
katernberg was n't allowed to charge entrance fees at home because the sports field was n't fenced in .
to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .
and then i also got to play a soccer hero .
that means a lot for someone who once wanted to be a professional soccer player .
plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .

sascha göpel , who played the forward who kicked the winning goal in a new film , recently spoke to deutsche welle . time was running out and west germany and hungary were tied at 2-2 .
german striker helmut rahn took a pass from his midfielder and managed to kick the ball past a maze of hungarian defenders safely into the goal , winning the 1954 world cup for his country in bern , switzerland .
led by rahn , the so-called " heroes of bern " entered the annals of german sports history as gods . " the miracle of bern " quickly assumed the dimensions of a legend in west germany .
it was the first time germany had held the title of soccer world champion , and it came at a time when the devastated and depressed country was in dire need of bucking up , less than a decade after the end of world war ii . now german director sönke wortmann has turned one of the highpoints in german sports history into a film , named after the colloquial title for the world cup win , " the miracle of bern . "
the movie focuses on 11-year-old matthias , who finds a surrogate for his father in local football hero helmut rahn .
the return of his real father from a soviet prisoner-of-war camp alienates the boy .
father and son rediscover their affections for each other with the help of rahn and the german national team that bring home victory in bern . wortmann auditioned 1,500 men who had to both look similar to the 1954 german team players and show significant soccer experience .
the film debuted at the locarno film festival this year and was lauded by film critics and soccer fans alike .
but helmut rahn never got a chance to say what he thought of the film .
he died in august without seeing it . in an interview with deutsche welle , actor sascha göpel , who played helmut rahn , described his experiences making the film . when did you first hear about the " miracle of bern ? " when i was ten .
then i played for the youth team , and helmut rahn was the guest of honor at one of my club 's summer tournaments .
we were well briefed beforehand and knew exactly who helmut rahn was .
that was the only time i met him .
i did n't guess how significant the " miracle of bern " would be for me later . what did you know about helmut rahn before the film was shot ? helmut rahn went to school with my grandfather and lived in the same neighborhood .
so i know a lot of anecdotes , like how rahn switched from the club sportfreunden katernberg to rot-weiss essen for a motorcycle and a fence .
katernberg was n't allowed to charge entrance fees at home because the sports field was n't fenced in .
to get rahn to switch to rot-weiss essen , the president of rot-weiss paid for a fence . how did you get the role ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut rahn celebrates after tying the score on a corner kick by teammate fritz walter in the world cup final against hungary on july 4 , 1954 .
a friend called me up in the middle of the night because she had heard about a casting call for a soccer film .
that was all she knew .
she gave me the production company 's telephone number and i called them the very next day .
it was my second year at acting school - i was a total nobody .
besides , the application deadline for the casting session had already passed .
but i bugged them so much that they finally invited me to come . how did you prepare for the role ? since helmut rahn 's health was very shaky a meeting was impossible .
so i talked to his contemporaries , first my grandparents but also former rot-weiss essen players .
in addition , i did a lot of research in year books and club chronicles and i read rahn 's biography . what do you have in common ? we 're both from essen , we both grew up here , and we both played for rot-weiss essen .
maybe we are also connected by a fundamental enthusiasm , a ' yes ' feeling towards life , a positive attitude .
fritz walter kept talking about how helmut rahn came up with the craziest things and always livened things up . what would you have asked helmut rahn if you had met him again ? i would n't have asked him about the 3-2 -lrb- shooting the winning goal -rrb- because the poor man had to answer the question around six billion times during his life .
instead , i would have asked him how it was to be part of a legend . what did it mean to you to play the boss ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from " the miracle of bern " it was the absolute dream role , since i was able to perfectly combine my passion for soccer with my profession as an actor .
and then i also got to play a soccer hero .
that means a lot for someone who once wanted to be a professional soccer player .
plus , i 'm from essen and helmut rahn is the city 's hero . what was most difficult during the filming ? -lsb- kicking -rsb- the 3-2 .
i was scared stiff .
it had to look exactly as it had back then .
in later scenes i always had someone next to me who i could ask for help , like -lsb- director -rsb- sönke wortmann , -lsb- actors -rsb- peter lohmeyer or peter franke . how was it to meet former world champion player horst eckel ? it was very exciting .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .
in a cover story earlier this year , respected german news magazine der spiegel suggested that u.s. policy , largely influenced by the oil industry and the religious right , was driven by a desire to control the world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .
the 55th frankfurt book fair could provide a badly needed boost to an industry in crisis .

at the frankfurt book fair , 9/11 conspiracy theory books are a hot topic of conversation .
and three books - all by german authors - are topping the country 's bestseller list .
why are the works such a focus of interest ? at this year 's frankfurt book fair , the world 's largest gathering of publishers , editors and writers , everyone 's talking about 9/11 conspiracy theory books .
organizers may have highlighted russia as the official country of this year 's conference , but it 's the united states - particularly its role in 9/11 - that has captured the popular imagination . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von bülow 's the cia and september 11 three books , all by german authors currently topping the german bestseller list , are conspiracy theory accounts about 9/11 .
perhaps the most famous of the bunch is written by andreas von bülow entitled the cia and september 11 -lrb- photo -rrb- . a former government minister of research and technology , von bülow suggests that u.s. and israeli intelligence services blew up the world trade center from the inside and that the two planes were flown in by remote control . why ?
this , quite obviously to von bülow , was part of a plot by the neoconservatives to give the bush administration the necessary cover to launch an attack against iraq and , ultimately , take over the world . perhaps von bülow could be dismissed as a one-off crack-pot , if there were n't so many others peddling similar tales of deleterious intent .
von bülow is joined by fellow authors mathias bröckner and gerhard wisnewski .
wisnewski , in his book operation 9/11 , also believes that the towers were toppled using explosives , and bröckner , in conspiracies , conspiracy theories and the secrets of september 11th , offers , as the title suggests , a similar catalogue of such notions . profits driving publishing buzz clearly , writers making such allegations are open to criticism .
and the best means of isolating themselves from attack would be to rely on iron-clad sources and systematically substantiate each and every one of their claims .
yet , these books largely rely on dubious sources , and that is why they have become a subject of debate at this year 's book fair .
editors are not only debating the validity of the claims made by von bülow and friends , but they are debating whether the publishing industry is doing itself a disservice by distributing work based on questionable reporting . klaus stadler , the editor of piper publishers , which published von bulow 's book , knew his company would face criticism .
" we told ourselves that we would take it seriously , but we do not feel obligated to independently check each and every detail , " stadler told deutsche welle .
" and my own personal position is that mr. von bülow poses a number of very interesting and important questions .
the answers to these questions should be weighed by responsible readers , who should take time to consider them .
we do n't want to patronize people . " others , however , who have observed the german book industry of late , believe that the drive to increase profits is what has prompted publishers to accept and distribute such books .
they are likely to sell , and in a competitive market - 90,000 new titles appear every year - publishers must take on ever more spectacular tomes in an effort to gain an edge over their competitors . " the pressure to be successful has increased , " christoph heimann , from german bookstore börsenblatt said . " and that might help explain why some books that are appearing today might not have appeared five or six years ago - or at least not so quickly . " conspiracy theories finding increasing takers ? but it 's not just the publishers who have shown interest in the conspiracy theory books . a recent poll published in german weekly newspaper die zeit , found one in five germans believe bush orchestrated 9/11 as a pretext to further his aims of world domination . in some ways , these books are not entirely out of the ordinary in germany .
they are simply an extreme example of books and journalism critical of the u.s. government , which increasingly resonates with the german public .
michael moore 's stupid white men , a biting criticism of the bush administration , has enjoyed great success . german editorials and magazines too have hinted that a sinister plot - though perhaps not so malefic as suggested by von bülow - is behind the bush administration 's foreign policy .
in a cover story earlier this year , respected german news magazine der spiegel suggested that u.s. policy , largely influenced by the oil industry and the religious right , was driven by a desire to control the world . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .
the 55th frankfurt book fair could provide a badly needed boost to an industry in crisis .

the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints . the much-awaited national education report drawn up by the top education officials of germany ’ s 16 states and released on friday in darmstadt contained few surprises .
the document did deliver a damning verdict for the country ’ s education system , but it essentially reiterated the conclusions drawn by a report by the office of economic cooperation and development and the 2000 international pisa education comparison - that germany ’ s education system is outmoded , overburdened and desperately in need of an overhaul .
bloated classrooms and few computers friday ’ s report warned of " grave erroneous trends " in the school system and pinpointed a host of problems that had cropped up as a result of years of faulty education policies .
they included classrooms that are much too large in international comparison , outdated school textbooks , a paucity of computers and teaching methods that rarely encourage talent or outstanding students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authors also pointed to the rising number of school drop-outs , a shrinking graduation rate and too little individual attention for students from poor and immigrant families .
the report cautioned that germany couldn ’ t afford " this waste of human potential " in face of a rapidly declining birth rate and said that discontent was rising among the population about school standards .
the education researchers commissioned with drawing up the report also criticized the fact that students in germany often began too late with targeted learning and spent too much time in educational establishments , where they hardly received any constructive encouragement .
" these are hardly beneficial prerequisites for achieving challenging education goals , " the report said .
the researchers also warned that it had become difficult to recognize any kind of unified german school system amidst a bewildering plethora of timetables , lessons and curriculums across the country .
report not the first wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin wolff karin wolff -lrb- photo -rrb- , education minister of the state of hesse and chairwoman of the state-level education officials ’ working group emphasized on friday that the results of the report weren ’ t that startling .
" this is not something that has suddenly been thrust upon us in a new brutal form , " she said and added that germany ’ s miserable performance on the international pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- in 2000 had already hinted at the full extent of the underlying failings of the education system .
at the time 15-year-old students in germany ranked 25th out of 32 countries in overall reading , mathematics and scientific literacy on the test .
wolff pointed out that education officials had already begun taking steps earlier this year to draw up national education standards that would establish a minimum level of performance for a student at a certain age .
the move has been prompted by germany ’ s complicated education structure whereby each state sets its own agenda and guidelines when it comes to framing education policy .
as a result , school grades , certificates and assessment tests vary greatly .
wolff also stressed that the new attempt to create national education standards had led to the implementation of routine comparison tests in schools nationally to ascertain the level of pupils ' knowledge . in addition , concerted programs have been initiated to fill the additional needs of children from migrant families and to bring their german-language skills up to the level they need to study successfully here .
no panacea for ailing schools despite modest progress in acting upon the wake-up call of the pisa report , state education officials admitted there isn ’ t any surefire cure for germany ’ s education woes .
proffered solutions include " comprehensive measures " when it comes to reinforcing the implementation of national education standards , raising the number of high school graduates , early attempts at promoting german especially among students from migrant families , better networking of kindergartens and primary schools , introduction of all-day schools and regular teacher training programs .
more money would help the one measure that all education ministers agreed could provide a real trend reversal is money .
wolff said that the present education woes could be countered if education was made a priority in states ’ policymaking .
that would require sparing funds allocated for education from the deep cuts that have become rampant in state budgets as coffers dry up and germany ’ s economic malaise puts a freeze on spending .
a separate oecd report published last month found that investment in germany 's educational establishments is , despite federal reform efforts , still far behind that of the oecd aggregate .
germany 's education expenditures amount to 5.3 percent of its gross domestic product , compared to an oecd average of 5.5 percent .

" a lot of people think the teachings of islam make them confrontative -lrb- sic -rrb- , but in fact , if you go to the fundamentals of islam , we are urged to live in peace , " he said .
he said that in this " true sense " , he considers himself a " fundamentalist " muslim .
dr mahathir , 78 , is due to retire at the end of october after 22 years in office , making him south east asia 's longest-serving elected leader .
the malaysian premier was responding to callers and emails from all over the world in an interactive interview he gave to the bbc 's talking point programme at his office in kuala lumpur .
he appealed to muslims worldwide to go back to the " original , true teachings of islam " and embrace values such as " peace , friendship , brotherhood , and tolerance of people " .
mahathir bows out in his own words economic legacy profile malaysia , he said , did not have a problem with islamic militants because it had acted to stop the " teaching of the politics of hatred " in religious schools .
" we are very vigilant and know what is happening , " he said , adding that the country 's tough internal security act had not been passed " just for fun " .
at the same time , he added , there was a " clash of civilisations " between islamic and other states .
" it is a lack of understanding of islam that has led to this present situation , " he said .
but he admitted that there was a problem within islam with " wrong " interpretations of islamic teachings .
" the result is that islam appears to be an obstruction to progress , " he said , adding that he believed there was a need for better unity within the muslim world .

" you can not force us to accept your values , " he said , comparing malaysia to britain .
asked about iraq , he said continuing attacks on us troops showed they were not welcome there .
malaysia 's future as his time in office approaches its end , dr mahathir also commented on other issues affecting his own country , from relations between ethnic malays and ethnic chinese to the prosecution of his former deputy prime minister , anwar ibrahim .
after one caller accused malaysia of treating its minority communities as " second-class citizens " , the premier said that malays felt oppressed by " rich chinese " .
" malays feel they are second-class people to rich chinese - both are second-class , " he said .
" there are no first-class . "
on anwar ibrahim , dr mahathir said he had not put him in jail himself - the courts had .
" you can not go around sodomising people , " he remarked , referring to one of the charges laid against his former deputy and rival .

pixar 's success story begins back in 1995 , when it released toy story which revolutionised animation at a stroke - and turned its makers into the pioneers of a new way of cartooning .
eight years later , pixar 's reputation as the midas of animation looks in no danger of disappearing .
the us box office charts have in 2003 been ruled not by keanu and co 's overblown matrix sequel , nor by governor schwarzenegger 's latest turn as the terminator cyborg , but rather a heartwarming tale of a fish 's search for his stolen son .
finding nemo , pixar 's latest offering , made more than $ 70m -lrb- £ 44.8m -rrb- on its opening weekend in the us in june .
it has since gone on to make more than $ 335m -lrb- £ 214m -rrb- in the us alone by the end of september .
pixar have the enviable reputation of having a hit with every film they have made - toy story , a bug 's life -lrb- 1998 -rrb- , toy story 2 -lrb- 1999 -rrb- , monsters , inc -lrb- 2001 -rrb- and finding nemo .
it is a situation few other hollywood studios can ever have related to .
but it is not just down to the films and their outlandish characters .
renderman , pixar 's software for taking computer-animated footage and dropping it seamlessly into live action , has been used in a wealth of recent blockbusters , such as the first two lord of the rings instalments , the harry potter films , and pearl harbor .
pixar began 18 years ago , when animator john lasseter left his job at disney to join the computer department of lucasfilm , the company run by star wars creator george lucas .
a year later , the company was bought by steve jobs , the co-founder of apple .
the new company was christened pixar .
jobs , lasseter and computer graphic expert ed catmull initially concentrated on making software .
but soon they were making shorts and commercials , using film-makers andrew stanton and pete docter .
the shorts the company made in the 1980s and early 90s paved the way for the big screen gems to follow .
first there was luxo jr , a short film about father-and-son desk lamps .
it earned a best animated short animation prize at the 1987 oscars .
a year later and tin toy , the story of a baby that causes mayhem to its collection of toys was made .
the shorts were taxing , complicated labours of love .
four minutes of screen time - the length of the pixar 's chess caper geri 's game , could take computers two years to animate properly .
but pixar became a true sensation in 1995 with the release of toy story - which was partly funded by the cartoon giant disney .
it tapped into lasseter 's unabashed love of toys .
like tin toy , it was set in a world where toys came to life , and revolved around favourite toy cowboy woody -lrb- voiced by tom hanks -rrb- and his paranoia over a new pretender , the blissfully ignorant spaceman buzz -lrb- tim allen -rrb- .
this was not simply a computer-generated copy of its bigger partner 's films - toy story had pop culture references to keep adults amused while children revelled in its day-glo daydream of toys coming to life .
this was one of pixar 's essential hallmarks .
lassetter and his team created characters full of foibles and faults , but much more empathetic than the usual cast of cartoon favourites .
strong stories - and some rather complex themes - were staples of the pixar structure .
armed with a cheeky sense of humour and wisecracking style , it was no wonder that the pixar films seemed pioneering .
suddenly , animated film-makers were having to throw away the rule book and look at how pixar was doing things .
pioneers toy story quickly made more than $ 320m -lrb- £ 205m -rrb- around the world , and was the highest-grossing film of the year in the us .
at the same time , pixar became a public company , raising more than $ 140m -lrb- £ 89.7m -rrb- to become the biggest ipo of the year - a company that has floated on the stock market .
this was not just down to their big-screen success .
all the time they were making short films and computer-animated tv adverts , they were also pioneering computer software .
pixar 's success led to a raft of imitations by disney and dreamworks .
the latter released the insect cartoon antz in 1998 only to find its thunder stolen by pixar 's a bug 's life .
edgy shrek , ice age , jimmy neutron : boy genius and final fantasy : the spirits within are other big-budget animated films that have appeared in pixar 's slipstream .
as the company prepares for a decade making features , the only credible criticism coming its way is that finding nemo is perhaps not as edgy as their earlier films .
given that pixar 's ed catmull once said to the los angeles times that steve jobs ' edict was that the company " should never be safe " , it is an odds-on bet pixar have got an answer for that too .
