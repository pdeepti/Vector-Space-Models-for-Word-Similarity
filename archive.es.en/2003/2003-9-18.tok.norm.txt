german chancellor gerhard schröder will fly next week to new york for a meeting of the united nations general assembly .
while there he will also attend festivities celebrating 30 years of german membership at the u.n. schröder will use his trip to reaffirm germany ’ s commitment to strengthening the united nations ’ role in resolving international conflicts .
but he will also take time to meet u.s. president george bush in an attempt to patch up german-american ties so badly damaged by disagreement over the war in iraq . though thursday will officially mark the 30th anniversary of german membership at the united nations , the party sponsored by the german u.n. mission won ’ t take place at new york ’ s swanky grand hyatt hotel until after schröder arrives on september 23 .
considering how dramatically germany ’ s role at the world forum has changed over the past three decades , most observers would agree there ’ s something to celebrate . membership delayed currently a high-profile rotating member of the u.n. security council , war-torn germany was not even considered for membership when the united nations was founded in 1945 .
the ensuing division of the country then delayed the process by some 20 years as west and east germany fought over international recognition .
only after west germany gave up its demand to be the only legitimate representative of the german people , did both nations become full members of the u.n. general assembly on september 18 , 1973 . only a few days later german foreign minster walter scheel addressed the issue that had keep west germany as nation with only “ active non-member ” status for so many years in his first speech at the united nations . “ do you understand why we hesitated to join the united nations ?
it is painful to look the political division of your own land in the eye , ” scheel said .
“ we feared that such a step would create the impression that we were resigned .
as if we had given up hope for unification . ” after unification in 1990 , the two german seats became one and modern germany began to orient its u.n. polices less on cold war realities and more on human rights , development and the peaceful resolution of conflicts .

as germany began to redefine its postwar role anew , it eventually came the watershed decision that german soldiers could once again be deployed abroad for peacekeeping missions that had u.n. backing .
in little over ten years , germany has taken part in operations in somalia , the balkans and afghanistan . although all but the most extreme pacifistic german parliamentarians now appear comfortable sending german troops overseas under a u.n. mandate , germany ’ s steadfast belief in using the world body to resolve international conflicts has created problems for the country ’ s once strong relations with the united states . angry america last year , chancellor schröder angered u.n. skeptic bush by saying germany would not support a u.n. resolution backing military action to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein no matter what .
as a rotating member of the security council , germany may not have a veto like permanent seat-holders such as france or russia , but schröder ’ s unyielding opposition left little room for diplomatic maneuver , likely emboldening other war opponents . “ germany without a doubt gained stature through its behavior during the iraq conflict , ” one high-ranking western diplomat told the german news agency dpa .
but at the same time , berlin ’ s newfound independence has also likely encouraged washington to put the kibosh on germany getting its own permanent seat on the security council for the foreseeable future . but such long-term german goals are likely not even on the agenda during schröder ’ s trip .
instead , he will be more concerned with showing bush that germany can still be america ’ s friend even if the two countries don ’ t always agree on every issue .

it could contain revelations about his role in a slush fund scandal . helmut kohl and marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive center , crossed swords again on wednesday in berlin ’ s higher administrative court .
this time birthler won . for years now , the former german chancellor and the head of the authority that administers secret police files from the former east germany have locked horns over whether journalists and researchers should be given access to material compiled by stasi agents who spied on kohl during his 16 administration .
in 2001 , a german federal administrative court in karlsruhe ruled that kohl ’ s file must remain under seal because its release would violate his privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl however , the berlin court ruled on wednesday that kohl ’ s 7,000 page file should be made public based on an amendment to the federal law governing access to the stasi archive passed last year .
the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .
in other words , we won ’ t obtain full clarity on the issue any time soon , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the authority that administers the stasi files indeed , kohl 's lawyers said the former chancellor would appeal the ruling .
kohl has made it clear he is prepared to pursue the issue at the highest judicial level , the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
kohl and his lawyers contend the ban on releasing personal data should be upheld and that the recent legal changes are unconstitutional .
" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .
a smoking gun ?
kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the court 's ruling against kohl is upheld , the decision would have sweeping implications .
until now , investigations into the stasi archives have largely been restricted to uncovering informants from the former east .
the focus has recently shifted to unmasking west german spies who worked for the east german secret police - a development that some fear could uncover explosive revelations about prominent germans if they are unable to block access to their files .
but another ruling in favor of kohl would also face criticism , since it could exacerbate rifts between east and west in a country still trying to come to terms with its recent history .
many eastern germans argue that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans who were spied on by the stasi and who , after reunification , were embarrassed by stasi file revelations long hidden in the archives .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will fly next week to new york for a meeting of the united nations general assembly .
while there he will also attend festivities celebrating 30 years of german membership at the u.n. schröder will use his trip to reaffirm germany ’ s commitment to strengthening the united nations ’ role in resolving international conflicts .
but he will also take time to meet u.s. president george bush in an attempt to patch up german-american ties so badly damaged by disagreement over the war in iraq . though thursday will officially mark the 30th anniversary of german membership at the united nations , the party sponsored by the german u.n. mission won ’ t take place at new york ’ s swanky grand hyatt hotel until after schröder arrives on september 23 .
considering how dramatically germany ’ s role at the world forum has changed over the past three decades , most observers would agree there ’ s something to celebrate . membership delayed currently a high-profile rotating member of the u.n. security council , war-torn germany was not even considered for membership when the united nations was founded in 1945 .
the ensuing division of the country then delayed the process by some 20 years as west and east germany fought over international recognition .
only after west germany gave up its demand to be the only legitimate representative of the german people , did both nations become full members of the u.n. general assembly on september 18 , 1973 . only a few days later german foreign minster walter scheel addressed the issue that had keep west germany as nation with only “ active non-member ” status for so many years in his first speech at the united nations . “ do you understand why we hesitated to join the united nations ?
it is painful to look the political division of your own land in the eye , ” scheel said .
“ we feared that such a step would create the impression that we were resigned .
as if we had given up hope for unification . ” after unification in 1990 , the two german seats became one and modern germany began to orient its u.n. polices less on cold war realities and more on human rights , development and the peaceful resolution of conflicts .
the third largest u.n. donor following the united states and japan , germany now accounts for roughly ten percent of the u.n. budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in kabul , afghanistan .
as germany began to redefine its postwar role anew , it eventually came the watershed decision that german soldiers could once again be deployed abroad for peacekeeping missions that had u.n. backing .
in little over ten years , germany has taken part in operations in somalia , the balkans and afghanistan . although all but the most extreme pacifistic german parliamentarians now appear comfortable sending german troops overseas under a u.n. mandate , germany ’ s steadfast belief in using the world body to resolve international conflicts has created problems for the country ’ s once strong relations with the united states . angry america last year , chancellor schröder angered u.n. skeptic bush by saying germany would not support a u.n. resolution backing military action to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein no matter what .
as a rotating member of the security council , germany may not have a veto like permanent seat-holders such as france or russia , but schröder ’ s unyielding opposition left little room for diplomatic maneuver , likely emboldening other war opponents . “ germany without a doubt gained stature through its behavior during the iraq conflict , ” one high-ranking western diplomat told the german news agency dpa .
but at the same time , berlin ’ s newfound independence has also likely encouraged washington to put the kibosh on germany getting its own permanent seat on the security council for the foreseeable future . but such long-term german goals are likely not even on the agenda during schröder ’ s trip .
instead , he will be more concerned with showing bush that germany can still be america ’ s friend even if the two countries don ’ t always agree on every issue .
for his part , bush will hope he can get schröder to support a new u.n. resolution that would pave the way for more international participation in stabilizing iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign minsters fail to reach agreement on iraq 's future divided foreign ministers of the five permanent u.n. security council member countries ended a crucial meeting in geneva saturday with no major breakthrough on talks for international support for the u.s. in iraq .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .

career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term although the netherlands has n't even formally proposed jaap de hoop scheffer for nato secretary-general , the cards seem to be falling the foreign minister 's way .
nato insiders in brussels on wednesday confirmed a german newspaper report that alleged the dutch diplomat was the top candidate to lead the north atlantic alliance after the current head , the scot george robertson , completes his term in mid-december . the united states in particular is expected to support de hoop scheffer 's nomination .
the netherlands shored up washington in the iraq war .
" if it had been up to him the dutch would not only have bolstered -lsb- the americans -rsb- politically but also militarily , " the dutch de volkskrant newspaper recently wrote . canada and france , however , are still thought to have reservations about de hoop scheffer .
canada has put in its own bid , finance minister john manley , a former foreign minister , who is regarded as the only real competition since norwegian defense minister kristin krohn devold announced she would not pursue the top nato position last week . a european edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels but jaap de hoop scheffer has a strong edge over manley : he 's european .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2003 court allows release of kohl 's stasi file großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's lawyers : prepared to take the case to the highest level a berlin court ruled on wednesday that former chancellor helmut kohl 's stasi file could be released to researchers .
it could contain revelations about his role in a slush fund scandal . helmut kohl and marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive center , crossed swords again on wednesday in berlin ’ s higher administrative court .
this time birthler won . for years now , the former german chancellor and the head of the authority that administers secret police files from the former east germany have locked horns over whether journalists and researchers should be given access to material compiled by stasi agents who spied on kohl during his 16 administration .
in 2001 , a german federal administrative court in karlsruhe ruled that kohl ’ s file must remain under seal because its release would violate his privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl however , the berlin court ruled on wednesday that kohl ’ s 7,000 page file should be made public based on an amendment to the federal law governing access to the stasi archive passed last year .
the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .
in other words , we won ’ t obtain full clarity on the issue any time soon , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the authority that administers the stasi files indeed , kohl 's lawyers said the former chancellor would appeal the ruling .
kohl has made it clear he is prepared to pursue the issue at the highest judicial level , the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
kohl and his lawyers contend the ban on releasing personal data should be upheld and that the recent legal changes are unconstitutional .
" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .
a smoking gun ?
kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the court 's ruling against kohl is upheld , the decision would have sweeping implications .
until now , investigations into the stasi archives have largely been restricted to uncovering informants from the former east .
the focus has recently shifted to unmasking west german spies who worked for the east german secret police - a development that some fear could uncover explosive revelations about prominent germans if they are unable to block access to their files .
but another ruling in favor of kohl would also face criticism , since it could exacerbate rifts between east and west in a country still trying to come to terms with its recent history .
many eastern germans argue that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans who were spied on by the stasi and who , after reunification , were embarrassed by stasi file revelations long hidden in the archives .
a speedy conclusion to the case is unlikely , especially since the two sides are willing to take it to the constitutional court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de famed journalist accused of stasi ties files from the former east german secret police released by the cia two months ago suggest that one of west germany 's best-known investigative journalists may have been an informant for the stasi .

it could contain revelations about his role in a slush fund scandal . helmut kohl and marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive center , crossed swords again on wednesday in berlin ’ s higher administrative court .
this time birthler won . for years now , the former german chancellor and the head of the authority that administers secret police files from the former east germany have locked horns over whether journalists and researchers should be given access to material compiled by stasi agents who spied on kohl during his 16 administration .
in 2001 , a german federal administrative court in karlsruhe ruled that kohl ’ s file must remain under seal because its release would violate his privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl however , the berlin court ruled on wednesday that kohl ’ s 7,000 page file should be made public based on an amendment to the federal law governing access to the stasi archive passed last year .
the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .
in other words , we won ’ t obtain full clarity on the issue any time soon , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the authority that administers the stasi files indeed , kohl 's lawyers said the former chancellor would appeal the ruling .
kohl has made it clear he is prepared to pursue the issue at the highest judicial level , the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
kohl and his lawyers contend the ban on releasing personal data should be upheld and that the recent legal changes are unconstitutional .
" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .
a smoking gun ?
kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the court 's ruling against kohl is upheld , the decision would have sweeping implications .
until now , investigations into the stasi archives have largely been restricted to uncovering informants from the former east .
the focus has recently shifted to unmasking west german spies who worked for the east german secret police - a development that some fear could uncover explosive revelations about prominent germans if they are unable to block access to their files .
but another ruling in favor of kohl would also face criticism , since it could exacerbate rifts between east and west in a country still trying to come to terms with its recent history .
many eastern germans argue that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans who were spied on by the stasi and who , after reunification , were embarrassed by stasi file revelations long hidden in the archives .
a speedy conclusion to the case is unlikely , especially since the two sides are willing to take it to the constitutional court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de famed journalist accused of stasi ties files from the former east german secret police released by the cia two months ago suggest that one of west germany 's best-known investigative journalists may have been an informant for the stasi .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

it could contain revelations about his role in a slush fund scandal . helmut kohl and marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive center , crossed swords again on wednesday in berlin ’ s higher administrative court .
this time birthler won . for years now , the former german chancellor and the head of the authority that administers secret police files from the former east germany have locked horns over whether journalists and researchers should be given access to material compiled by stasi agents who spied on kohl during his 16 administration .
in 2001 , a german federal administrative court in karlsruhe ruled that kohl ’ s file must remain under seal because its release would violate his privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl however , the berlin court ruled on wednesday that kohl ’ s 7,000 page file should be made public based on an amendment to the federal law governing access to the stasi archive passed last year .
the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .
in other words , we won ’ t obtain full clarity on the issue any time soon , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the authority that administers the stasi files indeed , kohl 's lawyers said the former chancellor would appeal the ruling .
kohl has made it clear he is prepared to pursue the issue at the highest judicial level , the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
kohl and his lawyers contend the ban on releasing personal data should be upheld and that the recent legal changes are unconstitutional .
" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .
a smoking gun ?
kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the court 's ruling against kohl is upheld , the decision would have sweeping implications .
until now , investigations into the stasi archives have largely been restricted to uncovering informants from the former east .
the focus has recently shifted to unmasking west german spies who worked for the east german secret police - a development that some fear could uncover explosive revelations about prominent germans if they are unable to block access to their files .
but another ruling in favor of kohl would also face criticism , since it could exacerbate rifts between east and west in a country still trying to come to terms with its recent history .
many eastern germans argue that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans who were spied on by the stasi and who , after reunification , were embarrassed by stasi file revelations long hidden in the archives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2003 germany celebrates 30 years at the u.n. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has played a high-profile role at the u.n. security council since the war in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder will fly next week to new york for a meeting of the united nations general assembly .
while there he will also attend festivities celebrating 30 years of german membership at the u.n. schröder will use his trip to reaffirm germany ’ s commitment to strengthening the united nations ’ role in resolving international conflicts .
but he will also take time to meet u.s. president george bush in an attempt to patch up german-american ties so badly damaged by disagreement over the war in iraq . though thursday will officially mark the 30th anniversary of german membership at the united nations , the party sponsored by the german u.n. mission won ’ t take place at new york ’ s swanky grand hyatt hotel until after schröder arrives on september 23 .
considering how dramatically germany ’ s role at the world forum has changed over the past three decades , most observers would agree there ’ s something to celebrate . membership delayed currently a high-profile rotating member of the u.n. security council , war-torn germany was not even considered for membership when the united nations was founded in 1945 .
the ensuing division of the country then delayed the process by some 20 years as west and east germany fought over international recognition .
only after west germany gave up its demand to be the only legitimate representative of the german people , did both nations become full members of the u.n. general assembly on september 18 , 1973 . only a few days later german foreign minster walter scheel addressed the issue that had keep west germany as nation with only “ active non-member ” status for so many years in his first speech at the united nations . “ do you understand why we hesitated to join the united nations ?
it is painful to look the political division of your own land in the eye , ” scheel said .
“ we feared that such a step would create the impression that we were resigned .
as if we had given up hope for unification . ” after unification in 1990 , the two german seats became one and modern germany began to orient its u.n. polices less on cold war realities and more on human rights , development and the peaceful resolution of conflicts .
the third largest u.n. donor following the united states and japan , germany now accounts for roughly ten percent of the u.n. budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in kabul , afghanistan .

career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term although the netherlands has n't even formally proposed jaap de hoop scheffer for nato secretary-general , the cards seem to be falling the foreign minister 's way .
nato insiders in brussels on wednesday confirmed a german newspaper report that alleged the dutch diplomat was the top candidate to lead the north atlantic alliance after the current head , the scot george robertson , completes his term in mid-december . the united states in particular is expected to support de hoop scheffer 's nomination .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

it could contain revelations about his role in a slush fund scandal . helmut kohl and marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive center , crossed swords again on wednesday in berlin ’ s higher administrative court .
this time birthler won . for years now , the former german chancellor and the head of the authority that administers secret police files from the former east germany have locked horns over whether journalists and researchers should be given access to material compiled by stasi agents who spied on kohl during his 16 administration .
in 2001 , a german federal administrative court in karlsruhe ruled that kohl ’ s file must remain under seal because its release would violate his privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl however , the berlin court ruled on wednesday that kohl ’ s 7,000 page file should be made public based on an amendment to the federal law governing access to the stasi archive passed last year .
the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .
in other words , we won ’ t obtain full clarity on the issue any time soon , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the authority that administers the stasi files indeed , kohl 's lawyers said the former chancellor would appeal the ruling .
kohl has made it clear he is prepared to pursue the issue at the highest judicial level , the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
kohl and his lawyers contend the ban on releasing personal data should be upheld and that the recent legal changes are unconstitutional .
" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .
a smoking gun ?
kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the court 's ruling against kohl is upheld , the decision would have sweeping implications .
until now , investigations into the stasi archives have largely been restricted to uncovering informants from the former east .
the focus has recently shifted to unmasking west german spies who worked for the east german secret police - a development that some fear could uncover explosive revelations about prominent germans if they are unable to block access to their files .
but another ruling in favor of kohl would also face criticism , since it could exacerbate rifts between east and west in a country still trying to come to terms with its recent history .
many eastern germans argue that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans who were spied on by the stasi and who , after reunification , were embarrassed by stasi file revelations long hidden in the archives .
a speedy conclusion to the case is unlikely , especially since the two sides are willing to take it to the constitutional court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de famed journalist accused of stasi ties files from the former east german secret police released by the cia two months ago suggest that one of west germany 's best-known investigative journalists may have been an informant for the stasi .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .

baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will fly next week to new york for a meeting of the united nations general assembly .
while there he will also attend festivities celebrating 30 years of german membership at the u.n. schröder will use his trip to reaffirm germany ’ s commitment to strengthening the united nations ’ role in resolving international conflicts .
but he will also take time to meet u.s. president george bush in an attempt to patch up german-american ties so badly damaged by disagreement over the war in iraq . though thursday will officially mark the 30th anniversary of german membership at the united nations , the party sponsored by the german u.n. mission won ’ t take place at new york ’ s swanky grand hyatt hotel until after schröder arrives on september 23 .
considering how dramatically germany ’ s role at the world forum has changed over the past three decades , most observers would agree there ’ s something to celebrate . membership delayed currently a high-profile rotating member of the u.n. security council , war-torn germany was not even considered for membership when the united nations was founded in 1945 .
the ensuing division of the country then delayed the process by some 20 years as west and east germany fought over international recognition .
only after west germany gave up its demand to be the only legitimate representative of the german people , did both nations become full members of the u.n. general assembly on september 18 , 1973 . only a few days later german foreign minster walter scheel addressed the issue that had keep west germany as nation with only “ active non-member ” status for so many years in his first speech at the united nations . “ do you understand why we hesitated to join the united nations ?
it is painful to look the political division of your own land in the eye , ” scheel said .
“ we feared that such a step would create the impression that we were resigned .
as if we had given up hope for unification . ” after unification in 1990 , the two german seats became one and modern germany began to orient its u.n. polices less on cold war realities and more on human rights , development and the peaceful resolution of conflicts .
the third largest u.n. donor following the united states and japan , germany now accounts for roughly ten percent of the u.n. budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in kabul , afghanistan .
as germany began to redefine its postwar role anew , it eventually came the watershed decision that german soldiers could once again be deployed abroad for peacekeeping missions that had u.n. backing .
in little over ten years , germany has taken part in operations in somalia , the balkans and afghanistan . although all but the most extreme pacifistic german parliamentarians now appear comfortable sending german troops overseas under a u.n. mandate , germany ’ s steadfast belief in using the world body to resolve international conflicts has created problems for the country ’ s once strong relations with the united states . angry america last year , chancellor schröder angered u.n. skeptic bush by saying germany would not support a u.n. resolution backing military action to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein no matter what .
as a rotating member of the security council , germany may not have a veto like permanent seat-holders such as france or russia , but schröder ’ s unyielding opposition left little room for diplomatic maneuver , likely emboldening other war opponents . “ germany without a doubt gained stature through its behavior during the iraq conflict , ” one high-ranking western diplomat told the german news agency dpa .
but at the same time , berlin ’ s newfound independence has also likely encouraged washington to put the kibosh on germany getting its own permanent seat on the security council for the foreseeable future . but such long-term german goals are likely not even on the agenda during schröder ’ s trip .
instead , he will be more concerned with showing bush that germany can still be america ’ s friend even if the two countries don ’ t always agree on every issue .
for his part , bush will hope he can get schröder to support a new u.n. resolution that would pave the way for more international participation in stabilizing iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign minsters fail to reach agreement on iraq 's future divided foreign ministers of the five permanent u.n. security council member countries ended a crucial meeting in geneva saturday with no major breakthrough on talks for international support for the u.s. in iraq .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will fly next week to new york for a meeting of the united nations general assembly .
while there he will also attend festivities celebrating 30 years of german membership at the u.n. schröder will use his trip to reaffirm germany ’ s commitment to strengthening the united nations ’ role in resolving international conflicts .
but he will also take time to meet u.s. president george bush in an attempt to patch up german-american ties so badly damaged by disagreement over the war in iraq . though thursday will officially mark the 30th anniversary of german membership at the united nations , the party sponsored by the german u.n. mission won ’ t take place at new york ’ s swanky grand hyatt hotel until after schröder arrives on september 23 .
considering how dramatically germany ’ s role at the world forum has changed over the past three decades , most observers would agree there ’ s something to celebrate . membership delayed currently a high-profile rotating member of the u.n. security council , war-torn germany was not even considered for membership when the united nations was founded in 1945 .
the ensuing division of the country then delayed the process by some 20 years as west and east germany fought over international recognition .
only after west germany gave up its demand to be the only legitimate representative of the german people , did both nations become full members of the u.n. general assembly on september 18 , 1973 . only a few days later german foreign minster walter scheel addressed the issue that had keep west germany as nation with only “ active non-member ” status for so many years in his first speech at the united nations . “ do you understand why we hesitated to join the united nations ?
it is painful to look the political division of your own land in the eye , ” scheel said .
“ we feared that such a step would create the impression that we were resigned .
as if we had given up hope for unification . ” after unification in 1990 , the two german seats became one and modern germany began to orient its u.n. polices less on cold war realities and more on human rights , development and the peaceful resolution of conflicts .
the third largest u.n. donor following the united states and japan , germany now accounts for roughly ten percent of the u.n. budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in kabul , afghanistan .
as germany began to redefine its postwar role anew , it eventually came the watershed decision that german soldiers could once again be deployed abroad for peacekeeping missions that had u.n. backing .
in little over ten years , germany has taken part in operations in somalia , the balkans and afghanistan . although all but the most extreme pacifistic german parliamentarians now appear comfortable sending german troops overseas under a u.n. mandate , germany ’ s steadfast belief in using the world body to resolve international conflicts has created problems for the country ’ s once strong relations with the united states . angry america last year , chancellor schröder angered u.n. skeptic bush by saying germany would not support a u.n. resolution backing military action to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein no matter what .
as a rotating member of the security council , germany may not have a veto like permanent seat-holders such as france or russia , but schröder ’ s unyielding opposition left little room for diplomatic maneuver , likely emboldening other war opponents . “ germany without a doubt gained stature through its behavior during the iraq conflict , ” one high-ranking western diplomat told the german news agency dpa .
but at the same time , berlin ’ s newfound independence has also likely encouraged washington to put the kibosh on germany getting its own permanent seat on the security council for the foreseeable future . but such long-term german goals are likely not even on the agenda during schröder ’ s trip .
instead , he will be more concerned with showing bush that germany can still be america ’ s friend even if the two countries don ’ t always agree on every issue .
for his part , bush will hope he can get schröder to support a new u.n. resolution that would pave the way for more international participation in stabilizing iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign minsters fail to reach agreement on iraq 's future divided foreign ministers of the five permanent u.n. security council member countries ended a crucial meeting in geneva saturday with no major breakthrough on talks for international support for the u.s. in iraq .

it could contain revelations about his role in a slush fund scandal . helmut kohl and marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive center , crossed swords again on wednesday in berlin ’ s higher administrative court .
this time birthler won . for years now , the former german chancellor and the head of the authority that administers secret police files from the former east germany have locked horns over whether journalists and researchers should be given access to material compiled by stasi agents who spied on kohl during his 16 administration .
in 2001 , a german federal administrative court in karlsruhe ruled that kohl ’ s file must remain under seal because its release would violate his privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl however , the berlin court ruled on wednesday that kohl ’ s 7,000 page file should be made public based on an amendment to the federal law governing access to the stasi archive passed last year .
the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .
in other words , we won ’ t obtain full clarity on the issue any time soon , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the authority that administers the stasi files indeed , kohl 's lawyers said the former chancellor would appeal the ruling .
kohl has made it clear he is prepared to pursue the issue at the highest judicial level , the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
kohl and his lawyers contend the ban on releasing personal data should be upheld and that the recent legal changes are unconstitutional .
" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .
a smoking gun ?
kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the court 's ruling against kohl is upheld , the decision would have sweeping implications .
until now , investigations into the stasi archives have largely been restricted to uncovering informants from the former east .
the focus has recently shifted to unmasking west german spies who worked for the east german secret police - a development that some fear could uncover explosive revelations about prominent germans if they are unable to block access to their files .
but another ruling in favor of kohl would also face criticism , since it could exacerbate rifts between east and west in a country still trying to come to terms with its recent history .
many eastern germans argue that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans who were spied on by the stasi and who , after reunification , were embarrassed by stasi file revelations long hidden in the archives .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

it could contain revelations about his role in a slush fund scandal . helmut kohl and marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive center , crossed swords again on wednesday in berlin ’ s higher administrative court .
this time birthler won . for years now , the former german chancellor and the head of the authority that administers secret police files from the former east germany have locked horns over whether journalists and researchers should be given access to material compiled by stasi agents who spied on kohl during his 16 administration .
in 2001 , a german federal administrative court in karlsruhe ruled that kohl ’ s file must remain under seal because its release would violate his privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl however , the berlin court ruled on wednesday that kohl ’ s 7,000 page file should be made public based on an amendment to the federal law governing access to the stasi archive passed last year .
the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .
in other words , we won ’ t obtain full clarity on the issue any time soon , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the authority that administers the stasi files indeed , kohl 's lawyers said the former chancellor would appeal the ruling .
kohl has made it clear he is prepared to pursue the issue at the highest judicial level , the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
kohl and his lawyers contend the ban on releasing personal data should be upheld and that the recent legal changes are unconstitutional .
" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .
a smoking gun ?
kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the court 's ruling against kohl is upheld , the decision would have sweeping implications .
until now , investigations into the stasi archives have largely been restricted to uncovering informants from the former east .
the focus has recently shifted to unmasking west german spies who worked for the east german secret police - a development that some fear could uncover explosive revelations about prominent germans if they are unable to block access to their files .
but another ruling in favor of kohl would also face criticism , since it could exacerbate rifts between east and west in a country still trying to come to terms with its recent history .
many eastern germans argue that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans who were spied on by the stasi and who , after reunification , were embarrassed by stasi file revelations long hidden in the archives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.09.2003 dutch foreign minister slated to head nato großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de hoop scheffer : the man of the moment , now the netherlands just has to propose him .
career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term although the netherlands has n't even formally proposed jaap de hoop scheffer for nato secretary-general , the cards seem to be falling the foreign minister 's way .
nato insiders in brussels on wednesday confirmed a german newspaper report that alleged the dutch diplomat was the top candidate to lead the north atlantic alliance after the current head , the scot george robertson , completes his term in mid-december . the united states in particular is expected to support de hoop scheffer 's nomination .
the netherlands shored up washington in the iraq war .
" if it had been up to him the dutch would not only have bolstered -lsb- the americans -rsb- politically but also militarily , " the dutch de volkskrant newspaper recently wrote . canada and france , however , are still thought to have reservations about de hoop scheffer .
canada has put in its own bid , finance minister john manley , a former foreign minister , who is regarded as the only real competition since norwegian defense minister kristin krohn devold announced she would not pursue the top nato position last week . a european edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels but jaap de hoop scheffer has a strong edge over manley : he 's european .
europe has always provided the alliance with secretary generals , while the nato supreme commander in europe has traditionally been an american . france has denied its reservations stem from the desire to avoid putting a man in office who supported the war in iraq and the united states .
it has signaled its willingness to drop its reservations in a gesture of european solidarity , the dpa news agency reported . germany is also thought to favor the dutchman at nato 's helm .
and both the belgian government and norwegian defense minister devold have given their endorsement . a career in diplomacy de hoop scheffer has been his country 's foreign minister since july 2002 .
although his military experience is limited to two years mandatory military service in the dutch air force in the 1970s , which he completed as a reserve officer , it is his diplomatic career that makes him qualified for the top civilian position . the native amsterdamer studied law at the university of leiden , and joined the diplomatic service after finishing his military service .
from 1978 to 1980 he became acquainted with nato structures while working for the dutch delegation in brussels . de hoop scheffer had been tipped as a possible candidate for the next prime minister of the netherlands , where he 's a member of the christian democratic alliance .
if elected to head up nato , the 55-year-old would be the third dutch secretary general out of a total of ten in the alliance 's fifty-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing nato secretary general george robertson but the name of the next secretary general will not actually be made official until the alliance 's 19 member states have submitted their nomination and the nato council , the alliance 's top decision making body , has approved it - a process washinton 's envoy in brussels has said is as arcane as electing the pope . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

it could contain revelations about his role in a slush fund scandal . helmut kohl and marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive center , crossed swords again on wednesday in berlin ’ s higher administrative court .
this time birthler won . for years now , the former german chancellor and the head of the authority that administers secret police files from the former east germany have locked horns over whether journalists and researchers should be given access to material compiled by stasi agents who spied on kohl during his 16 administration .
in 2001 , a german federal administrative court in karlsruhe ruled that kohl ’ s file must remain under seal because its release would violate his privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl however , the berlin court ruled on wednesday that kohl ’ s 7,000 page file should be made public based on an amendment to the federal law governing access to the stasi archive passed last year .
the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .
in other words , we won ’ t obtain full clarity on the issue any time soon , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the authority that administers the stasi files indeed , kohl 's lawyers said the former chancellor would appeal the ruling .
kohl has made it clear he is prepared to pursue the issue at the highest judicial level , the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
kohl and his lawyers contend the ban on releasing personal data should be upheld and that the recent legal changes are unconstitutional .
" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .
a smoking gun ?
kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the court 's ruling against kohl is upheld , the decision would have sweeping implications .
until now , investigations into the stasi archives have largely been restricted to uncovering informants from the former east .
the focus has recently shifted to unmasking west german spies who worked for the east german secret police - a development that some fear could uncover explosive revelations about prominent germans if they are unable to block access to their files .
but another ruling in favor of kohl would also face criticism , since it could exacerbate rifts between east and west in a country still trying to come to terms with its recent history .
many eastern germans argue that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans who were spied on by the stasi and who , after reunification , were embarrassed by stasi file revelations long hidden in the archives .
a speedy conclusion to the case is unlikely , especially since the two sides are willing to take it to the constitutional court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de famed journalist accused of stasi ties files from the former east german secret police released by the cia two months ago suggest that one of west germany 's best-known investigative journalists may have been an informant for the stasi .

the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .
in other words , we won ’ t obtain full clarity on the issue any time soon , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the authority that administers the stasi files indeed , kohl 's lawyers said the former chancellor would appeal the ruling .
kohl has made it clear he is prepared to pursue the issue at the highest judicial level , the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
kohl and his lawyers contend the ban on releasing personal data should be upheld and that the recent legal changes are unconstitutional .
" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .
a smoking gun ?
kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the court 's ruling against kohl is upheld , the decision would have sweeping implications .
until now , investigations into the stasi archives have largely been restricted to uncovering informants from the former east .
the focus has recently shifted to unmasking west german spies who worked for the east german secret police - a development that some fear could uncover explosive revelations about prominent germans if they are unable to block access to their files .
but another ruling in favor of kohl would also face criticism , since it could exacerbate rifts between east and west in a country still trying to come to terms with its recent history .
many eastern germans argue that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans who were spied on by the stasi and who , after reunification , were embarrassed by stasi file revelations long hidden in the archives .

but at the same time , berlin ’ s newfound independence has also likely encouraged washington to put the kibosh on germany getting its own permanent seat on the security council for the foreseeable future . but such long-term german goals are likely not even on the agenda during schröder ’ s trip .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term although the netherlands has n't even formally proposed jaap de hoop scheffer for nato secretary-general , the cards seem to be falling the foreign minister 's way .
nato insiders in brussels on wednesday confirmed a german newspaper report that alleged the dutch diplomat was the top candidate to lead the north atlantic alliance after the current head , the scot george robertson , completes his term in mid-december . the united states in particular is expected to support de hoop scheffer 's nomination .
the netherlands shored up washington in the iraq war .
" if it had been up to him the dutch would not only have bolstered -lsb- the americans -rsb- politically but also militarily , " the dutch de volkskrant newspaper recently wrote . canada and france , however , are still thought to have reservations about de hoop scheffer .
canada has put in its own bid , finance minister john manley , a former foreign minister , who is regarded as the only real competition since norwegian defense minister kristin krohn devold announced she would not pursue the top nato position last week . a european edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels but jaap de hoop scheffer has a strong edge over manley : he 's european .
europe has always provided the alliance with secretary generals , while the nato supreme commander in europe has traditionally been an american . france has denied its reservations stem from the desire to avoid putting a man in office who supported the war in iraq and the united states .
it has signaled its willingness to drop its reservations in a gesture of european solidarity , the dpa news agency reported . germany is also thought to favor the dutchman at nato 's helm .
and both the belgian government and norwegian defense minister devold have given their endorsement . a career in diplomacy de hoop scheffer has been his country 's foreign minister since july 2002 .
although his military experience is limited to two years mandatory military service in the dutch air force in the 1970s , which he completed as a reserve officer , it is his diplomatic career that makes him qualified for the top civilian position . the native amsterdamer studied law at the university of leiden , and joined the diplomatic service after finishing his military service .
from 1978 to 1980 he became acquainted with nato structures while working for the dutch delegation in brussels . de hoop scheffer had been tipped as a possible candidate for the next prime minister of the netherlands , where he 's a member of the christian democratic alliance .
if elected to head up nato , the 55-year-old would be the third dutch secretary general out of a total of ten in the alliance 's fifty-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing nato secretary general george robertson but the name of the next secretary general will not actually be made official until the alliance 's 19 member states have submitted their nomination and the nato council , the alliance 's top decision making body , has approved it - a process washinton 's envoy in brussels has said is as arcane as electing the pope . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will fly next week to new york for a meeting of the united nations general assembly .
while there he will also attend festivities celebrating 30 years of german membership at the u.n. schröder will use his trip to reaffirm germany ’ s commitment to strengthening the united nations ’ role in resolving international conflicts .
but he will also take time to meet u.s. president george bush in an attempt to patch up german-american ties so badly damaged by disagreement over the war in iraq . though thursday will officially mark the 30th anniversary of german membership at the united nations , the party sponsored by the german u.n. mission won ’ t take place at new york ’ s swanky grand hyatt hotel until after schröder arrives on september 23 .
considering how dramatically germany ’ s role at the world forum has changed over the past three decades , most observers would agree there ’ s something to celebrate . membership delayed currently a high-profile rotating member of the u.n. security council , war-torn germany was not even considered for membership when the united nations was founded in 1945 .
the ensuing division of the country then delayed the process by some 20 years as west and east germany fought over international recognition .
only after west germany gave up its demand to be the only legitimate representative of the german people , did both nations become full members of the u.n. general assembly on september 18 , 1973 . only a few days later german foreign minster walter scheel addressed the issue that had keep west germany as nation with only “ active non-member ” status for so many years in his first speech at the united nations . “ do you understand why we hesitated to join the united nations ?
it is painful to look the political division of your own land in the eye , ” scheel said .
“ we feared that such a step would create the impression that we were resigned .
as if we had given up hope for unification . ” after unification in 1990 , the two german seats became one and modern germany began to orient its u.n. polices less on cold war realities and more on human rights , development and the peaceful resolution of conflicts .
the third largest u.n. donor following the united states and japan , germany now accounts for roughly ten percent of the u.n. budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in kabul , afghanistan .
as germany began to redefine its postwar role anew , it eventually came the watershed decision that german soldiers could once again be deployed abroad for peacekeeping missions that had u.n. backing .
in little over ten years , germany has taken part in operations in somalia , the balkans and afghanistan . although all but the most extreme pacifistic german parliamentarians now appear comfortable sending german troops overseas under a u.n. mandate , germany ’ s steadfast belief in using the world body to resolve international conflicts has created problems for the country ’ s once strong relations with the united states . angry america last year , chancellor schröder angered u.n. skeptic bush by saying germany would not support a u.n. resolution backing military action to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein no matter what .
as a rotating member of the security council , germany may not have a veto like permanent seat-holders such as france or russia , but schröder ’ s unyielding opposition left little room for diplomatic maneuver , likely emboldening other war opponents . “ germany without a doubt gained stature through its behavior during the iraq conflict , ” one high-ranking western diplomat told the german news agency dpa .
but at the same time , berlin ’ s newfound independence has also likely encouraged washington to put the kibosh on germany getting its own permanent seat on the security council for the foreseeable future . but such long-term german goals are likely not even on the agenda during schröder ’ s trip .
instead , he will be more concerned with showing bush that germany can still be america ’ s friend even if the two countries don ’ t always agree on every issue .
for his part , bush will hope he can get schröder to support a new u.n. resolution that would pave the way for more international participation in stabilizing iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign minsters fail to reach agreement on iraq 's future divided foreign ministers of the five permanent u.n. security council member countries ended a crucial meeting in geneva saturday with no major breakthrough on talks for international support for the u.s. in iraq .

it could contain revelations about his role in a slush fund scandal . helmut kohl and marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive center , crossed swords again on wednesday in berlin ’ s higher administrative court .
this time birthler won . for years now , the former german chancellor and the head of the authority that administers secret police files from the former east germany have locked horns over whether journalists and researchers should be given access to material compiled by stasi agents who spied on kohl during his 16 administration .
in 2001 , a german federal administrative court in karlsruhe ruled that kohl ’ s file must remain under seal because its release would violate his privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl however , the berlin court ruled on wednesday that kohl ’ s 7,000 page file should be made public based on an amendment to the federal law governing access to the stasi archive passed last year .
the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .
in other words , we won ’ t obtain full clarity on the issue any time soon , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the authority that administers the stasi files indeed , kohl 's lawyers said the former chancellor would appeal the ruling .
kohl has made it clear he is prepared to pursue the issue at the highest judicial level , the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
kohl and his lawyers contend the ban on releasing personal data should be upheld and that the recent legal changes are unconstitutional .
" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .
a smoking gun ?
kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the court 's ruling against kohl is upheld , the decision would have sweeping implications .
until now , investigations into the stasi archives have largely been restricted to uncovering informants from the former east .
the focus has recently shifted to unmasking west german spies who worked for the east german secret police - a development that some fear could uncover explosive revelations about prominent germans if they are unable to block access to their files .
but another ruling in favor of kohl would also face criticism , since it could exacerbate rifts between east and west in a country still trying to come to terms with its recent history .
many eastern germans argue that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans who were spied on by the stasi and who , after reunification , were embarrassed by stasi file revelations long hidden in the archives .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will fly next week to new york for a meeting of the united nations general assembly .
while there he will also attend festivities celebrating 30 years of german membership at the u.n. schröder will use his trip to reaffirm germany ’ s commitment to strengthening the united nations ’ role in resolving international conflicts .
but he will also take time to meet u.s. president george bush in an attempt to patch up german-american ties so badly damaged by disagreement over the war in iraq . though thursday will officially mark the 30th anniversary of german membership at the united nations , the party sponsored by the german u.n. mission won ’ t take place at new york ’ s swanky grand hyatt hotel until after schröder arrives on september 23 .
considering how dramatically germany ’ s role at the world forum has changed over the past three decades , most observers would agree there ’ s something to celebrate . membership delayed currently a high-profile rotating member of the u.n. security council , war-torn germany was not even considered for membership when the united nations was founded in 1945 .
the ensuing division of the country then delayed the process by some 20 years as west and east germany fought over international recognition .
only after west germany gave up its demand to be the only legitimate representative of the german people , did both nations become full members of the u.n. general assembly on september 18 , 1973 . only a few days later german foreign minster walter scheel addressed the issue that had keep west germany as nation with only “ active non-member ” status for so many years in his first speech at the united nations . “ do you understand why we hesitated to join the united nations ?
it is painful to look the political division of your own land in the eye , ” scheel said .
“ we feared that such a step would create the impression that we were resigned .
as if we had given up hope for unification . ” after unification in 1990 , the two german seats became one and modern germany began to orient its u.n. polices less on cold war realities and more on human rights , development and the peaceful resolution of conflicts .
the third largest u.n. donor following the united states and japan , germany now accounts for roughly ten percent of the u.n. budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in kabul , afghanistan .
as germany began to redefine its postwar role anew , it eventually came the watershed decision that german soldiers could once again be deployed abroad for peacekeeping missions that had u.n. backing .
in little over ten years , germany has taken part in operations in somalia , the balkans and afghanistan . although all but the most extreme pacifistic german parliamentarians now appear comfortable sending german troops overseas under a u.n. mandate , germany ’ s steadfast belief in using the world body to resolve international conflicts has created problems for the country ’ s once strong relations with the united states . angry america last year , chancellor schröder angered u.n. skeptic bush by saying germany would not support a u.n. resolution backing military action to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein no matter what .
as a rotating member of the security council , germany may not have a veto like permanent seat-holders such as france or russia , but schröder ’ s unyielding opposition left little room for diplomatic maneuver , likely emboldening other war opponents . “ germany without a doubt gained stature through its behavior during the iraq conflict , ” one high-ranking western diplomat told the german news agency dpa .
but at the same time , berlin ’ s newfound independence has also likely encouraged washington to put the kibosh on germany getting its own permanent seat on the security council for the foreseeable future . but such long-term german goals are likely not even on the agenda during schröder ’ s trip .
instead , he will be more concerned with showing bush that germany can still be america ’ s friend even if the two countries don ’ t always agree on every issue .
for his part , bush will hope he can get schröder to support a new u.n. resolution that would pave the way for more international participation in stabilizing iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign minsters fail to reach agreement on iraq 's future divided foreign ministers of the five permanent u.n. security council member countries ended a crucial meeting in geneva saturday with no major breakthrough on talks for international support for the u.s. in iraq .

it could contain revelations about his role in a slush fund scandal . helmut kohl and marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive center , crossed swords again on wednesday in berlin ’ s higher administrative court .
this time birthler won . for years now , the former german chancellor and the head of the authority that administers secret police files from the former east germany have locked horns over whether journalists and researchers should be given access to material compiled by stasi agents who spied on kohl during his 16 administration .
in 2001 , a german federal administrative court in karlsruhe ruled that kohl ’ s file must remain under seal because its release would violate his privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl however , the berlin court ruled on wednesday that kohl ’ s 7,000 page file should be made public based on an amendment to the federal law governing access to the stasi archive passed last year .
the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .

" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .

kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .

it could contain revelations about his role in a slush fund scandal . helmut kohl and marianne birthler , the head of the stasi archive center , crossed swords again on wednesday in berlin ’ s higher administrative court .
this time birthler won . for years now , the former german chancellor and the head of the authority that administers secret police files from the former east germany have locked horns over whether journalists and researchers should be given access to material compiled by stasi agents who spied on kohl during his 16 administration .
in 2001 , a german federal administrative court in karlsruhe ruled that kohl ’ s file must remain under seal because its release would violate his privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl however , the berlin court ruled on wednesday that kohl ’ s 7,000 page file should be made public based on an amendment to the federal law governing access to the stasi archive passed last year .
the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .
in other words , we won ’ t obtain full clarity on the issue any time soon , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the authority that administers the stasi files indeed , kohl 's lawyers said the former chancellor would appeal the ruling .
kohl has made it clear he is prepared to pursue the issue at the highest judicial level , the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
kohl and his lawyers contend the ban on releasing personal data should be upheld and that the recent legal changes are unconstitutional .
" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .
a smoking gun ?
kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the court 's ruling against kohl is upheld , the decision would have sweeping implications .
until now , investigations into the stasi archives have largely been restricted to uncovering informants from the former east .
the focus has recently shifted to unmasking west german spies who worked for the east german secret police - a development that some fear could uncover explosive revelations about prominent germans if they are unable to block access to their files .
but another ruling in favor of kohl would also face criticism , since it could exacerbate rifts between east and west in a country still trying to come to terms with its recent history .
many eastern germans argue that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans who were spied on by the stasi and who , after reunification , were embarrassed by stasi file revelations long hidden in the archives .

career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term although the netherlands has n't even formally proposed jaap de hoop scheffer for nato secretary-general , the cards seem to be falling the foreign minister 's way .
nato insiders in brussels on wednesday confirmed a german newspaper report that alleged the dutch diplomat was the top candidate to lead the north atlantic alliance after the current head , the scot george robertson , completes his term in mid-december . the united states in particular is expected to support de hoop scheffer 's nomination .
the netherlands shored up washington in the iraq war .
" if it had been up to him the dutch would not only have bolstered -lsb- the americans -rsb- politically but also militarily , " the dutch de volkskrant newspaper recently wrote . canada and france , however , are still thought to have reservations about de hoop scheffer .
canada has put in its own bid , finance minister john manley , a former foreign minister , who is regarded as the only real competition since norwegian defense minister kristin krohn devold announced she would not pursue the top nato position last week . a european edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels but jaap de hoop scheffer has a strong edge over manley : he 's european .
europe has always provided the alliance with secretary generals , while the nato supreme commander in europe has traditionally been an american . france has denied its reservations stem from the desire to avoid putting a man in office who supported the war in iraq and the united states .
it has signaled its willingness to drop its reservations in a gesture of european solidarity , the dpa news agency reported . germany is also thought to favor the dutchman at nato 's helm .
and both the belgian government and norwegian defense minister devold have given their endorsement . a career in diplomacy de hoop scheffer has been his country 's foreign minister since july 2002 .
although his military experience is limited to two years mandatory military service in the dutch air force in the 1970s , which he completed as a reserve officer , it is his diplomatic career that makes him qualified for the top civilian position . the native amsterdamer studied law at the university of leiden , and joined the diplomatic service after finishing his military service .
from 1978 to 1980 he became acquainted with nato structures while working for the dutch delegation in brussels . de hoop scheffer had been tipped as a possible candidate for the next prime minister of the netherlands , where he 's a member of the christian democratic alliance .
if elected to head up nato , the 55-year-old would be the third dutch secretary general out of a total of ten in the alliance 's fifty-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing nato secretary general george robertson but the name of the next secretary general will not actually be made official until the alliance 's 19 member states have submitted their nomination and the nato council , the alliance 's top decision making body , has approved it - a process washinton 's envoy in brussels has said is as arcane as electing the pope . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .
so why was indian director shyam benegal shooting a film on bose ’ s life in germany ?

it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .

you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will fly next week to new york for a meeting of the united nations general assembly .
while there he will also attend festivities celebrating 30 years of german membership at the u.n. schröder will use his trip to reaffirm germany ’ s commitment to strengthening the united nations ’ role in resolving international conflicts .
but he will also take time to meet u.s. president george bush in an attempt to patch up german-american ties so badly damaged by disagreement over the war in iraq . though thursday will officially mark the 30th anniversary of german membership at the united nations , the party sponsored by the german u.n. mission won ’ t take place at new york ’ s swanky grand hyatt hotel until after schröder arrives on september 23 .
considering how dramatically germany ’ s role at the world forum has changed over the past three decades , most observers would agree there ’ s something to celebrate . membership delayed currently a high-profile rotating member of the u.n. security council , war-torn germany was not even considered for membership when the united nations was founded in 1945 .
the ensuing division of the country then delayed the process by some 20 years as west and east germany fought over international recognition .
only after west germany gave up its demand to be the only legitimate representative of the german people , did both nations become full members of the u.n. general assembly on september 18 , 1973 . only a few days later german foreign minster walter scheel addressed the issue that had keep west germany as nation with only “ active non-member ” status for so many years in his first speech at the united nations . “ do you understand why we hesitated to join the united nations ?
it is painful to look the political division of your own land in the eye , ” scheel said .
“ we feared that such a step would create the impression that we were resigned .

in little over ten years , germany has taken part in operations in somalia , the balkans and afghanistan . although all but the most extreme pacifistic german parliamentarians now appear comfortable sending german troops overseas under a u.n. mandate , germany ’ s steadfast belief in using the world body to resolve international conflicts has created problems for the country ’ s once strong relations with the united states . angry america last year , chancellor schröder angered u.n. skeptic bush by saying germany would not support a u.n. resolution backing military action to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein no matter what .
as a rotating member of the security council , germany may not have a veto like permanent seat-holders such as france or russia , but schröder ’ s unyielding opposition left little room for diplomatic maneuver , likely emboldening other war opponents . “ germany without a doubt gained stature through its behavior during the iraq conflict , ” one high-ranking western diplomat told the german news agency dpa .
but at the same time , berlin ’ s newfound independence has also likely encouraged washington to put the kibosh on germany getting its own permanent seat on the security council for the foreseeable future . but such long-term german goals are likely not even on the agenda during schröder ’ s trip .

this time birthler won . for years now , the former german chancellor and the head of the authority that administers secret police files from the former east germany have locked horns over whether journalists and researchers should be given access to material compiled by stasi agents who spied on kohl during his 16 administration .
in 2001 , a german federal administrative court in karlsruhe ruled that kohl ’ s file must remain under seal because its release would violate his privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor helmut kohl however , the berlin court ruled on wednesday that kohl ’ s 7,000 page file should be made public based on an amendment to the federal law governing access to the stasi archive passed last year .
the change - opposed by kohl 's former colleagues in the opposition christian democratic party - allows information concerning prominent people to be published " as long as it refers to their historical role , function or exercise of office . "
" we see ourselves affirmed in our view , " the director of the stasi file archive , hans altendorf , said .
but he pointed out that kohl 's file could not be given to researchers or journalists until the ruling was final .
even before the court adjourned , marianne birthler predicted it would not put an end to the matter .
" it ’ s clear to all of us that the matter will end up before the federal court in karlsruhe once again .
in other words , we won ’ t obtain full clarity on the issue any time soon , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the authority that administers the stasi files indeed , kohl 's lawyers said the former chancellor would appeal the ruling .
kohl has made it clear he is prepared to pursue the issue at the highest judicial level , the constitutional court in karlsruhe .
kohl and his lawyers contend the ban on releasing personal data should be upheld and that the recent legal changes are unconstitutional .
" the law on the stasi files was primarily meant to protect the privacy of people who were spied on and investigated by -lsb- the stasi -rsb- so they would n't again become the stasi 's victims , " kohl said in a recent interview with the welt newspaper .
a smoking gun ?
kohl 's file is suspected of being mainly made up of transcripts of telephone conversations the stasi , the east german secret police , got from eavesdropping on him .
the christian democrat 's file could provide insight into the slush fund scandal he and other party members were implicated in .
the scandal ultimately led to the former chancellor 's resignation as the honorary chairman of the cdu in 2000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the court 's ruling against kohl is upheld , the decision would have sweeping implications .
until now , investigations into the stasi archives have largely been restricted to uncovering informants from the former east .
the focus has recently shifted to unmasking west german spies who worked for the east german secret police - a development that some fear could uncover explosive revelations about prominent germans if they are unable to block access to their files .
but another ruling in favor of kohl would also face criticism , since it could exacerbate rifts between east and west in a country still trying to come to terms with its recent history .
many eastern germans argue that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans who were spied on by the stasi and who , after reunification , were embarrassed by stasi file revelations long hidden in the archives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.09.2003 germany celebrates 30 years at the u.n. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has played a high-profile role at the u.n. security council since the war in iraq .
german chancellor gerhard schröder will fly next week to new york for a meeting of the united nations general assembly .
while there he will also attend festivities celebrating 30 years of german membership at the u.n. schröder will use his trip to reaffirm germany ’ s commitment to strengthening the united nations ’ role in resolving international conflicts .
but he will also take time to meet u.s. president george bush in an attempt to patch up german-american ties so badly damaged by disagreement over the war in iraq . though thursday will officially mark the 30th anniversary of german membership at the united nations , the party sponsored by the german u.n. mission won ’ t take place at new york ’ s swanky grand hyatt hotel until after schröder arrives on september 23 .
considering how dramatically germany ’ s role at the world forum has changed over the past three decades , most observers would agree there ’ s something to celebrate . membership delayed currently a high-profile rotating member of the u.n. security council , war-torn germany was not even considered for membership when the united nations was founded in 1945 .
the ensuing division of the country then delayed the process by some 20 years as west and east germany fought over international recognition .
only after west germany gave up its demand to be the only legitimate representative of the german people , did both nations become full members of the u.n. general assembly on september 18 , 1973 . only a few days later german foreign minster walter scheel addressed the issue that had keep west germany as nation with only “ active non-member ” status for so many years in his first speech at the united nations . “ do you understand why we hesitated to join the united nations ?
it is painful to look the political division of your own land in the eye , ” scheel said .
“ we feared that such a step would create the impression that we were resigned .
as if we had given up hope for unification . ” after unification in 1990 , the two german seats became one and modern germany began to orient its u.n. polices less on cold war realities and more on human rights , development and the peaceful resolution of conflicts .
the third largest u.n. donor following the united states and japan , germany now accounts for roughly ten percent of the u.n. budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in kabul , afghanistan .
as germany began to redefine its postwar role anew , it eventually came the watershed decision that german soldiers could once again be deployed abroad for peacekeeping missions that had u.n. backing .
in little over ten years , germany has taken part in operations in somalia , the balkans and afghanistan . although all but the most extreme pacifistic german parliamentarians now appear comfortable sending german troops overseas under a u.n. mandate , germany ’ s steadfast belief in using the world body to resolve international conflicts has created problems for the country ’ s once strong relations with the united states . angry america last year , chancellor schröder angered u.n. skeptic bush by saying germany would not support a u.n. resolution backing military action to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein no matter what .
as a rotating member of the security council , germany may not have a veto like permanent seat-holders such as france or russia , but schröder ’ s unyielding opposition left little room for diplomatic maneuver , likely emboldening other war opponents . “ germany without a doubt gained stature through its behavior during the iraq conflict , ” one high-ranking western diplomat told the german news agency dpa .
but at the same time , berlin ’ s newfound independence has also likely encouraged washington to put the kibosh on germany getting its own permanent seat on the security council for the foreseeable future . but such long-term german goals are likely not even on the agenda during schröder ’ s trip .
instead , he will be more concerned with showing bush that germany can still be america ’ s friend even if the two countries don ’ t always agree on every issue .
for his part , bush will hope he can get schröder to support a new u.n. resolution that would pave the way for more international participation in stabilizing iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign minsters fail to reach agreement on iraq 's future divided foreign ministers of the five permanent u.n. security council member countries ended a crucial meeting in geneva saturday with no major breakthrough on talks for international support for the u.s. in iraq .

german chancellor gerhard schröder will fly next week to new york for a meeting of the united nations general assembly .
while there he will also attend festivities celebrating 30 years of german membership at the u.n. schröder will use his trip to reaffirm germany ’ s commitment to strengthening the united nations ’ role in resolving international conflicts .
but he will also take time to meet u.s. president george bush in an attempt to patch up german-american ties so badly damaged by disagreement over the war in iraq . though thursday will officially mark the 30th anniversary of german membership at the united nations , the party sponsored by the german u.n. mission won ’ t take place at new york ’ s swanky grand hyatt hotel until after schröder arrives on september 23 .

the ensuing division of the country then delayed the process by some 20 years as west and east germany fought over international recognition .
only after west germany gave up its demand to be the only legitimate representative of the german people , did both nations become full members of the u.n. general assembly on september 18 , 1973 . only a few days later german foreign minster walter scheel addressed the issue that had keep west germany as nation with only “ active non-member ” status for so many years in his first speech at the united nations . “ do you understand why we hesitated to join the united nations ?
it is painful to look the political division of your own land in the eye , ” scheel said .

in little over ten years , germany has taken part in operations in somalia , the balkans and afghanistan . although all but the most extreme pacifistic german parliamentarians now appear comfortable sending german troops overseas under a u.n. mandate , germany ’ s steadfast belief in using the world body to resolve international conflicts has created problems for the country ’ s once strong relations with the united states . angry america last year , chancellor schröder angered u.n. skeptic bush by saying germany would not support a u.n. resolution backing military action to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein no matter what .
as a rotating member of the security council , germany may not have a veto like permanent seat-holders such as france or russia , but schröder ’ s unyielding opposition left little room for diplomatic maneuver , likely emboldening other war opponents . “ germany without a doubt gained stature through its behavior during the iraq conflict , ” one high-ranking western diplomat told the german news agency dpa .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .

career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term although the netherlands has n't even formally proposed jaap de hoop scheffer for nato secretary-general , the cards seem to be falling the foreign minister 's way .
nato insiders in brussels on wednesday confirmed a german newspaper report that alleged the dutch diplomat was the top candidate to lead the north atlantic alliance after the current head , the scot george robertson , completes his term in mid-december . the united states in particular is expected to support de hoop scheffer 's nomination .
the netherlands shored up washington in the iraq war .
" if it had been up to him the dutch would not only have bolstered -lsb- the americans -rsb- politically but also militarily , " the dutch de volkskrant newspaper recently wrote . canada and france , however , are still thought to have reservations about de hoop scheffer .
canada has put in its own bid , finance minister john manley , a former foreign minister , who is regarded as the only real competition since norwegian defense minister kristin krohn devold announced she would not pursue the top nato position last week . a european edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato headquarters in brussels but jaap de hoop scheffer has a strong edge over manley : he 's european .
europe has always provided the alliance with secretary generals , while the nato supreme commander in europe has traditionally been an american . france has denied its reservations stem from the desire to avoid putting a man in office who supported the war in iraq and the united states .
it has signaled its willingness to drop its reservations in a gesture of european solidarity , the dpa news agency reported . germany is also thought to favor the dutchman at nato 's helm .
and both the belgian government and norwegian defense minister devold have given their endorsement . a career in diplomacy de hoop scheffer has been his country 's foreign minister since july 2002 .
although his military experience is limited to two years mandatory military service in the dutch air force in the 1970s , which he completed as a reserve officer , it is his diplomatic career that makes him qualified for the top civilian position . the native amsterdamer studied law at the university of leiden , and joined the diplomatic service after finishing his military service .
from 1978 to 1980 he became acquainted with nato structures while working for the dutch delegation in brussels . de hoop scheffer had been tipped as a possible candidate for the next prime minister of the netherlands , where he 's a member of the christian democratic alliance .
if elected to head up nato , the 55-year-old would be the third dutch secretary general out of a total of ten in the alliance 's fifty-year history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing nato secretary general george robertson but the name of the next secretary general will not actually be made official until the alliance 's 19 member states have submitted their nomination and the nato council , the alliance 's top decision making body , has approved it - a process washinton 's envoy in brussels has said is as arcane as electing the pope . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato takes command of peacekeepers in afghanistan nato on monday took over the command of international peacekeeping troops in afghanistan from germany and the netherlands .

paris and berlin reinforced deepening ties thursday with the unveiling of a proposal to kick-start the flagging eu economy , even as the two heavyweights came under renewed fire for breaching euro zone stability criteria . europe 's german-french motor gathered momentum on thursday when the cabinets of both countries gathered in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- for a one-day joint meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and german cabinets in berlin .
the talks focussed chiefly on ways to inject fresh life into europe 's depressed economy , though they also touched upon the postwar situations in iraq and afghanistan .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder outlined a common initiative to stimulate growth across the european union and create more jobs .
the initiative goes beyond recent infrastructure proposals made by italy which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , and encompasses a host of investment projects worth billions of euro in areas ranging from research , telecommunications , information technology and biotechnology to transport and sustainable development .
the german-franco projects are meant to be primarily financed through low-interest loans from the luxembourg-based european investment bank .
they could also include high-profile projects like the planned berlin-brandenburg airport in berlin and the linking of the french high-speed train tgv with the ice in southwestern germany .
hans-martin bury , germany ’ s deputy minister for european affairs told the financial times ahead of thursday ’ s meeting , " the growth initiative will be about industry policy .
we have not become overnight advocates of fiscal stimuli , which we think are flashes in the pan .
what we want is to structurally improve the competitiveness of europe ’ s economy .
the eu commission welcomed the german-franco initiative on thursday .
" we ’ re very satisfied that the topic has been placed right at the top of the political agenda , " a spokesman for economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said in brussels .
paris , berlin urged to toe stability criteria but not everybody is happy with the new franco-german initiative to spur europe ’ s sluggish economy .
dieter hundt , head of the german employers ’ federation reacted cautiously to thursday ’ s outcome .
" what ’ s important is that we first do our homework , " he said in a reference to mounting criticism of the euro-zones ' two largest economies coming dangerously close to breaching the eu stability and growth pact .
the pact stipulates that euro zone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
both france and germany violated that limit last year and are almost certain to do it again this year .
eu member states austria and the netherlands stepped up criticism of the two heavyweights on thursday .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told german daily berliner zeitung that berlin and paris shouldn ’ t just endorse the stability pact with words , but also actions .
" the two countries are the architects of the pact .
they shouldn ’ t just push it aside , as soon as its rules become a little unpleasant , " he said .
his austrian counterpart karl-heinz grasser warned that the credibility of the stability pact was at stake .
differences on iraq surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder both schröder and chirac , who formed a unified anti-war front against the u.s.-led war in iraq , also reiterated demands on thursday to hand back power to an iraqi civil government as soon as possible .
both leaders stressed it was urgent to find a political solution to the situation in postwar iraq .
at the same time , differences between the two leaders were discernible on the issue of training iraqi police and soldiers .
while chirac insisted france wouldn ’ t support the u.s. before a u.n. resolution had been passed , schröder said ahead of the summit that germany was prepared to help train iraqi police and armed forces .
" the readiness to help with the training , is independent of a u.n. resolution , i ’ ve already agreed to that , " schröder said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt on thursday .
on the issue of afghanistan , chirac indicated his clear support for germany ’ s stance in favor of expanding the nato-led multinational isaf -lrb- international security -rrb- mandate beyond the capital of kabul .
france however doesn ’ t plan to increase the number of its peacekeeping soldiers stationed in afghanistan , currently at 500 .

paris and berlin reinforced deepening ties thursday with the unveiling of a proposal to kick-start the flagging eu economy , even as the two heavyweights came under renewed fire for breaching euro zone stability criteria . europe 's german-french motor gathered momentum on thursday when the cabinets of both countries gathered in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- for a one-day joint meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french and german cabinets in berlin .
the talks focussed chiefly on ways to inject fresh life into europe 's depressed economy , though they also touched upon the postwar situations in iraq and afghanistan .
french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder outlined a common initiative to stimulate growth across the european union and create more jobs .
the initiative goes beyond recent infrastructure proposals made by italy which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , and encompasses a host of investment projects worth billions of euro in areas ranging from research , telecommunications , information technology and biotechnology to transport and sustainable development .
the german-franco projects are meant to be primarily financed through low-interest loans from the luxembourg-based european investment bank .
they could also include high-profile projects like the planned berlin-brandenburg airport in berlin and the linking of the french high-speed train tgv with the ice in southwestern germany .
hans-martin bury , germany ’ s deputy minister for european affairs told the financial times ahead of thursday ’ s meeting , " the growth initiative will be about industry policy .
we have not become overnight advocates of fiscal stimuli , which we think are flashes in the pan .
what we want is to structurally improve the competitiveness of europe ’ s economy .
the eu commission welcomed the german-franco initiative on thursday .
" we ’ re very satisfied that the topic has been placed right at the top of the political agenda , " a spokesman for economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes said in brussels .
paris , berlin urged to toe stability criteria but not everybody is happy with the new franco-german initiative to spur europe ’ s sluggish economy .
dieter hundt , head of the german employers ’ federation reacted cautiously to thursday ’ s outcome .
" what ’ s important is that we first do our homework , " he said in a reference to mounting criticism of the euro-zones ' two largest economies coming dangerously close to breaching the eu stability and growth pact .
the pact stipulates that euro zone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
both france and germany violated that limit last year and are almost certain to do it again this year .
eu member states austria and the netherlands stepped up criticism of the two heavyweights on thursday .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm told german daily berliner zeitung that berlin and paris shouldn ’ t just endorse the stability pact with words , but also actions .
" the two countries are the architects of the pact .
they shouldn ’ t just push it aside , as soon as its rules become a little unpleasant , " he said .
his austrian counterpart karl-heinz grasser warned that the credibility of the stability pact was at stake .
differences on iraq surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac and schröder both schröder and chirac , who formed a unified anti-war front against the u.s.-led war in iraq , also reiterated demands on thursday to hand back power to an iraqi civil government as soon as possible .
both leaders stressed it was urgent to find a political solution to the situation in postwar iraq .
at the same time , differences between the two leaders were discernible on the issue of training iraqi police and soldiers .
while chirac insisted france wouldn ’ t support the u.s. before a u.n. resolution had been passed , schröder said ahead of the summit that germany was prepared to help train iraqi police and armed forces .
" the readiness to help with the training , is independent of a u.n. resolution , i ’ ve already agreed to that , " schröder said in an interview with business daily handelsblatt on thursday .
on the issue of afghanistan , chirac indicated his clear support for germany ’ s stance in favor of expanding the nato-led multinational isaf -lrb- international security -rrb- mandate beyond the capital of kabul .
france however doesn ’ t plan to increase the number of its peacekeeping soldiers stationed in afghanistan , currently at 500 .
the overall subject of europe 's position on iraq will top the agenda at a high profile trilateral summit with great britain on saturday , when british prime tony blair seeks to find common ground on deadlocked talks at the u.n. security council with schröder and chirac . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and france forge stronger bond dw-world 's dossier on the deepening german-franco relationship . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

lawyers representing the plaintiffs opposing the drug , which has been linked to more than 100 deaths and side-effects such as muscle wasting before it was withdrawn from the market in 2001 , sought to fight bayer in three class group cases : those that suffered injury from the drug , those who needed medical monitoring to inhibit future illness caused by the drug , and those who should get a refund for the drug .
the judge ruled that were too many complexities to fold into one national lawsuit .
the company has attempted to settle cases tied to the drug but has fought vigorously against what it says are the many unsubstantiated claims that have been brought to court . more briefs 18.09.2003 -pipe- vw appeal against antitrust fine rejected 18.09.2003 -pipe- .info opens market for german domain names 18.09.2003 -pipe- e-plus extends german gsm / gprs network 17.09.2003 -pipe- report : proposed eu laws threaten chemical industry 17.09.2003 -pipe- westlb cuts 900 jobs in redundancy plan 17.09.2003 -pipe- infineon invests $ 1.2 billion in china 17.09.2003 -pipe- siemens ceo admonishes german complacency 16.09.2003 -pipe- more optimism as confidence indicator rises radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

lawyers representing the plaintiffs opposing the drug , which has been linked to more than 100 deaths and side-effects such as muscle wasting before it was withdrawn from the market in 2001 , sought to fight bayer in three class group cases : those that suffered injury from the drug , those who needed medical monitoring to inhibit future illness caused by the drug , and those who should get a refund for the drug .
the judge ruled that were too many complexities to fold into one national lawsuit .
the company has attempted to settle cases tied to the drug but has fought vigorously against what it says are the many unsubstantiated claims that have been brought to court . more briefs 18.09.2003 -pipe- vw appeal against antitrust fine rejected 18.09.2003 -pipe- .info opens market for german domain names 18.09.2003 -pipe- e-plus extends german gsm / gprs network 17.09.2003 -pipe- report : proposed eu laws threaten chemical industry 17.09.2003 -pipe- westlb cuts 900 jobs in redundancy plan 17.09.2003 -pipe- infineon invests $ 1.2 billion in china 17.09.2003 -pipe- siemens ceo admonishes german complacency 16.09.2003 -pipe- more optimism as confidence indicator rises radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
dw-world talked to acclaimed novelist anita desai at berlin 's international literature festival about her book " baumgartner ’ s bombay , ” her german-indian roots and how the collision of cultures has shaped her writing . born in 1937 in north india to a bengali father and a german mother , anita desai ’ s unique background reads like a character in one of her many novels .
as one of the first indian authors to write and publish in english , desai ’ s works are immersed in indian life , her characters mainly drawn from middle-class english-speaking india .
the theme of inter-cultural connections and alienation is one that runs throughout her many novels and short story collections .
since publishing her first story at the age of nine , the popular author has won several literary awards and been nominated three times for the prestigious booker prize .
the 1988 novel , baumgartner ’ s bombay focuses on desai ’ s own german-indian connection .
it marks a departure from her earlier works and is in the author ’ s own words " an attempt to capture the outsider ’ s view of india . "
it is the story of hugo baumgartner , a jewish teenager in berlin , who is sent to india to escape the nazis after his family suffers the collapse of their fine-furniture business . imprisoned in india as a hostile alien during the war years , baumgartner eventually moves to bombay at war ’ s end and spends his time as a lonely old man in a rundown apartment , caring for stray cats and yearning for the german language .
a perpetual outsider , baumgartner remains unaccepted in indian society where he ’ s just a firanghi or fair-skinned foreigner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baumgartner 's bombay by anita desai dw-world spoke to anita desai about the making of baumgartner ’ s bombay , her german heritage and memories of an indian childhood peppered with german lullabies , and the reconciling of two quite different cultures .
is baumgartner ’ s bombay a personal family story ?
not exactly .
i wanted to write about the german part of my background and my german heritage , yet i didn ’ t know how to fit it in an indian context .
you can write about the british easily enough , but how do you write about a german in india ?
it took me a long time , casting around for a subject – there were some people like him in my mother ’ s circle .
it ’ s a strange thing , but the name " baumgartner ’ s bombay " seemed to just fall out of the sky , once i had the title , i was able to uncover the rest and invent the story .
baumgartner lives half a century in india and yet never comes to terms with it .
is that a typical experience of one in exile or is that typical of india ?
i thought of it as a certain period of history , a certain time when the world was shaken up and seemed to go through these upheavals every so often .
and baumgartner just happened to land in india - a country which holds nothing for him , means nothing to him .
so he remains the outsider , just happy to survive .
i think this happens to a lot of people in the course of history .
it was my vision of human life being taken up by history which tramples on them , which rolls them flat out of its way .
much the same thing is happening today all over the world .
your german mother came to india under different circumstances .
how did she adapt ?
my mother ’ s situation was different .
she met and married my father here in berlin and came to india as a bride , much adored by my father ’ s family .
she did adapt quickly but i think it must have been through a great deal of self-sacrifice and a great deal of wisdom .
she used to tell me that her mother told her before she left for india , ‘ don ’ t bring up your children to think that they are german , they ’ ll only be unhappy living in india . ’
and my mother did exactly that , we were surprised if anyone mentioned she was german .
we ’ d forgotten it ourselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anita desai was there ever a conflict between your german and indian roots , growing up during the war years ?
i just realized that our home was somewhat different from other indian homes and mine just happened to be somewhat european .
my mother seemed to adapt to indian life very comfortably and very well , but certainly a part of me was aware that she was not an indian woman , she was s a european woman and very often the ideas she would express were obviously western ones .
i was aware that she thought of india differently - her reactions to it were analytical , rational , intellectual .
my father ’ s and mine were much more emotional and instinctive .
we did speak german at home , but never outside the home .
of course there were also a lot of british and american troops in india at the time and my older brother and sister were much more conscious of the political situation than i was .
i remember they told my mother ‘ don ’ t wear dresses out on the streets , please wear saris , and don ’ t speak to us in german . ’
that was for her own safety .
baumgartner spent six years in an internment camp as a german in india because the anglo-indian authorities didn ’ t differentiate between germans and jews .
what kind of camps were they ?
it ’ s actually a forgotten part of world war ii .
there were such camps in india , and all those the british considered alien were interned there during the war years .
some of my mother ’ s circle did spend the war years there and came out with a lot of stories , which i incorporated in a chapter .
the internment camp was not a horror camp or a concentration camp .
the inmates weren ’ t mistreated , but it was so much time taken out of their real lives that everything was in suspension .
my mother avoided that because she was an indian citizen , she had given up her german citizenship .
baumgartner has an intense yearning for the german language in the book , a yearning for the mother tongue , is that something your mother had too ?
my mother was a wonderful storyteller and we would go to bed listening to german lullabies and wonderful stories of christmas or easter in germany .
to us they were like fairytales , we never thought of as being real .
i didn ’ t realize that when i was young , but as i grew up i realized what an immense well of nostalgia and homesickness my mother must have felt for germany .
so i wanted to pay a tribute to the language in the book considering the fact that language contains the culture of a country .
even baumgartner who has left germany with nothing at all has his language and he holds on to it .
when did you become aware of the real germany and how did that translate into your writing ?
i remember when germany ’ s defeat in the war was declared and we heard it on the radio .
i ’ ll never forget the expression on my mother ’ s face - perhaps that was when germany became real to me .
history was revealed at a later stage , one didn ’ t know of it till the war was over .
after that the news started coming in and understandably , it was not something my mother wanted to discuss .
so when i started writing baumgartner ’ s bombay , that ’ s when i really started seriously researching germany and world war ii and learned a lot that i ’ d never heard from my mother .
of course , she only wanted to remember the happy times in her own childhood , she never wanted to confront what happened during the war .
in fact she never returned to germany .
what does it feel like to be in a berlin so far removed from your mother ’ s memories ?
i don ’ t think my mother would be able to recognize this city which she left in the 1920s .
as i go around the city , everything seems so new , so real , that i ’ m confident she wouldn ’ t recognize anything .
in that sense , it ’ s a new city to me too , it ’ s not in the least bit like the berlin she grew up in ...
berlin is a modern city , it doesn ’ t belong to my mother ’ s era at all .
the only thing that connects me with it is that i enjoy hearing the language again because i ’ m so cut off from it . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitler , bose and a common enemy subhas chandra bose , who raised an army in exile to fight the british , is revered as a freedom-fighter and patriotic icon in india .

mr grasso has been under mounting pressure to go since details of his benefits and incentives package were revealed by the nyse last month .
attempts to find a swift replacement for mr grasso foundered on wednesday night when california lawyer larry sonsini turned down the job of interim chairman , reuters news agency reported .
instead , nyse 's board has named existing board member carl mccall as its lead director .
although large salaries are a way of life on wall street , the sheer scale of mr grasso 's deal raised questions about potential conflicts of interest .
swift action us regulators wanted to know how mr grasso could be paid so much by the very organisation he was meant to be regulating .
the new york exchange is also under pressure to take the lead on corporate governance after financial scandals such as worldcom and enron .
the issue is also to establish a model for the entire financial community of good corporate governance alan hevesi , new york state comptroller have your say : is mr grasso right to quit ?
mr grasso tendered his resignation at an emergency board meeting .
" dick offered to submit his resignation if the board requested , and the board did so and accepted that resignation , " said mr mccall , who chaired the meeting .
" every single director on our conversation discussed the great job that dick has done as chairman and chief executive , " mr mccall added .
in a statement , mr grasso said : " for the past 36 years , i have had the honour and privilege of working for what i believe is the greatest equities market in the world - the new york stock exchange .
" today , i shared with the board of directors in a conference call that , with the deepest reluctance and if the board so desired , i would submit my resignation as chairman and chief executive officer . "
he added : " i believe this course is in the best interests of both the exchange and myself . "
reform agenda new york 's state comptroller alan hevesi. who has led calls for mr grasso 's resignation , said it was " best for the new york stock exchange " .
but mr hevesi , who is the trustee of new york state 's $ 105bn pension fund , said the issue of trust in the financial system stretched beyond mr grasso .
" the issue is making fundamental reforms at the stock exchange to restore investor confidence .
" the issue is also to establish a model for the entire financial community of good corporate governance , accountability and disclosure .
" now that mr. grasso has stepped down , we can move forward with those reforms , " he said in a statement .
mr grasso , who started on the trading floor of the nyse and was the first chairman to be elected from its ranks , received much credit for increasing the number of listings on the exchange .
he was also praised for getting trading started again after 11 september - for which he is reported to have received a bonus of $ 5m .
escalating fees mr grasso insisted he did nothing to influence his pay .
but news of the $ 140m package of accrued savings , benefits and incentives he was due to receive led to resentment among traders .
the additional news that mr grasso had forgone an additional $ 48m he was entitled to failed to diffuse the row .
brokerage firms and traders were also thought to be unhappy at escalating nyse fees .
and some of america 's biggest pension funds also expressed concern , even hinting they may switch their business to other trading systems .
all that - coupled with a new mood of corporate probity in the us - made mr grasso 's position increasingly untenable .
' ethical leadership ' the campaign to oust mr grasso took on a political dimension in the past 24 hours , with democratic senator and presidential candidate joseph lieberman calling for his resignation .
" instead of setting an example of ethical leadership for the market he oversees , mr grasso 's behaviour has shaken the faith of investors and the foundation of the stock exchange , " he said .
the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- , which is investigating the pay deal , also requested more information on the package .
" we will be asking the nyse some further questions , based on information we 've received , " sec chairman william donaldson told a house of representatives financial services committee hearing .
e-mail this to a friend printable version watch and listen the bbc 's john terrett " the reason behind mr grasso 's resignation was a loss of investor confidence " james needham , ex nyse chairman " the free enterprise system is cracking apart .

earlier this week , mr iwan was unveiled as the new plaid president , while mr jones won the poll to lead the party in the welsh assembly .

party members at the three-day conference will now expect their new leaders to reveal how they intend to turn plaid 's fortunes around .
both want to focus on the party 's constitutional ambitions for wales , with the long-term aim of full membership of the european union .

this party of wales is your party and the party of everyone who has chosen wales to have their home " dafydd iwan mr jones used to perform the role of both president and group leader , but the role was split after he stepped down .
party vice-president mr iwan beat cynog dafis for the presidency by 855 votes .
mr iwan won 2,980 votes against mr dafis ' 2,125 .
mr jones , the assembly member for ynys mon , narrowly beat helen mary jones by 71 votes .
he won 2,603 votes , against helen mary jones ' 2,532 .
a third candidate , carmarthen east and dinefwr am rhodri glyn thomas , polled 1,014 in the first round of votes , which were then transferred to the other candidates on the basis of the voters ' second preferences .
after the result mr jones called on his party to unite .
he said plaid must be at the forefront of the campaign to turn the assembly into a powerful parliament with greater powers .
he added : " the party must work together from top to bottom - the assembly group , at westminster , in europe and in local government , as a united party pulling together . "
mr iwan said it was an " honour and a privilege " to lead the party of welsh freedom .
he said he looked forward to the job with immense enjoyment .
" this party of wales is your party and the party of everyone who has chosen wales to have their home , " he said .

but ian taylor , flybe 's general manager in jersey , told bbc news online : " we live in an era of competition .
" there is an opportunity for significantly lower fares than that . "

the airline is also hoping to run flights from manchester .

it has taken two and a half years to finish , at a cost of $ 800m .
the new railway has been built across some of the world 's most inhospitable territory .
it will provide what has been described as a " land bridge " from southern australia to the port of darwin and beyond into asia .
a railway across the unforgiving " red centre " has been a dream for australians for generations .
in the early 1980s , the former prime minister malcolm fraser announced it would be built within five years .
a number of factors conspired to derail such optimism , including the cost and the sheer hostility of the terrain .
in the summer , temperatures reach 50c in the shade .
on top of that , there is a three-month monsoon season .
trade link for most of its length , australia 's newest railway line runs along a small embankment through the tanami desert .
it stretches for more than 1,400 km -lrb- 870 miles -rrb- over 90 bridges .
its main purpose will be transporting freight between adelaide in the south and tropical darwin in the north .
the journey will take almost two days .
the famous " ghan " passenger train will also travel on the new route .
services are scheduled to start in the new year .
there are high hopes the trans-continental link will make australia 's trade with its asian neighbours quicker and more profitable .
the alice springs to darwin scheme is jointly managed by the south australian and northern territory governments .
the design , construction and day-to-day running of the railway are the responsibility of a private consortium .

by caroline ryan bbc news online health staff many people tell the odd white lie - taking a day off " sick " or halving the amount they spend on a shopping trip .
but most feel a little bit guilty about the deception .
scientists have now found that twinge of conscience can be seen in increased activity in the brain .
in short , it takes more effort to lie than to tell the truth . "
if they have had at least one good relationship with an adult figure , they do n't become delinquent " dr sean spence but people with psychopathic tendencies find lying as easy as telling the truth .
the reason is that when children develop the ability to deceive - around the age of three of four - they also develop the ability to empathise .
but researchers say people with aggressive and antisocial personality disorders do not develop this ability , and therefore they have no moral compass .
they say traumatic experiences and a lack of contact with understanding adults could be to blame .
' deception is ok ' the reasons why some people become psychopathic will be discussed at a conference in sheffield entitled " psychopathy and the problem of evil " .
dr sean spence of the university of sheffield , who is chairing the conference , has found parts of the frontal lobe area of the brain are more active when someone was lying than when they were telling the truth .
he will prevent evidence confirming earlier studies which showed the neurological activity involved in lying .
dr spence said : " when we 're lying , there is a moral part of us that does n't wish to manipulate others or take advantage of them .
" in psychopaths , there is no activity in that area of the brain , and deception is ok to them .
" they do n't have any qualms about doing it . "
he said a lack of adults displaying empathy towards them as children meant psychopaths could not learn from example , and developed the aggressive antisocial personality disorder .
" if they have experienced gross sexual abuse of severe physical violence , they may never have been in contact with the feeling of empathy . "
dr spence said ' good parenting ' was a crucial part of preventing these tendencies developing .
" even if people have had an experience such as sexual abuse , if they have had at least one good relationship with an adult figure , they do n't become delinquent . "
diet and exercise childhood diets could also influence whether people develop psychopathic tendencies , experts say .
the conference will hear from professor adrian raine , a psychologist from the university of california .
he gave a group of three-year-olds from mauritius a programme of an enriched diet , exercise and cognitive stimulation - being read to and involved in conversation .
by the age of 11 , they showed increased activity on brain scan readings , and by 23 , they were 64 % less likely than a group of children who had not been on the programme to have criminal records .
professor raine said : " this is not a silver bullet to solving crime and violence , but i think it 's certainly one of the ingredients .
" the take-home point is that the seeds of crime are sown early in life . "
dr spence added that alcohol or drug abuse could also cause damage to the brain and cause psychopathic behaviour .
but he said that even people who had never before shown any signs of psychopathic behaviour could behave very cruelly in extreme situations .
" in rwanda , around 800,000 people were killed in 100 days .
" most people doing the killing had been ' normal ' before - it was something in their environment that changed . "

but researchers say people with aggressive and antisocial personality disorders do not develop this ability , and therefore they have no moral compass .
they say traumatic experiences and a lack of contact with understanding adults could be to blame .
' deception is ok ' the reasons why some people become psychopathic will be discussed at a conference in sheffield entitled " psychopathy and the problem of evil " .
dr sean spence of the university of sheffield , who is chairing the conference , has found parts of the frontal lobe area of the brain are more active when someone was lying than when they were telling the truth .
he will prevent evidence confirming earlier studies which showed the neurological activity involved in lying .
dr spence said : " when we 're lying , there is a moral part of us that does n't wish to manipulate others or take advantage of them .
" in psychopaths , there is no activity in that area of the brain , and deception is ok to them .
" they do n't have any qualms about doing it . "
he said a lack of adults displaying empathy towards them as children meant psychopaths could not learn from example , and developed the aggressive antisocial personality disorder .
" if they have experienced gross sexual abuse of severe physical violence , they may never have been in contact with the feeling of empathy . "
dr spence said ' good parenting ' was a crucial part of preventing these tendencies developing .
" even if people have had an experience such as sexual abuse , if they have had at least one good relationship with an adult figure , they do n't become delinquent . "
diet and exercise childhood diets could also influence whether people develop psychopathic tendencies , experts say .
the conference will hear from professor adrian raine , a psychologist from the university of california .
he gave a group of three-year-olds from mauritius a programme of an enriched diet , exercise and cognitive stimulation - being read to and involved in conversation .
by the age of 11 , they showed increased activity on brain scan readings , and by 23 , they were 64 % less likely than a group of children who had not been on the programme to have criminal records .
professor raine said : " this is not a silver bullet to solving crime and violence , but i think it 's certainly one of the ingredients .
" the take-home point is that the seeds of crime are sown early in life . "
dr spence added that alcohol or drug abuse could also cause damage to the brain and cause psychopathic behaviour .
but he said that even people who had never before shown any signs of psychopathic behaviour could behave very cruelly in extreme situations .
" in rwanda , around 800,000 people were killed in 100 days .
" most people doing the killing had been ' normal ' before - it was something in their environment that changed . "

a very small quantity of the dye was found but as a precaution we are recalling everything sainsbury 's statement a spokesman for unilever bestfoods , which makes bertolli , said : " the dye was identified by our supplier in italy during quality assured checks and they notified us .
" the brand is certainly well known but the one we have named is the only product with chilli powder in . "
a sainsbury 's spokeswoman said : " a very small quantity of the dye was found but as a precaution we are recalling everything . "
consumers with jars of the bertolli sauce can get further information by phoning a special recall number -lrb- 0800 -rrb- 146 252 .
the food standard 's agency said members of the public and retailers who had purchased a contaminated product , with a date code between may and september 2005 inclusive , should either throw it away , or return it to the supplier and request a refund .

the pentagon 's decision was announced by republican senator john mccain , a member of the senate armed services committee who has been pushing for an inquiry into the deal .
the pentagon 's inspector general joseph schmitz reportedly told a congressional committee on wednesday that " sufficient credible information exists to warrant the initiation of an investigation " .
the allegations - which boeing reject - stem from a contract , worth at least $ 22bn -lrb- £ 13.6bn -rrb- , to provide the us military with refuelling tankers .
fierce rivals the us air force decided in december 2001 to lease 100 boeing 767 planes and convert them to refuelling tankers before eventually buying them outright .
boeing has rejected claims that it was fed unfair information about airbus ' pricing by pentagon officials .
" boeing has said all along that we believe we received no proprietary information from any individual at any time at any time on any subject throughout the entire tanker lease process , " company spokesman doug kennett said .
the deal was criticised at the time as expensive , with some us lawmakers arguing that the pentagon needed to lease only a quarter of the planes .
the decision to go ahead with a formal inquiry is thought be based on e-mails found during an initial investigation .
mr mccain made his name as an anti-corruption campaigner when he ran from the republican nomination in the 2000 us presidential election .
boeing and airbus are rivals in a market which has got much tighter since the 11 september attacks on the world trade centre precipitated a downturn in civilian air travel .

the barbastelle bat , which measures just 4.5 centimetres from head to toe , was discovered in a piece woodland next to which the new , proposed highway would run .
the conservation charity the woodland trust is now threatening legal action to stop dorset county council approving the transport plans .
the animal , known to scientists as barbastella barbastellus , is on the government 's biodiversity action plan , which means there is official concern about its continued existence in the uk .
it turned up along with other bat species in a survey commissioned by the trust to see what was living in a corner of ancient woodland called two mile coppice .
pug ugly the trust , which owns the coppice , fears the road could do irreparable damage to what is a site of special scientific interest .
the current proposals would see the by-pass built on the edge of the woodland and run parallel to a railway line on a raised embankment .
the plans have already been altered once this year to limit their environmental impact - again because of concern about bat roosts .
" the barbastelle is probably one of our rarest species , " john stobart from english nature , the government 's wildlife advisory body , told bbc news online .
their pug-like faces made them look ugly to some , he said .
despite their small body size , a wingspan of around 25 cm enabled them to travel up to 18 kilometres in one night , he added .
licence to build no barbastelle breeding roosts have been officially recorded in dorset and only a single pregnant female was found in a previous study in the county .
since their calls are silent to us , they are very difficult to track down .
the woodland trust survey used high-tech bat detectors to identify calls .
their survey also picked up the presence of pipistrelle , noctule and possibly even bechstein 's bats in the ancient woodland .
wild bats in the uk are protected by the 1981 wildlife and countryside act .
therefore , any development that affects wild bats requires a licence from the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- .
a spokesperson for dorset county council indicated they would seek a licence : " even if the bats are there , it does not mean that there will be no relief road .
" if the bat presence is confirmed then we will seek a licence from government and the road can still go ahead . "
uk 's ' rainforests ' the woodland trust plans to commission a more detailed study of the bats in the woodland and says it would consider a legal challenge to any licence .
" the ongoing existence of the ancient woodland habitat will be threatened if the road goes ahead , " said graham bradley , of the woodland trust .
ancient woodland - defined as land continuously wooded for at least 400 years - now covers just 2 % of the uk .
conservation groups say every effort should be made to protect what remains of " britain 's rainforests " , because of the very diverse wildlife they host , such as the endangered dormouse .
the weymouth relief road is designed to ease congestion into the town .
if built it would substantially improve the quality of life for hundreds of people living along dorchester road and preston road which carry the traffic at the moment .
the escalating costs resulting from environmental concerns have angered local politicians .

one of the rarest species in the uk -lrb- image by bct / hugh clark -rrb- the barbastelle bat , which measures just 4.5 centimetres from head to toe , was discovered in a piece woodland next to which the new , proposed highway would run .
the conservation charity the woodland trust is now threatening legal action to stop dorset county council approving the transport plans .
the animal , known to scientists as barbastella barbastellus , is on the government 's biodiversity action plan , which means there is official concern about its continued existence in the uk .
it turned up along with other bat species in a survey commissioned by the trust to see what was living in a corner of ancient woodland called two mile coppice .
pug ugly the trust , which owns the coppice , fears the road could do irreparable damage to what is a site of special scientific interest .
the current proposals would see the by-pass built on the edge of the woodland and run parallel to a railway line on a raised embankment .
the plans have already been altered once this year to limit their environmental impact - again because of concern about bat roosts .
" the barbastelle is probably one of our rarest species , " john stobart from english nature , the government 's wildlife advisory body , told bbc news online .
their pug-like faces made them look ugly to some , he said .
despite their small body size , a wingspan of around 25 cm enabled them to travel up to 18 kilometres in one night , he added .
licence to build no barbastelle breeding roosts have been officially recorded in dorset and only a single pregnant female was found in a previous study in the county .
since their calls are silent to us , they are very difficult to track down .
the woodland trust survey used high-tech bat detectors to identify calls .
their survey also picked up the presence of pipistrelle , noctule and possibly even bechstein 's bats in the ancient woodland .
wild bats in the uk are protected by the 1981 wildlife and countryside act .
therefore , any development that affects wild bats requires a licence from the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- .
a spokesperson for dorset county council indicated they would seek a licence : " even if the bats are there , it does not mean that there will be no relief road .
" if the bat presence is confirmed then we will seek a licence from government and the road can still go ahead . "
uk 's ' rainforests ' the woodland trust plans to commission a more detailed study of the bats in the woodland and says it would consider a legal challenge to any licence .
" the ongoing existence of the ancient woodland habitat will be threatened if the road goes ahead , " said graham bradley , of the woodland trust .
ancient woodland - defined as land continuously wooded for at least 400 years - now covers just 2 % of the uk .
conservation groups say every effort should be made to protect what remains of " britain 's rainforests " , because of the very diverse wildlife they host , such as the endangered dormouse .
the weymouth relief road is designed to ease congestion into the town .
if built it would substantially improve the quality of life for hundreds of people living along dorchester road and preston road which carry the traffic at the moment .
the escalating costs resulting from environmental concerns have angered local politicians .
