" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .
the organizers of the world cup in germany have set aside € 300,000 -lrb- $ 326,900 -rrb- for ecological investment ; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister juergen trittin .
" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .
organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament .
plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food and drink refuse is a problem being tackled by " green goal " .
refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event .
with visitors to the 2006 world cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands , the " green goal " operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority .
as a result , spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates .
this will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on june 9 , 2006 .
the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .
enbw ag , one of three 2006 fifa world cup official energy suppliers , will supply electricity derived from renewable sources .
tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .
in an attempt to address the most demanding goal of reducing negative effects on the global climate , these emissions will be balanced by investment in environmental protection in other areas . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work begins on munich 's new football stadium construction has begun on munich 's new state-of-the-art football stadium , the allianz arena , in readiness for the 2006 world cup .

that suggests that it may be controllable , fleischer said . virologist christian drosten , also from the hamburg institute , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that one would have to be coughed on by an infected person to contract sars .
the disease is transmitted through exhaled droplets and bodily secretions . fatal in few cases sars is highly contagious , comparable to the ebola virus that stemmed from monkeys and was responsible for hundreds of deaths in africa in the 1990s , according to the world health organization .
virologist drosten said the sars disease is fatal for 4 percent of patients , while the zaire strain of ebola kills 90 percent of the people who contract it . on monday , a who spokesperson said the world body was close to identifying the cause of sars .
" we can identify the causative agent within a few days , but we are not sure if we can develop the cure in such a short time , hitoshi oshitani , regional advisor on communicable diseases , told a press conference in manila , philippines . "
who established an international research project consisting of eleven labs in ten countries on march 17 to find the virus that causes sars . origin in asia according to the who , the first case of the disease was reported in hanoi , vietnam in late february .
in guangdong , china , however , investigation is underway to determine whether an outbreak of " atypical " pneumonia in november 2002 was linked to the appearance of sars .
researchers fear that farmers ' livestock in the southern chinese province may have infected humans . the main symptoms of sars are high fever -lrb- above 38 ° c / 100.4 ° f -rrb- , a dry cough , shortness of breath or breathing difficulties .
it has an incubation period of two to seven days .
to avoid transmitting the disease , patients are put in quarantine . over 1,600 cases of sars have been reported worldwide .

forget viagra : german scientists are claiming that a daily bratwurst is enough to improve potency in middle-aged males by over 60 percent . ageing lotharios and sexually-frustrated wives and girlfriends are breathing a sigh of relief today , with the news that a daily german sausage can increase male potency by up to 63 percent . german scientists at the bad kissingen institute for sexual behaviour say that the effect on the male libido is virtually the same as taking viagra . in clinical tests carried out over five years , the researchers found that eating a daily bratwurst increased potency and sex drive in males over 50 by over 63 percent in most cases .
the secret , so the scientists say , lies in the distinct mixture of herbs and spices in the german national dish and has an extraordinary effect on male sexual behaviour if eaten over a long period .
bratwurst is a traditional german pork and veal sausage , seasoned with a secret mix of herbs and spices including ginger , marjoram , caraway and coriander .

" my girlfriend is a bit younger than me and i was getting slightly concerned about , well , you know what , " he admitted shyly .
" but this bratwurst trick has got me feeling like a spring chicken again . "
schmatzer said his girlfriend stocked up on sausages three times a week to make sure they would now never run out of the natural love drug . but the researchers cautioned that the effects did vary according to the male 's natural sex drive .

" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .
the organizers of the world cup in germany have set aside € 300,000 -lrb- $ 326,900 -rrb- for ecological investment ; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister juergen trittin .
" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .
organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament .
plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food and drink refuse is a problem being tackled by " green goal " .
refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event .
with visitors to the 2006 world cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands , the " green goal " operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority .
as a result , spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates .
this will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on june 9 , 2006 .
the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .
enbw ag , one of three 2006 fifa world cup official energy suppliers , will supply electricity derived from renewable sources .
tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .
in an attempt to address the most demanding goal of reducing negative effects on the global climate , these emissions will be balanced by investment in environmental protection in other areas . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work begins on munich 's new football stadium construction has begun on munich 's new state-of-the-art football stadium , the allianz arena , in readiness for the 2006 world cup .

at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . “ the social cuts in their current form would plunge vast numbers of the unemployed into a financial emergency , ” said ursula engelen-kefer , the deputy leader of the german trade union federation .

" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .
the organizers of the world cup in germany have set aside € 300,000 -lrb- $ 326,900 -rrb- for ecological investment ; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister juergen trittin .
" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .
organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament .
plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food and drink refuse is a problem being tackled by " green goal " .
refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event .
with visitors to the 2006 world cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands , the " green goal " operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority .
as a result , spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates .
this will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on june 9 , 2006 .
the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .
enbw ag , one of three 2006 fifa world cup official energy suppliers , will supply electricity derived from renewable sources .
tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .

several top german trade union leaders on tuesday attacked the government ’ s proposed plans to trim the welfare state and boost the economy only hours ahead of a meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder . “ it ’ s going in the wrong direction , ” klaus wiesehügel , head of mining union ig bau , told zdf television , referring to german chancellor schröder ’ s proposed cuts in unemployment benefits and loosening of job protection . schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . “ the social cuts in their current form would plunge vast numbers of the unemployed into a financial emergency , ” said ursula engelen-kefer , the deputy leader of the german trade union federation .
she called for nationwide union protests against the reforms . economy stalls but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .

he said he was willing to discuss details with the union leaders , but not the overall course of his polices . whether schröder will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda remains to be seen , however , as some social democratic mps may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party . reforms to timid for opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany is at a five-year high many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . but business leaders and the conservative opposition say schröder ’ s reforms don ’ t go far enough and have begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor . friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , even if it agreed with the general direction of the reforms .

tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .

" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .

" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .

the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .

" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .
the organizers of the world cup in germany have set aside € 300,000 -lrb- $ 326,900 -rrb- for ecological investment ; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister juergen trittin .
" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .
organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament .
plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food and drink refuse is a problem being tackled by " green goal " .
refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event .
with visitors to the 2006 world cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands , the " green goal " operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority .
as a result , spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates .
this will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on june 9 , 2006 .
the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .
enbw ag , one of three 2006 fifa world cup official energy suppliers , will supply electricity derived from renewable sources .
tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .
in an attempt to address the most demanding goal of reducing negative effects on the global climate , these emissions will be balanced by investment in environmental protection in other areas . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work begins on munich 's new football stadium construction has begun on munich 's new state-of-the-art football stadium , the allianz arena , in readiness for the 2006 world cup .

forget viagra : german scientists are claiming that a daily bratwurst is enough to improve potency in middle-aged males by over 60 percent . ageing lotharios and sexually-frustrated wives and girlfriends are breathing a sigh of relief today , with the news that a daily german sausage can increase male potency by up to 63 percent . german scientists at the bad kissingen institute for sexual behaviour say that the effect on the male libido is virtually the same as taking viagra . in clinical tests carried out over five years , the researchers found that eating a daily bratwurst increased potency and sex drive in males over 50 by over 63 percent in most cases .
the secret , so the scientists say , lies in the distinct mixture of herbs and spices in the german national dish and has an extraordinary effect on male sexual behaviour if eaten over a long period .

" my girlfriend is a bit younger than me and i was getting slightly concerned about , well , you know what , " he admitted shyly .
" but this bratwurst trick has got me feeling like a spring chicken again . "

several top german trade union leaders on tuesday attacked the government ’ s proposed plans to trim the welfare state and boost the economy only hours ahead of a meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder . “ it ’ s going in the wrong direction , ” klaus wiesehügel , head of mining union ig bau , told zdf television , referring to german chancellor schröder ’ s proposed cuts in unemployment benefits and loosening of job protection . schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . “ the social cuts in their current form would plunge vast numbers of the unemployed into a financial emergency , ” said ursula engelen-kefer , the deputy leader of the german trade union federation .
she called for nationwide union protests against the reforms . economy stalls but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . “ i expect agenda 2010 to be implemented point for point , ” schröder said at a press conference on monday .
he said he was willing to discuss details with the union leaders , but not the overall course of his polices . whether schröder will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda remains to be seen , however , as some social democratic mps may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party . reforms to timid for opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany is at a five-year high many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . but business leaders and the conservative opposition say schröder ’ s reforms don ’ t go far enough and have begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor . friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , even if it agreed with the general direction of the reforms .
“ he ’ ll have to get his own majority in parliament and then we ’ ll decide whether we vote for it or not , ” merz told reuters . the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
tuesday ’ s meeting was seen as an attempt to get organized labor on board , but in light of the withering attack from union leaders , the government was already playing down expectations . “ there is understanding that there can ’ t be agreement on all issues , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz .
but he said the unions could be certain that the proposals would be socially balanced . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces internal opposition to reforms schröder calls for germans to prepare for sacrifices tackling the reform problems of germany 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

several top german trade union leaders on tuesday attacked the government ’ s proposed plans to trim the welfare state and boost the economy only hours ahead of a meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder . “ it ’ s going in the wrong direction , ” klaus wiesehügel , head of mining union ig bau , told zdf television , referring to german chancellor schröder ’ s proposed cuts in unemployment benefits and loosening of job protection . schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . “ the social cuts in their current form would plunge vast numbers of the unemployed into a financial emergency , ” said ursula engelen-kefer , the deputy leader of the german trade union federation .
she called for nationwide union protests against the reforms . economy stalls but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . “ i expect agenda 2010 to be implemented point for point , ” schröder said at a press conference on monday .
he said he was willing to discuss details with the union leaders , but not the overall course of his polices . whether schröder will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda remains to be seen , however , as some social democratic mps may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party . reforms to timid for opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany is at a five-year high many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . but business leaders and the conservative opposition say schröder ’ s reforms don ’ t go far enough and have begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor . friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , even if it agreed with the general direction of the reforms .
“ he ’ ll have to get his own majority in parliament and then we ’ ll decide whether we vote for it or not , ” merz told reuters . the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
tuesday ’ s meeting was seen as an attempt to get organized labor on board , but in light of the withering attack from union leaders , the government was already playing down expectations . “ there is understanding that there can ’ t be agreement on all issues , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz .

" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .
the organizers of the world cup in germany have set aside € 300,000 -lrb- $ 326,900 -rrb- for ecological investment ; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister juergen trittin .
" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .
organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament .
plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food and drink refuse is a problem being tackled by " green goal " .
refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event .
with visitors to the 2006 world cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands , the " green goal " operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority .
as a result , spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates .
this will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on june 9 , 2006 .
the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .
enbw ag , one of three 2006 fifa world cup official energy suppliers , will supply electricity derived from renewable sources .
tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .
in an attempt to address the most demanding goal of reducing negative effects on the global climate , these emissions will be balanced by investment in environmental protection in other areas . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work begins on munich 's new football stadium construction has begun on munich 's new state-of-the-art football stadium , the allianz arena , in readiness for the 2006 world cup .

forget viagra : german scientists are claiming that a daily bratwurst is enough to improve potency in middle-aged males by over 60 percent . ageing lotharios and sexually-frustrated wives and girlfriends are breathing a sigh of relief today , with the news that a daily german sausage can increase male potency by up to 63 percent . german scientists at the bad kissingen institute for sexual behaviour say that the effect on the male libido is virtually the same as taking viagra . in clinical tests carried out over five years , the researchers found that eating a daily bratwurst increased potency and sex drive in males over 50 by over 63 percent in most cases .
the secret , so the scientists say , lies in the distinct mixture of herbs and spices in the german national dish and has an extraordinary effect on male sexual behaviour if eaten over a long period .
bratwurst is a traditional german pork and veal sausage , seasoned with a secret mix of herbs and spices including ginger , marjoram , caraway and coriander .
putting a tiger back in their tank over 1,000 males over 50 from all over the country underwent the field trials , which saw them chomping on a different type of german sausage every week . one of the volunteers , reinhard schmidt , -lrb- 52 -rrb- spent five years being force-fed the german national dish by his wife in a bid to revive their flagging sex life . " at first , i was unsure , as i 'm not really a big fan of sausages , but my wife convinced me that it might put a tiger back in my tank !
i did n't like the idea of medicines and this seemed like a natural alternative , " schmidt said , admitting that life between the sheets was now the " best it had ever been " in their 30- year marriage . another , thomas schmatzer -lrb- 60 -rrb- , was also over the moon .
" my girlfriend is a bit younger than me and i was getting slightly concerned about , well , you know what , " he admitted shyly .
" but this bratwurst trick has got me feeling like a spring chicken again . "
schmatzer said his girlfriend stocked up on sausages three times a week to make sure they would now never run out of the natural love drug . but the researchers cautioned that the effects did vary according to the male 's natural sex drive .
" we 're not saying this a miracle cure , but it definitely does , er , boost things .
it certainly seems like a good old sausage is the answer that many men of a certain age have been looking for , " matthius raubtier , the scientist leading the trials , said . the head of the german sausage makers association -lrb- vwh -rrb- , gunther riecken , said : " this is great news for sausage makers all over germany .

forget viagra : german scientists are claiming that a daily bratwurst is enough to improve potency in middle-aged males by over 60 percent . ageing lotharios and sexually-frustrated wives and girlfriends are breathing a sigh of relief today , with the news that a daily german sausage can increase male potency by up to 63 percent . german scientists at the bad kissingen institute for sexual behaviour say that the effect on the male libido is virtually the same as taking viagra . in clinical tests carried out over five years , the researchers found that eating a daily bratwurst increased potency and sex drive in males over 50 by over 63 percent in most cases .
the secret , so the scientists say , lies in the distinct mixture of herbs and spices in the german national dish and has an extraordinary effect on male sexual behaviour if eaten over a long period .
bratwurst is a traditional german pork and veal sausage , seasoned with a secret mix of herbs and spices including ginger , marjoram , caraway and coriander .
putting a tiger back in their tank over 1,000 males over 50 from all over the country underwent the field trials , which saw them chomping on a different type of german sausage every week . one of the volunteers , reinhard schmidt , -lrb- 52 -rrb- spent five years being force-fed the german national dish by his wife in a bid to revive their flagging sex life . " at first , i was unsure , as i 'm not really a big fan of sausages , but my wife convinced me that it might put a tiger back in my tank !
i did n't like the idea of medicines and this seemed like a natural alternative , " schmidt said , admitting that life between the sheets was now the " best it had ever been " in their 30- year marriage . another , thomas schmatzer -lrb- 60 -rrb- , was also over the moon .
" my girlfriend is a bit younger than me and i was getting slightly concerned about , well , you know what , " he admitted shyly .
" but this bratwurst trick has got me feeling like a spring chicken again . "
schmatzer said his girlfriend stocked up on sausages three times a week to make sure they would now never run out of the natural love drug . but the researchers cautioned that the effects did vary according to the male 's natural sex drive .
" we 're not saying this a miracle cure , but it definitely does , er , boost things .
it certainly seems like a good old sausage is the answer that many men of a certain age have been looking for , " matthius raubtier , the scientist leading the trials , said . the head of the german sausage makers association -lrb- vwh -rrb- , gunther riecken , said : " this is great news for sausage makers all over germany .

several top german trade union leaders on tuesday attacked the government ’ s proposed plans to trim the welfare state and boost the economy only hours ahead of a meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder . “ it ’ s going in the wrong direction , ” klaus wiesehügel , head of mining union ig bau , told zdf television , referring to german chancellor schröder ’ s proposed cuts in unemployment benefits and loosening of job protection . schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . “ the social cuts in their current form would plunge vast numbers of the unemployed into a financial emergency , ” said ursula engelen-kefer , the deputy leader of the german trade union federation .
she called for nationwide union protests against the reforms . economy stalls but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . “ i expect agenda 2010 to be implemented point for point , ” schröder said at a press conference on monday .
he said he was willing to discuss details with the union leaders , but not the overall course of his polices . whether schröder will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda remains to be seen , however , as some social democratic mps may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party . reforms to timid for opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany is at a five-year high many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . but business leaders and the conservative opposition say schröder ’ s reforms don ’ t go far enough and have begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor . friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , even if it agreed with the general direction of the reforms .
“ he ’ ll have to get his own majority in parliament and then we ’ ll decide whether we vote for it or not , ” merz told reuters . the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
tuesday ’ s meeting was seen as an attempt to get organized labor on board , but in light of the withering attack from union leaders , the government was already playing down expectations . “ there is understanding that there can ’ t be agreement on all issues , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz .

" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .
the organizers of the world cup in germany have set aside € 300,000 -lrb- $ 326,900 -rrb- for ecological investment ; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation .

" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .
organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament .
plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food and drink refuse is a problem being tackled by " green goal " .
refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event .
with visitors to the 2006 world cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands , the " green goal " operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority .
as a result , spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates .
this will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on june 9 , 2006 .
the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .
enbw ag , one of three 2006 fifa world cup official energy suppliers , will supply electricity derived from renewable sources .
tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .

forget viagra : german scientists are claiming that a daily bratwurst is enough to improve potency in middle-aged males by over 60 percent . ageing lotharios and sexually-frustrated wives and girlfriends are breathing a sigh of relief today , with the news that a daily german sausage can increase male potency by up to 63 percent . german scientists at the bad kissingen institute for sexual behaviour say that the effect on the male libido is virtually the same as taking viagra . in clinical tests carried out over five years , the researchers found that eating a daily bratwurst increased potency and sex drive in males over 50 by over 63 percent in most cases .
the secret , so the scientists say , lies in the distinct mixture of herbs and spices in the german national dish and has an extraordinary effect on male sexual behaviour if eaten over a long period .
bratwurst is a traditional german pork and veal sausage , seasoned with a secret mix of herbs and spices including ginger , marjoram , caraway and coriander .
putting a tiger back in their tank over 1,000 males over 50 from all over the country underwent the field trials , which saw them chomping on a different type of german sausage every week . one of the volunteers , reinhard schmidt , -lrb- 52 -rrb- spent five years being force-fed the german national dish by his wife in a bid to revive their flagging sex life . " at first , i was unsure , as i 'm not really a big fan of sausages , but my wife convinced me that it might put a tiger back in my tank !
i did n't like the idea of medicines and this seemed like a natural alternative , " schmidt said , admitting that life between the sheets was now the " best it had ever been " in their 30- year marriage . another , thomas schmatzer -lrb- 60 -rrb- , was also over the moon .
" my girlfriend is a bit younger than me and i was getting slightly concerned about , well , you know what , " he admitted shyly .
" but this bratwurst trick has got me feeling like a spring chicken again . "
schmatzer said his girlfriend stocked up on sausages three times a week to make sure they would now never run out of the natural love drug . but the researchers cautioned that the effects did vary according to the male 's natural sex drive .
" we 're not saying this a miracle cure , but it definitely does , er , boost things .
it certainly seems like a good old sausage is the answer that many men of a certain age have been looking for , " matthius raubtier , the scientist leading the trials , said . the head of the german sausage makers association -lrb- vwh -rrb- , gunther riecken , said : " this is great news for sausage makers all over germany .

forget viagra : german scientists are claiming that a daily bratwurst is enough to improve potency in middle-aged males by over 60 percent . ageing lotharios and sexually-frustrated wives and girlfriends are breathing a sigh of relief today , with the news that a daily german sausage can increase male potency by up to 63 percent . german scientists at the bad kissingen institute for sexual behaviour say that the effect on the male libido is virtually the same as taking viagra . in clinical tests carried out over five years , the researchers found that eating a daily bratwurst increased potency and sex drive in males over 50 by over 63 percent in most cases .
the secret , so the scientists say , lies in the distinct mixture of herbs and spices in the german national dish and has an extraordinary effect on male sexual behaviour if eaten over a long period .
bratwurst is a traditional german pork and veal sausage , seasoned with a secret mix of herbs and spices including ginger , marjoram , caraway and coriander .

several top german trade union leaders on tuesday attacked the government ’ s proposed plans to trim the welfare state and boost the economy only hours ahead of a meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder . “ it ’ s going in the wrong direction , ” klaus wiesehügel , head of mining union ig bau , told zdf television , referring to german chancellor schröder ’ s proposed cuts in unemployment benefits and loosening of job protection . schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . “ the social cuts in their current form would plunge vast numbers of the unemployed into a financial emergency , ” said ursula engelen-kefer , the deputy leader of the german trade union federation .
she called for nationwide union protests against the reforms . economy stalls but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . “ i expect agenda 2010 to be implemented point for point , ” schröder said at a press conference on monday .
he said he was willing to discuss details with the union leaders , but not the overall course of his polices . whether schröder will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda remains to be seen , however , as some social democratic mps may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party . reforms to timid for opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany is at a five-year high many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . but business leaders and the conservative opposition say schröder ’ s reforms don ’ t go far enough and have begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor . friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , even if it agreed with the general direction of the reforms .
“ he ’ ll have to get his own majority in parliament and then we ’ ll decide whether we vote for it or not , ” merz told reuters . the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
tuesday ’ s meeting was seen as an attempt to get organized labor on board , but in light of the withering attack from union leaders , the government was already playing down expectations . “ there is understanding that there can ’ t be agreement on all issues , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz .

" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .
the organizers of the world cup in germany have set aside € 300,000 -lrb- $ 326,900 -rrb- for ecological investment ; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister juergen trittin .
" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .
organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament .
plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food and drink refuse is a problem being tackled by " green goal " .
refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event .
with visitors to the 2006 world cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands , the " green goal " operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority .
as a result , spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates .
this will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on june 9 , 2006 .
the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .
enbw ag , one of three 2006 fifa world cup official energy suppliers , will supply electricity derived from renewable sources .
tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .

at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . “ the social cuts in their current form would plunge vast numbers of the unemployed into a financial emergency , ” said ursula engelen-kefer , the deputy leader of the german trade union federation .

" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .
the organizers of the world cup in germany have set aside € 300,000 -lrb- $ 326,900 -rrb- for ecological investment ; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister juergen trittin .
" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .
organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament .
plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food and drink refuse is a problem being tackled by " green goal " .
refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event .
with visitors to the 2006 world cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands , the " green goal " operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority .
as a result , spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates .
this will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on june 9 , 2006 .
the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .
enbw ag , one of three 2006 fifa world cup official energy suppliers , will supply electricity derived from renewable sources .
tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .
in an attempt to address the most demanding goal of reducing negative effects on the global climate , these emissions will be balanced by investment in environmental protection in other areas . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work begins on munich 's new football stadium construction has begun on munich 's new state-of-the-art football stadium , the allianz arena , in readiness for the 2006 world cup .

forget viagra : german scientists are claiming that a daily bratwurst is enough to improve potency in middle-aged males by over 60 percent . ageing lotharios and sexually-frustrated wives and girlfriends are breathing a sigh of relief today , with the news that a daily german sausage can increase male potency by up to 63 percent . german scientists at the bad kissingen institute for sexual behaviour say that the effect on the male libido is virtually the same as taking viagra . in clinical tests carried out over five years , the researchers found that eating a daily bratwurst increased potency and sex drive in males over 50 by over 63 percent in most cases .
the secret , so the scientists say , lies in the distinct mixture of herbs and spices in the german national dish and has an extraordinary effect on male sexual behaviour if eaten over a long period .
bratwurst is a traditional german pork and veal sausage , seasoned with a secret mix of herbs and spices including ginger , marjoram , caraway and coriander .
putting a tiger back in their tank over 1,000 males over 50 from all over the country underwent the field trials , which saw them chomping on a different type of german sausage every week . one of the volunteers , reinhard schmidt , -lrb- 52 -rrb- spent five years being force-fed the german national dish by his wife in a bid to revive their flagging sex life . " at first , i was unsure , as i 'm not really a big fan of sausages , but my wife convinced me that it might put a tiger back in my tank !
i did n't like the idea of medicines and this seemed like a natural alternative , " schmidt said , admitting that life between the sheets was now the " best it had ever been " in their 30- year marriage . another , thomas schmatzer -lrb- 60 -rrb- , was also over the moon .
" my girlfriend is a bit younger than me and i was getting slightly concerned about , well , you know what , " he admitted shyly .
" but this bratwurst trick has got me feeling like a spring chicken again . "
schmatzer said his girlfriend stocked up on sausages three times a week to make sure they would now never run out of the natural love drug . but the researchers cautioned that the effects did vary according to the male 's natural sex drive .
" we 're not saying this a miracle cure , but it definitely does , er , boost things .
it certainly seems like a good old sausage is the answer that many men of a certain age have been looking for , " matthius raubtier , the scientist leading the trials , said . the head of the german sausage makers association -lrb- vwh -rrb- , gunther riecken , said : " this is great news for sausage makers all over germany .

forget viagra : german scientists are claiming that a daily bratwurst is enough to improve potency in middle-aged males by over 60 percent . ageing lotharios and sexually-frustrated wives and girlfriends are breathing a sigh of relief today , with the news that a daily german sausage can increase male potency by up to 63 percent . german scientists at the bad kissingen institute for sexual behaviour say that the effect on the male libido is virtually the same as taking viagra . in clinical tests carried out over five years , the researchers found that eating a daily bratwurst increased potency and sex drive in males over 50 by over 63 percent in most cases .
the secret , so the scientists say , lies in the distinct mixture of herbs and spices in the german national dish and has an extraordinary effect on male sexual behaviour if eaten over a long period .
bratwurst is a traditional german pork and veal sausage , seasoned with a secret mix of herbs and spices including ginger , marjoram , caraway and coriander .

several top german trade union leaders on tuesday attacked the government ’ s proposed plans to trim the welfare state and boost the economy only hours ahead of a meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder . “ it ’ s going in the wrong direction , ” klaus wiesehügel , head of mining union ig bau , told zdf television , referring to german chancellor schröder ’ s proposed cuts in unemployment benefits and loosening of job protection . schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . “ the social cuts in their current form would plunge vast numbers of the unemployed into a financial emergency , ” said ursula engelen-kefer , the deputy leader of the german trade union federation .
she called for nationwide union protests against the reforms . economy stalls but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . “ i expect agenda 2010 to be implemented point for point , ” schröder said at a press conference on monday .
he said he was willing to discuss details with the union leaders , but not the overall course of his polices . whether schröder will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda remains to be seen , however , as some social democratic mps may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party . reforms to timid for opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany is at a five-year high many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . but business leaders and the conservative opposition say schröder ’ s reforms don ’ t go far enough and have begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor . friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , even if it agreed with the general direction of the reforms .
“ he ’ ll have to get his own majority in parliament and then we ’ ll decide whether we vote for it or not , ” merz told reuters . the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
tuesday ’ s meeting was seen as an attempt to get organized labor on board , but in light of the withering attack from union leaders , the government was already playing down expectations . “ there is understanding that there can ’ t be agreement on all issues , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz .

several top german trade union leaders on tuesday attacked the government ’ s proposed plans to trim the welfare state and boost the economy only hours ahead of a meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder . “ it ’ s going in the wrong direction , ” klaus wiesehügel , head of mining union ig bau , told zdf television , referring to german chancellor schröder ’ s proposed cuts in unemployment benefits and loosening of job protection . schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . “ the social cuts in their current form would plunge vast numbers of the unemployed into a financial emergency , ” said ursula engelen-kefer , the deputy leader of the german trade union federation .
she called for nationwide union protests against the reforms . economy stalls but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . “ i expect agenda 2010 to be implemented point for point , ” schröder said at a press conference on monday .
he said he was willing to discuss details with the union leaders , but not the overall course of his polices . whether schröder will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda remains to be seen , however , as some social democratic mps may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party . reforms to timid for opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany is at a five-year high many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . but business leaders and the conservative opposition say schröder ’ s reforms don ’ t go far enough and have begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor . friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , even if it agreed with the general direction of the reforms .

" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .
the organizers of the world cup in germany have set aside € 300,000 -lrb- $ 326,900 -rrb- for ecological investment ; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister juergen trittin .
" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .
organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament .
plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food and drink refuse is a problem being tackled by " green goal " .
refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event .
with visitors to the 2006 world cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands , the " green goal " operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority .
as a result , spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates .
this will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on june 9 , 2006 .
the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .
enbw ag , one of three 2006 fifa world cup official energy suppliers , will supply electricity derived from renewable sources .
tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .

" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .
the organizers of the world cup in germany have set aside € 300,000 -lrb- $ 326,900 -rrb- for ecological investment ; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister juergen trittin .
" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .
organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament .
plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food and drink refuse is a problem being tackled by " green goal " .
refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event .
with visitors to the 2006 world cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands , the " green goal " operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority .
as a result , spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates .
this will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on june 9 , 2006 .
the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .
enbw ag , one of three 2006 fifa world cup official energy suppliers , will supply electricity derived from renewable sources .
tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .

" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .
the organizers of the world cup in germany have set aside € 300,000 -lrb- $ 326,900 -rrb- for ecological investment ; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister juergen trittin .
" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .
organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament .
plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food and drink refuse is a problem being tackled by " green goal " .
refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event .
with visitors to the 2006 world cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands , the " green goal " operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority .
as a result , spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates .
this will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on june 9 , 2006 .
the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .
enbw ag , one of three 2006 fifa world cup official energy suppliers , will supply electricity derived from renewable sources .
tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .

several top german trade union leaders on tuesday attacked the government ’ s proposed plans to trim the welfare state and boost the economy only hours ahead of a meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder . “ it ’ s going in the wrong direction , ” klaus wiesehügel , head of mining union ig bau , told zdf television , referring to german chancellor schröder ’ s proposed cuts in unemployment benefits and loosening of job protection . schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . “ the social cuts in their current form would plunge vast numbers of the unemployed into a financial emergency , ” said ursula engelen-kefer , the deputy leader of the german trade union federation .
she called for nationwide union protests against the reforms . economy stalls but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . “ i expect agenda 2010 to be implemented point for point , ” schröder said at a press conference on monday .
he said he was willing to discuss details with the union leaders , but not the overall course of his polices . whether schröder will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda remains to be seen , however , as some social democratic mps may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party . reforms to timid for opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany is at a five-year high many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . but business leaders and the conservative opposition say schröder ’ s reforms don ’ t go far enough and have begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor . friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , even if it agreed with the general direction of the reforms .
“ he ’ ll have to get his own majority in parliament and then we ’ ll decide whether we vote for it or not , ” merz told reuters . the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
tuesday ’ s meeting was seen as an attempt to get organized labor on board , but in light of the withering attack from union leaders , the government was already playing down expectations . “ there is understanding that there can ’ t be agreement on all issues , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz .
but he said the unions could be certain that the proposals would be socially balanced . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces internal opposition to reforms schröder calls for germans to prepare for sacrifices tackling the reform problems of germany 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

several top german trade union leaders on tuesday attacked the government ’ s proposed plans to trim the welfare state and boost the economy only hours ahead of a meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder . “ it ’ s going in the wrong direction , ” klaus wiesehügel , head of mining union ig bau , told zdf television , referring to german chancellor schröder ’ s proposed cuts in unemployment benefits and loosening of job protection . schröder last month announced a package of sweeping reforms in an attempt to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system , but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . “ the social cuts in their current form would plunge vast numbers of the unemployed into a financial emergency , ” said ursula engelen-kefer , the deputy leader of the german trade union federation .
she called for nationwide union protests against the reforms . economy stalls but schröder has staked his political survival on pushing through the unpopular measures , after scraping to victory in last september ’ s general election .
in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . “ i expect agenda 2010 to be implemented point for point , ” schröder said at a press conference on monday .
he said he was willing to discuss details with the union leaders , but not the overall course of his polices . whether schröder will be able to press ahead with his reform agenda remains to be seen , however , as some social democratic mps may be loath to take on the unions , a traditional constituency of the party . reforms to timid for opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment in germany is at a five-year high many of the chancellor ’ s own backbenchers argue relaxing job protection rules won ’ t create new jobs and are instead calling on the government to spend more on public works projects to spur the economy . but business leaders and the conservative opposition say schröder ’ s reforms don ’ t go far enough and have begun championing proposals to rein in the unions ' power to set nationwide pay contracts - a taboo for organized labor . friedrich merz , the economics spokesman of the opposition christian democrats , said the government could not count on the opposition to pass its legislation , even if it agreed with the general direction of the reforms .
“ he ’ ll have to get his own majority in parliament and then we ’ ll decide whether we vote for it or not , ” merz told reuters . the final shape of the proposals are to be hammered out by the end of april and the chancellor has said he will push to have the reforms made into law before the parliament ’ s break this summer .
tuesday ’ s meeting was seen as an attempt to get organized labor on board , but in light of the withering attack from union leaders , the government was already playing down expectations . “ there is understanding that there can ’ t be agreement on all issues , ” said spd general secretary olaf scholz .

forget viagra : german scientists are claiming that a daily bratwurst is enough to improve potency in middle-aged males by over 60 percent . ageing lotharios and sexually-frustrated wives and girlfriends are breathing a sigh of relief today , with the news that a daily german sausage can increase male potency by up to 63 percent . german scientists at the bad kissingen institute for sexual behaviour say that the effect on the male libido is virtually the same as taking viagra . in clinical tests carried out over five years , the researchers found that eating a daily bratwurst increased potency and sex drive in males over 50 by over 63 percent in most cases .
the secret , so the scientists say , lies in the distinct mixture of herbs and spices in the german national dish and has an extraordinary effect on male sexual behaviour if eaten over a long period .
bratwurst is a traditional german pork and veal sausage , seasoned with a secret mix of herbs and spices including ginger , marjoram , caraway and coriander .
putting a tiger back in their tank over 1,000 males over 50 from all over the country underwent the field trials , which saw them chomping on a different type of german sausage every week . one of the volunteers , reinhard schmidt , -lrb- 52 -rrb- spent five years being force-fed the german national dish by his wife in a bid to revive their flagging sex life . " at first , i was unsure , as i 'm not really a big fan of sausages , but my wife convinced me that it might put a tiger back in my tank !
i did n't like the idea of medicines and this seemed like a natural alternative , " schmidt said , admitting that life between the sheets was now the " best it had ever been " in their 30- year marriage . another , thomas schmatzer -lrb- 60 -rrb- , was also over the moon .
" my girlfriend is a bit younger than me and i was getting slightly concerned about , well , you know what , " he admitted shyly .
" but this bratwurst trick has got me feeling like a spring chicken again . "
schmatzer said his girlfriend stocked up on sausages three times a week to make sure they would now never run out of the natural love drug . but the researchers cautioned that the effects did vary according to the male 's natural sex drive .
" we 're not saying this a miracle cure , but it definitely does , er , boost things .
it certainly seems like a good old sausage is the answer that many men of a certain age have been looking for , " matthius raubtier , the scientist leading the trials , said . the head of the german sausage makers association -lrb- vwh -rrb- , gunther riecken , said : " this is great news for sausage makers all over germany .

i did n't like the idea of medicines and this seemed like a natural alternative , " schmidt said , admitting that life between the sheets was now the " best it had ever been " in their 30- year marriage . another , thomas schmatzer -lrb- 60 -rrb- , was also over the moon .
" my girlfriend is a bit younger than me and i was getting slightly concerned about , well , you know what , " he admitted shyly .
" but this bratwurst trick has got me feeling like a spring chicken again . "
schmatzer said his girlfriend stocked up on sausages three times a week to make sure they would now never run out of the natural love drug . but the researchers cautioned that the effects did vary according to the male 's natural sex drive .
" we 're not saying this a miracle cure , but it definitely does , er , boost things .
it certainly seems like a good old sausage is the answer that many men of a certain age have been looking for , " matthius raubtier , the scientist leading the trials , said . the head of the german sausage makers association -lrb- vwh -rrb- , gunther riecken , said : " this is great news for sausage makers all over germany .

" the whole world will be watching germany during the world cup , so we also want to be a role model for the environment , " said beckenbauer , adding the effort will promote environmental management in four key areas : water , refuse , energy and transportation . " green goal - the path to a sustainable 2006 fifa world cup " will be backed by the german government , soccer 's world governing body fifa and members of the german business community .
the organizers of the world cup in germany have set aside € 300,000 -lrb- $ 326,900 -rrb- for ecological investment ; a figure matched by a government sponsored environmental foundation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister juergen trittin .
" i congratulate the organizing committee on its decision to meet a wide range of environmental concerns with its ' green goal ' initiative , ” said trittin .
“ this is an example of teamwork and tactics at its best .
we will set new standards in the environmental sphere via a series of concrete measures . "
water demand will be immense resources will be under pressure to deal with demands for drinking water , utilities and irrigation , as fans from the 32 participating countries flock to germany for the month-long competition .
the stadiums used for matches will require alone approximately 42,000 cubic meters of water .
concrete measures designed to deal with this demand include increasing the proportion of water reserves derived from rain .
organizers intend for ecological sources to provide 20 percent of total water used at the tournament .
plans are also in place concerning the regular maintenance of appliances and pipe work to make the water delivery system more efficient .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : food and drink refuse is a problem being tackled by " green goal " .
refuse from food and drink sales is a problem for any major event .
with visitors to the 2006 world cup expected to number in the hundreds of thousands , the " green goal " operation considers the potential trash problem as top priority .
as a result , spectators can expect to use reusable cups and china or plastic dishes rather than throwaway paper plates .
this will be strongly enforced at every stadium involved in the tournament scheduled to begin on june 9 , 2006 .
the " green goal " initiative also hopes to reduce the current energy consumption at the stadiums by 20 percent during the tournament by exploiting energy-saving potential .
enbw ag , one of three 2006 fifa world cup official energy suppliers , will supply electricity derived from renewable sources .
tougher targets in a statement , germany 's environment ministry stressed the importance of setting specified targets for water and energy use : " these are more stringent than usual because , unlike the olympic games , the event will be spread across 12 cities in germany and will generally have to rely on stadiums which already exist . "
in a bid to cut down on the effects of pollution from the exhaust fumes of cars and private vehicles making their way to the venues , the organizers are pushing an efficient and regular public transport network in the cities hosting games throughout the tournament .
the target is that at least half of all visitors should arrive at the matches via public transport , compared with a current average of 40 percent for german first division soccer games .
despite the controls outlined by organizers , the 2006 world cup is still likely to generate an estimated 100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in germany .
in an attempt to address the most demanding goal of reducing negative effects on the global climate , these emissions will be balanced by investment in environmental protection in other areas . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de work begins on munich 's new football stadium construction has begun on munich 's new state-of-the-art football stadium , the allianz arena , in readiness for the 2006 world cup .

details including race , names , addresses and why people were stopped will be taken in hackney , east london , merseyside , nottinghamshire , sussex , west yorkshire , north wales and the west midlands .
copies of the receipt will be given to those stopped and the records will be used to see whether police are stopping a disproportionate number of black and asian people .
it is hoped the six-month trial , which begins on tuesday , will make police more accountable .
the idea was first suggested in recommendation 61 of the independent report into the inquiry covering the racist murder of black teenager stephen lawrence .
currently records are only kept of people who are stopped and searched .
official definition of police stop " when an officer requests a person in a public place to account for themselves - their actions , behaviour , presence in an area or possession of anything " figures published last november showed that black people were eight times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people , and asians were three times more likely .
home office ministers hope making a record of those who are stopped will increase public confidence in the police .
but some fear the trial scheme will mean more paperwork and people will resent being asked for their personal details .

details including race , names , addresses and why people were stopped will be taken in hackney , east london , merseyside , nottinghamshire , sussex , west yorkshire , north wales and the west midlands .
copies of the receipt will be given to those stopped and the records will be used to see whether police are stopping a disproportionate number of black and asian people .
it is hoped the six-month trial , which begins on tuesday , will make police more accountable .
the idea was first suggested in recommendation 61 of the independent report into the inquiry covering the racist murder of black teenager stephen lawrence .
currently records are only kept of people who are stopped and searched .
official definition of police stop " when an officer requests a person in a public place to account for themselves - their actions , behaviour , presence in an area or possession of anything " figures published last november showed that black people were eight times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people , and asians were three times more likely .
home office ministers hope making a record of those who are stopped will increase public confidence in the police .
but some fear the trial scheme will mean more paperwork and people will resent being asked for their personal details .
glen smyth of the metropolitan police federation said : " what it aims to achieve is laudable but i fear it will actually worsen relations with the community . "
he added : " it 's bureaucracy for bureaucracy 's sake and it will undoubtedly increase their overall paperwork levels . "
a scotland yard spokesman said the home office was looking at how best to streamline the procedure and they will be monitoring the amount of paperwork generated during the six-month trial .
recommendation 61 could be in force across london by september 2004 .
