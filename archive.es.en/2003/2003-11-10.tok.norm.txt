gerhard schröder was awarded a lowly position at 82 , way behind such german luminaries as music producer dieter bohlen -lrb- 30 -rrb- , formula one star michael schumacher -lrb- 26 -rrb- and talent show runner-up daniel küblböck -lrb- 16 -rrb- .
schröder was even overtaken by wolfgang amadeus mozart -lrb- 20 -rrb- , not even a german in the strictest sense , as he is claimed by austria as a native son .
the poll , organized by the bild newspaper and zdf television , took calls from millions of germans to find their top 100 compatriots from a nomination list of 1300 .
the top ten , which includes karl marx , albert einstein , willy brandt and johann sebastian bach , will be the subject of a further poll over the next three weeks to find the “ best german . ” more briefs 10.11.2003 -pipe- sacked commander strikes back 06.11.2003 -pipe- germany warns new eu states over funds 06.11.2003 -pipe- iraqi soccer coach blasts u.s. administrator 06.11.2003 -pipe- struck on offensive to calm anti-semitic army fears 06.11.2003 -pipe- german unemployment dips in october 05.11.2003 -pipe- end to german nuclear power nearer 05.11.2003 -pipe- court rules home schooling unacceptable 05.11.2003 -pipe- students , civil servants demonstrate against government plans radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the demand is modest compared to past years - in the last pay round the union entered talks requesting 6.5 percent - and represents unions ' weakened position and a toning down of their stridency in the face of a sluggish growth .
announcing the number in frankfurt , ig metall head jürgen peters said the union would seek a contract lasting 12 months from january .
he also said the four percent demand reflected expectations that europe 's biggest economy is on the road to recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.11.2003 eu postpones decision on allowing gm foods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm crops have been the subject of many a demonstration in europe .
after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .
genetically modified foods are popularly referred to as “ franken food ” and consumers say they are extremely wary about buying food products whose genes have been spliced in laboratories .
retailers say they see no reason to offer more gm foods for sale until demand rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers , even those not specifically opposed to biotech crops , are also reluctant to go the biotech route , since sowing land with gm seeds is an economic gamble few are willing to take in the current environment .
others do not trust the science .
“ i ’ m afraid we simply don ’ t have enough information to make the right decision .
i ’ m also concerned that the tests we have so far are not conclusive enough to judge the long-term consequences , ” said carsten fedder , a farmer who chooses to grow a conventional rapeseed crops , even though several gm varieties have built-in insecticides .
proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .
they point to the many advantages modern genetic technology can provide , such as maize varieties which flourish even in the midst of drought or picture-perfect tomatoes that are extremely high in vitamin content .
scientists are even exploring creating foods that contain agents that are helpful in preventing diseases like uterine cancer .
“ we ’ ve basically shown that a potato can produce a vaccine , ” said sophie biemelt , a researcher the institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in gatersleben .
“ one could imagine one day getting vaccines from the food you eat . ”
but such arguments have thus far failed to sway a majority of europeans .
farmer carsten fedder said he prefers the genetics that nature gave his potatoes , or the rye that he also grows .
if he chose to grow the generically modified version of the grain , he would have higher yields , such as american farmers enjoy . still , fedder , whose children influence his views , insists he is not concerned .

after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .
genetically modified foods are popularly referred to as “ franken food ” and consumers say they are extremely wary about buying food products whose genes have been spliced in laboratories .
retailers say they see no reason to offer more gm foods for sale until demand rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers , even those not specifically opposed to biotech crops , are also reluctant to go the biotech route , since sowing land with gm seeds is an economic gamble few are willing to take in the current environment .
others do not trust the science .
“ i ’ m afraid we simply don ’ t have enough information to make the right decision .
i ’ m also concerned that the tests we have so far are not conclusive enough to judge the long-term consequences , ” said carsten fedder , a farmer who chooses to grow a conventional rapeseed crops , even though several gm varieties have built-in insecticides .
proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .
they point to the many advantages modern genetic technology can provide , such as maize varieties which flourish even in the midst of drought or picture-perfect tomatoes that are extremely high in vitamin content .
scientists are even exploring creating foods that contain agents that are helpful in preventing diseases like uterine cancer .
“ we ’ ve basically shown that a potato can produce a vaccine , ” said sophie biemelt , a researcher the institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in gatersleben .
“ one could imagine one day getting vaccines from the food you eat . ”
but such arguments have thus far failed to sway a majority of europeans .
farmer carsten fedder said he prefers the genetics that nature gave his potatoes , or the rye that he also grows .
if he chose to grow the generically modified version of the grain , he would have higher yields , such as american farmers enjoy . still , fedder , whose children influence his views , insists he is not concerned .
“ the market here in europe is large enough , really .

" we expect an explanation without any holes for the embarrassing and inexcusable events , " said manfred von richthofen , president of the german sports federation .
time running out after latest resignation the ultimatum comes just days after the joint bid suffered another major blow .
burkhard jung , the city official who represented leipzig during the city ’ s successful bid to become the german candidate in april before becoming a supervisory board member of the company overseeing leipzig ’ s bid , stepped down from his position on friday after allegations of financial irregularities surfaced .
reports say that state prosecutors are investigating jung ’ s role in illegal commission payments worth € 150,000 -lrb- $ 171,400 -rrb- made to a marketing company while leipzig was bidding to represent germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig 's bid could go up in flames .
the nok held a general meeting in leipzig on saturday , the day after jung resigned , and issued a statement that offered support for the bid but implied leipzig officials were operating on borrowed time to get the bid back on track .
an olympic committee spokesman told deutsche welle that should leipzig fail , there would be no other german candidate . " the members were sorry to hear of a number of turbulent incidents that have damaged the internal structure of the leipzig bid , " the nok statement said .
" they expect an immediate correction of that situation in order to put all available strength behind the bid , " the statement added . leipzig in intensive care " german sport has renewed its commitment to bring the games to germany , " said nok president klaus steinbach .
" but we are not naive , " he added .
" we know that the patient has not healed and still needs intensive care . " in fact , the leipzig / rostock bid appears to be on life support , fighting for its existence while the nok watches solemnly , ready to flick off the switch if its condition deteriorates further . in terms of the competition for the 2012 games , leipzig / rostock was always the weakest child , rejoicing hopefully in the company of stronger players , happy to be involved . the stronger candidates - london , madrid , new york and paris in particular - paid leipzig / rostock little mind , more concerned with each other than the chances of the upstart .
it should have been the ideal cover for a surprising bid from under the noses of the favorites . but body blows from within have knocked the stuffing out of the olympic whelp . stasi rumors and financial slurs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk thärichen .
first were the allegations surrounding dirk thärichen -lrb- picture -rrb- , the head of leipzig 's olympic bid committee , concerning his past involvement with the stasi , the former east german secret police .
harald lochotzke , the chairman of rostock 's publicly-run olympic marketing committee , resigned soon after , dogged by similar stasi speculation and allegations of complicity in a number of financial irregularities . next to stand down was wolfram köhler .
the state secretary for saxony resigned after he had come under fire for allegedly paying his wife high commissions for helping to find financial sponsors while he was the mayor of the town of riesa .
köhler is considered to be the source of the idea to bring the games to leipzig and rostock . leipzig mayor wolfgang tiefensee has stressed that the recent controversy should not detract from the work being done to secure the games .
" as before we 're working with the greatest intensity and the greatest professionalism on this bid , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor under pressure : wolfgang tiefensee .
however , the pressure is on for tiefensee and his fellow leipzig supporters to root out the causes of any further possible scandal before it breaks into the public domain .
tiefensee will also be hoping that nothing happens between now and november 19 , the next meeting of the leipzig 2012 supervisory board . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stasi allegations dog leipzig olympic bid the stasi scandal which has threatened leipzig ’ s olympic bid has not abated despite the resignation of two leading members of the german committee .

princess caroline of monaco has taken her fight against german tabloids to the european court for human rights in strasbourg .
she 's asking for europe-wide regulations on the paparazzi . germany 's claim to monaco royality , princess caroline , has taken a decade-long privacy dispute with the german tabloids to the european court typically charged with handling major human rights issues .
the wife of ernst august prince of hannover first filed suit against several german tabloids in 1993 , after they published paparazzi photos of her riding , shopping and sunbathing were published in several german celebrity magazines .
after germany 's consitutional court sidestepped the case in 1999 , caroline 's lawyers took it to european court for human rights , arguing that the photos are a violation of article 8 of the european human rights convention , which give her the right to protection of her private and family life .
caroline 's lawyer matthias prinz said his client wants europe-wide regulations such as those in france , where prominent people may only be photographed while carrying out public duties , unless otherwise agreed on .
prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .
but in germany , he said , the interests of the tabloid press seem to take priority .
robert schweizer , a board member of the burda verlag , which publishes several german celebrity magazines , said the hearing in strasbourg is not about the rights of the publishers , but rather the rights of millions of readers .
for them , caroline of monaco is a " role model , " he said , which is why they have a justifiable interest in information about her life .
public interest in germany about caroline 's life increased with her marriage to prince ernst august of hannover .
german press under fire the german tabloid press has been under seige as of late .
sweden 's queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf have hired prinz to prepare a lawsuit against several publications for printing what they allege are made-up stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline von monaco " we want to a legal answer to the question of whether these publications can simply write what they want , " said a royal spokeswoman .
prinz said there are at least 40 questionable reports about the swedish royals in the last 14 weeks alone , including reports that crown princess victoria had an abortion , and that silvia and carl gustaf were contemplating divorce .
they have the support of norway ’ s monarchs , who have publicly criticised the german press for making up stories about crown prince haakon , his wife , princess mette-marit , as well as other members of the norwegian royal family . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do celebrities have the right to control which photos of themselves appear in the press ? radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

she 's asking for europe-wide regulations on the paparazzi . germany 's claim to monaco royality , princess caroline , has taken a decade-long privacy dispute with the german tabloids to the european court typically charged with handling major human rights issues .
the wife of ernst august prince of hannover first filed suit against several german tabloids in 1993 , after they published paparazzi photos of her riding , shopping and sunbathing were published in several german celebrity magazines .
after germany 's consitutional court sidestepped the case in 1999 , caroline 's lawyers took it to european court for human rights , arguing that the photos are a violation of article 8 of the european human rights convention , which give her the right to protection of her private and family life .
caroline 's lawyer matthias prinz said his client wants europe-wide regulations such as those in france , where prominent people may only be photographed while carrying out public duties , unless otherwise agreed on .
prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .
but in germany , he said , the interests of the tabloid press seem to take priority .
robert schweizer , a board member of the burda verlag , which publishes several german celebrity magazines , said the hearing in strasbourg is not about the rights of the publishers , but rather the rights of millions of readers .
for them , caroline of monaco is a " role model , " he said , which is why they have a justifiable interest in information about her life .
public interest in germany about caroline 's life increased with her marriage to prince ernst august of hannover .
german press under fire the german tabloid press has been under seige as of late .
sweden 's queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf have hired prinz to prepare a lawsuit against several publications for printing what they allege are made-up stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline von monaco " we want to a legal answer to the question of whether these publications can simply write what they want , " said a royal spokeswoman .
prinz said there are at least 40 questionable reports about the swedish royals in the last 14 weeks alone , including reports that crown princess victoria had an abortion , and that silvia and carl gustaf were contemplating divorce .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.11.2003 cdu fears party rift over anti-semitism scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will martin hohmann split the cdu ?
christian democratic leaders are standing behind a member of parliament who called jews a " race of perpetrators " despite mounting criticism that they have failed to take adequate disciplinary measures . martin hohmann has been reprimanded by party leadership , he 's been ordered to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee in the german parliament and instead has been moved to the environmental committee .
he 's also been given an ultimatum by his party : cease with the anti-semitic remarks or face expulsion . but that 's about as far as party leadership is willing to go at the moment - out of fear that excluding him could create a huge rift within the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , germany 's leading opposition party . in the members ' forum on the party 's web site , postings include comments critical of the cdu 's failure to expel hohmann .
but there are also those who say that hohmann 's remarks , made in a speech in early october , were taken out of context and that the parliamentarian simply expressed the thoughts of many germans .
an army general who had voiced similar feelings about hohmann 's viewpoints was fired from his job last week . party defends decision to keep hohmann for more than a week now , the cdu 's leadership has been struggling to decide how best to deal with the parliamentarian .
soon after hohmann 's comments became public , party leader angela merkel apparently consider banishing him from the cdu 's parliamentary group , according to the newsmagazine der spiegel . but other party leaders warned merkel that hohmann could no longer be controlled after that .
while condemning hohmann 's remarks , the cdu leadership appears to want to deal with any reprimand of hohmann internally . " we have taken a clear and necessary step but we also consider it to be sufficient , " laurenz meyer , the party 's secretary general , said in a television talk show on sunday , referring to reprimanding hohmann and moving him over to the environmental beat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party leader angela merkel , left , and cdu secretay general laurenz meyer have decided to keep hohmann within the party for the time being .
hohmann 's comments were " unspeakable " and " intolerable , " meyer said .
but , he added , hohmann was definitely not a anti-semite " in the narrow sense " but rather a " fundamentalist in his views on the church . "
besides , expelling hohmann from the party could take years . roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the central german state of hesse , where hohmann is from , defended the party 's decision not to expel the parliamentarian while taking steps to distance himself from hohmann 's anti-semitic remarks .
koch did so during a speech at a frankfurt synagogue , causing more than a quarter of the audience to leave the room . bavarian permier edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , said hohmann 's actions would be closely observed from now on .
" he 's on the strictest kind of probation , " stoiber said .
" one more remark like that and it will be impossible for him to remain within the party . " growing calls to expel hohmann others have instead called upon the cdu to get rid of hohmann .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.11.2003 eu postpones decision on allowing gm foods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm crops have been the subject of many a demonstration in europe .
after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .
genetically modified foods are popularly referred to as “ franken food ” and consumers say they are extremely wary about buying food products whose genes have been spliced in laboratories .
retailers say they see no reason to offer more gm foods for sale until demand rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers , even those not specifically opposed to biotech crops , are also reluctant to go the biotech route , since sowing land with gm seeds is an economic gamble few are willing to take in the current environment .
others do not trust the science .
“ i ’ m afraid we simply don ’ t have enough information to make the right decision .
i ’ m also concerned that the tests we have so far are not conclusive enough to judge the long-term consequences , ” said carsten fedder , a farmer who chooses to grow a conventional rapeseed crops , even though several gm varieties have built-in insecticides .
proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .
they point to the many advantages modern genetic technology can provide , such as maize varieties which flourish even in the midst of drought or picture-perfect tomatoes that are extremely high in vitamin content .
scientists are even exploring creating foods that contain agents that are helpful in preventing diseases like uterine cancer .
“ we ’ ve basically shown that a potato can produce a vaccine , ” said sophie biemelt , a researcher the institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in gatersleben .
“ one could imagine one day getting vaccines from the food you eat . ”
but such arguments have thus far failed to sway a majority of europeans .
farmer carsten fedder said he prefers the genetics that nature gave his potatoes , or the rye that he also grows .
if he chose to grow the generically modified version of the grain , he would have higher yields , such as american farmers enjoy . still , fedder , whose children influence his views , insists he is not concerned .
“ the market here in europe is large enough , really .
as long as it ’ s protected against genetically modified seeds , our opportunities are good , ” he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no franken food for europe british scientists have published a report indicating that gm crops may damage the environment .
biotech opponents said this confirmed their worst fears , while lobbyists stressed the positive side of such crops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.11.2003 nazi chemical giant declares bankruptcy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners lined up for a hard labor assignment at auschwitz in poland during world war ii the infamous nazi poison-gas manufacturer ig farben is insolvent , possibly leaving thousands of former forced laborers trying to claim compensation out in the cold . the timing was ironic .
on sunday , germany mourned the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
on monday , i.g. farben , which manufactured the gas that killed nazi concentration camp prisoners , was declared insolvent , more than 50 years after the liquidators started to dissolve the firm .
" there 's no serious basis for continuing the liquidation , " chief liquidators otto bernhardt and volker pollehn said on monday , after saying that they would register ig farben 's insolvency the same day . the two said financial problems on the part of investor wcm , an investment and real estate firm that had agreed to buy ig farben 's real estate holdings , led to the eventual bankruptcy . ig farben 's assets currently make up from € 5- € 10 million . angry protesters the press conference in frankfurt was accompanied by angry protesters .
demonstrators criticized the fact that former forced laborers will have no more recourse to compensation .
although bernhardt and pollehn established a foundation in 1999 to compensate them , it is only endowed with 500,000 deutschmarks -lrb- around € 256,000 or $ 293,000 -rrb- .
more money was supposed to be paid into the foundation eventually , but ig farben 's insolvency will prevent that .
all remaining assets are expected to go to the firm 's creditor banks , and the liquidators said it was unclear whether former forced laborers would receive compensation . forced laborers from western countries received compensation for their trials at ig farben plants in the 1950s , but many of those from eastern europe are still waiting .
ig farben was not involved in the fund established by germany in 2001 to compensate forced laborers . both bernhardt and pollehn and the association of critical shareholders in germany have speculated that the lively trading in ig farben shares on wednesday - just hours before the company announced possibly declaring insolvency - suggested insider trading .
the liquidators said they had not passed on information before the wednesday statement . besides bernhardt and pollehn , only ig farben 's supervisory board and the creditor banks were already aware of the situation , they said . " we believe the creditor banks should waive their claim to the money , " henry mathews , head of the association of critical shareholders , told deutsche welle .
" it is blood money that belongs to the former forced laborers not financial speculators .
the moral claims are undeniable . " intertwined with hitler 's regime ig farben was founded in 1925 .
even before the rise of the nazis in 1933 , the firm , then the world 's largest chemical manufacturer , was closely-affiliated with the national socialists .
it produced zyklon b , the gas that was used to kill prisoners in concentration camps , and exploited more than 80,000 forced laborers in labor and concentration camps . after world war ii , the allies stripped the firm of most of its assets , which were transferred to the three chemical firms bayer , hoechst -lrb- now aventis -rrb- and basf .
since then ig farben 's legal successor has been in the process of being liquidated , while its stocks continue to be traded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , € 1.5 billion have been paid to 817,000 claimants worldwide , a representative told dw-world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.11.2003 nazi chemical giant declares bankruptcy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners lined up for a hard labor assignment at auschwitz in poland during world war ii the infamous nazi poison-gas manufacturer ig farben is insolvent , possibly leaving thousands of former forced laborers trying to claim compensation out in the cold . the timing was ironic .
on sunday , germany mourned the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
on monday , i.g. farben , which manufactured the gas that killed nazi concentration camp prisoners , was declared insolvent , more than 50 years after the liquidators started to dissolve the firm .
" there 's no serious basis for continuing the liquidation , " chief liquidators otto bernhardt and volker pollehn said on monday , after saying that they would register ig farben 's insolvency the same day . the two said financial problems on the part of investor wcm , an investment and real estate firm that had agreed to buy ig farben 's real estate holdings , led to the eventual bankruptcy . ig farben 's assets currently make up from € 5- € 10 million . angry protesters the press conference in frankfurt was accompanied by angry protesters .
demonstrators criticized the fact that former forced laborers will have no more recourse to compensation .
although bernhardt and pollehn established a foundation in 1999 to compensate them , it is only endowed with 500,000 deutschmarks -lrb- around € 256,000 or $ 293,000 -rrb- .
more money was supposed to be paid into the foundation eventually , but ig farben 's insolvency will prevent that .
all remaining assets are expected to go to the firm 's creditor banks , and the liquidators said it was unclear whether former forced laborers would receive compensation . forced laborers from western countries received compensation for their trials at ig farben plants in the 1950s , but many of those from eastern europe are still waiting .
ig farben was not involved in the fund established by germany in 2001 to compensate forced laborers . both bernhardt and pollehn and the association of critical shareholders in germany have speculated that the lively trading in ig farben shares on wednesday - just hours before the company announced possibly declaring insolvency - suggested insider trading .
the liquidators said they had not passed on information before the wednesday statement . besides bernhardt and pollehn , only ig farben 's supervisory board and the creditor banks were already aware of the situation , they said . " we believe the creditor banks should waive their claim to the money , " henry mathews , head of the association of critical shareholders , told deutsche welle .
" it is blood money that belongs to the former forced laborers not financial speculators .

princess caroline of monaco has taken her fight against german tabloids to the european court for human rights in strasbourg .
she 's asking for europe-wide regulations on the paparazzi . germany 's claim to monaco royality , princess caroline , has taken a decade-long privacy dispute with the german tabloids to the european court typically charged with handling major human rights issues .
the wife of ernst august prince of hannover first filed suit against several german tabloids in 1993 , after they published paparazzi photos of her riding , shopping and sunbathing were published in several german celebrity magazines .
after germany 's consitutional court sidestepped the case in 1999 , caroline 's lawyers took it to european court for human rights , arguing that the photos are a violation of article 8 of the european human rights convention , which give her the right to protection of her private and family life .
caroline 's lawyer matthias prinz said his client wants europe-wide regulations such as those in france , where prominent people may only be photographed while carrying out public duties , unless otherwise agreed on .
prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .
but in germany , he said , the interests of the tabloid press seem to take priority .
robert schweizer , a board member of the burda verlag , which publishes several german celebrity magazines , said the hearing in strasbourg is not about the rights of the publishers , but rather the rights of millions of readers .
for them , caroline of monaco is a " role model , " he said , which is why they have a justifiable interest in information about her life .
public interest in germany about caroline 's life increased with her marriage to prince ernst august of hannover .
german press under fire the german tabloid press has been under seige as of late .
sweden 's queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf have hired prinz to prepare a lawsuit against several publications for printing what they allege are made-up stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline von monaco " we want to a legal answer to the question of whether these publications can simply write what they want , " said a royal spokeswoman .
prinz said there are at least 40 questionable reports about the swedish royals in the last 14 weeks alone , including reports that crown princess victoria had an abortion , and that silvia and carl gustaf were contemplating divorce .

christian democratic leaders are standing behind a member of parliament who called jews a " race of perpetrators " despite mounting criticism that they have failed to take adequate disciplinary measures . martin hohmann has been reprimanded by party leadership , he 's been ordered to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee in the german parliament and instead has been moved to the environmental committee .
he 's also been given an ultimatum by his party : cease with the anti-semitic remarks or face expulsion . but that 's about as far as party leadership is willing to go at the moment - out of fear that excluding him could create a huge rift within the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , germany 's leading opposition party . in the members ' forum on the party 's web site , postings include comments critical of the cdu 's failure to expel hohmann .
but there are also those who say that hohmann 's remarks , made in a speech in early october , were taken out of context and that the parliamentarian simply expressed the thoughts of many germans .
an army general who had voiced similar feelings about hohmann 's viewpoints was fired from his job last week . party defends decision to keep hohmann for more than a week now , the cdu 's leadership has been struggling to decide how best to deal with the parliamentarian .
soon after hohmann 's comments became public , party leader angela merkel apparently consider banishing him from the cdu 's parliamentary group , according to the newsmagazine der spiegel . but other party leaders warned merkel that hohmann could no longer be controlled after that .
while condemning hohmann 's remarks , the cdu leadership appears to want to deal with any reprimand of hohmann internally . " we have taken a clear and necessary step but we also consider it to be sufficient , " laurenz meyer , the party 's secretary general , said in a television talk show on sunday , referring to reprimanding hohmann and moving him over to the environmental beat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party leader angela merkel , left , and cdu secretay general laurenz meyer have decided to keep hohmann within the party for the time being .
hohmann 's comments were " unspeakable " and " intolerable , " meyer said .
but , he added , hohmann was definitely not a anti-semite " in the narrow sense " but rather a " fundamentalist in his views on the church . "
besides , expelling hohmann from the party could take years . roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the central german state of hesse , where hohmann is from , defended the party 's decision not to expel the parliamentarian while taking steps to distance himself from hohmann 's anti-semitic remarks .
koch did so during a speech at a frankfurt synagogue , causing more than a quarter of the audience to leave the room . bavarian permier edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , said hohmann 's actions would be closely observed from now on .
" he 's on the strictest kind of probation , " stoiber said .
" one more remark like that and it will be impossible for him to remain within the party . " growing calls to expel hohmann others have instead called upon the cdu to get rid of hohmann .
germany 's social democratic interior minister , otto schily , said he expected the cdu to conclude that " anyone agitating such a brown sauce again " should be expelled from its parliamentary group . jewish leaders expressed similar feelings .
" it 's intolerable , not only for those belonging to a minority , that someone who spreads right extremist ideas has a seat and a voice in the german parliament , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany , said on sunday . even within the cdu , some are starting to say that hohmann will have to go .
" if he does n't take the step himself , the parliamentary group and the party has to let him go , " dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern german state of thuringia , told the german wire service dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.11.2003 eu postpones decision on allowing gm foods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm crops have been the subject of many a demonstration in europe .
after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .
genetically modified foods are popularly referred to as “ franken food ” and consumers say they are extremely wary about buying food products whose genes have been spliced in laboratories .
retailers say they see no reason to offer more gm foods for sale until demand rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers , even those not specifically opposed to biotech crops , are also reluctant to go the biotech route , since sowing land with gm seeds is an economic gamble few are willing to take in the current environment .
others do not trust the science .
“ i ’ m afraid we simply don ’ t have enough information to make the right decision .
i ’ m also concerned that the tests we have so far are not conclusive enough to judge the long-term consequences , ” said carsten fedder , a farmer who chooses to grow a conventional rapeseed crops , even though several gm varieties have built-in insecticides .
proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .
they point to the many advantages modern genetic technology can provide , such as maize varieties which flourish even in the midst of drought or picture-perfect tomatoes that are extremely high in vitamin content .
scientists are even exploring creating foods that contain agents that are helpful in preventing diseases like uterine cancer .
“ we ’ ve basically shown that a potato can produce a vaccine , ” said sophie biemelt , a researcher the institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in gatersleben .
“ one could imagine one day getting vaccines from the food you eat . ”
but such arguments have thus far failed to sway a majority of europeans .
farmer carsten fedder said he prefers the genetics that nature gave his potatoes , or the rye that he also grows .
if he chose to grow the generically modified version of the grain , he would have higher yields , such as american farmers enjoy . still , fedder , whose children influence his views , insists he is not concerned .
“ the market here in europe is large enough , really .

after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .
genetically modified foods are popularly referred to as “ franken food ” and consumers say they are extremely wary about buying food products whose genes have been spliced in laboratories .
retailers say they see no reason to offer more gm foods for sale until demand rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers , even those not specifically opposed to biotech crops , are also reluctant to go the biotech route , since sowing land with gm seeds is an economic gamble few are willing to take in the current environment .
others do not trust the science .
“ i ’ m afraid we simply don ’ t have enough information to make the right decision .
i ’ m also concerned that the tests we have so far are not conclusive enough to judge the long-term consequences , ” said carsten fedder , a farmer who chooses to grow a conventional rapeseed crops , even though several gm varieties have built-in insecticides .
proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .
they point to the many advantages modern genetic technology can provide , such as maize varieties which flourish even in the midst of drought or picture-perfect tomatoes that are extremely high in vitamin content .
scientists are even exploring creating foods that contain agents that are helpful in preventing diseases like uterine cancer .
“ we ’ ve basically shown that a potato can produce a vaccine , ” said sophie biemelt , a researcher the institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in gatersleben .
“ one could imagine one day getting vaccines from the food you eat . ”
but such arguments have thus far failed to sway a majority of europeans .
farmer carsten fedder said he prefers the genetics that nature gave his potatoes , or the rye that he also grows .
if he chose to grow the generically modified version of the grain , he would have higher yields , such as american farmers enjoy . still , fedder , whose children influence his views , insists he is not concerned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.11.2003 human rights court hears princess ' paparazzi dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess caroline of monaco says paparazzi photos are a human rights violation .
princess caroline of monaco has taken her fight against german tabloids to the european court for human rights in strasbourg .
she 's asking for europe-wide regulations on the paparazzi . germany 's claim to monaco royality , princess caroline , has taken a decade-long privacy dispute with the german tabloids to the european court typically charged with handling major human rights issues .
the wife of ernst august prince of hannover first filed suit against several german tabloids in 1993 , after they published paparazzi photos of her riding , shopping and sunbathing were published in several german celebrity magazines .
after germany 's consitutional court sidestepped the case in 1999 , caroline 's lawyers took it to european court for human rights , arguing that the photos are a violation of article 8 of the european human rights convention , which give her the right to protection of her private and family life .
caroline 's lawyer matthias prinz said his client wants europe-wide regulations such as those in france , where prominent people may only be photographed while carrying out public duties , unless otherwise agreed on .
prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .
but in germany , he said , the interests of the tabloid press seem to take priority .
robert schweizer , a board member of the burda verlag , which publishes several german celebrity magazines , said the hearing in strasbourg is not about the rights of the publishers , but rather the rights of millions of readers .
for them , caroline of monaco is a " role model , " he said , which is why they have a justifiable interest in information about her life .
public interest in germany about caroline 's life increased with her marriage to prince ernst august of hannover .
german press under fire the german tabloid press has been under seige as of late .

on sunday , germany mourned the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
on monday , i.g. farben , which manufactured the gas that killed nazi concentration camp prisoners , was declared insolvent , more than 50 years after the liquidators started to dissolve the firm .
" there 's no serious basis for continuing the liquidation , " chief liquidators otto bernhardt and volker pollehn said on monday , after saying that they would register ig farben 's insolvency the same day . the two said financial problems on the part of investor wcm , an investment and real estate firm that had agreed to buy ig farben 's real estate holdings , led to the eventual bankruptcy . ig farben 's assets currently make up from € 5- € 10 million . angry protesters the press conference in frankfurt was accompanied by angry protesters .
demonstrators criticized the fact that former forced laborers will have no more recourse to compensation .
although bernhardt and pollehn established a foundation in 1999 to compensate them , it is only endowed with 500,000 deutschmarks -lrb- around € 256,000 or $ 293,000 -rrb- .
more money was supposed to be paid into the foundation eventually , but ig farben 's insolvency will prevent that .
all remaining assets are expected to go to the firm 's creditor banks , and the liquidators said it was unclear whether former forced laborers would receive compensation . forced laborers from western countries received compensation for their trials at ig farben plants in the 1950s , but many of those from eastern europe are still waiting .
ig farben was not involved in the fund established by germany in 2001 to compensate forced laborers . both bernhardt and pollehn and the association of critical shareholders in germany have speculated that the lively trading in ig farben shares on wednesday - just hours before the company announced possibly declaring insolvency - suggested insider trading .
the liquidators said they had not passed on information before the wednesday statement . besides bernhardt and pollehn , only ig farben 's supervisory board and the creditor banks were already aware of the situation , they said . " we believe the creditor banks should waive their claim to the money , " henry mathews , head of the association of critical shareholders , told deutsche welle .
" it is blood money that belongs to the former forced laborers not financial speculators .
the moral claims are undeniable . " intertwined with hitler 's regime ig farben was founded in 1925 .
even before the rise of the nazis in 1933 , the firm , then the world 's largest chemical manufacturer , was closely-affiliated with the national socialists .
it produced zyklon b , the gas that was used to kill prisoners in concentration camps , and exploited more than 80,000 forced laborers in labor and concentration camps . after world war ii , the allies stripped the firm of most of its assets , which were transferred to the three chemical firms bayer , hoechst -lrb- now aventis -rrb- and basf .

but there are also those who say that hohmann 's remarks , made in a speech in early october , were taken out of context and that the parliamentarian simply expressed the thoughts of many germans .

but there are also those who say that hohmann 's remarks , made in a speech in early october , were taken out of context and that the parliamentarian simply expressed the thoughts of many germans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.11.2003 eu postpones decision on allowing gm foods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm crops have been the subject of many a demonstration in europe .
after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .
genetically modified foods are popularly referred to as “ franken food ” and consumers say they are extremely wary about buying food products whose genes have been spliced in laboratories .
retailers say they see no reason to offer more gm foods for sale until demand rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers , even those not specifically opposed to biotech crops , are also reluctant to go the biotech route , since sowing land with gm seeds is an economic gamble few are willing to take in the current environment .
others do not trust the science .
“ i ’ m afraid we simply don ’ t have enough information to make the right decision .
i ’ m also concerned that the tests we have so far are not conclusive enough to judge the long-term consequences , ” said carsten fedder , a farmer who chooses to grow a conventional rapeseed crops , even though several gm varieties have built-in insecticides .
proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .
they point to the many advantages modern genetic technology can provide , such as maize varieties which flourish even in the midst of drought or picture-perfect tomatoes that are extremely high in vitamin content .
scientists are even exploring creating foods that contain agents that are helpful in preventing diseases like uterine cancer .
“ we ’ ve basically shown that a potato can produce a vaccine , ” said sophie biemelt , a researcher the institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in gatersleben .
“ one could imagine one day getting vaccines from the food you eat . ”
but such arguments have thus far failed to sway a majority of europeans .
farmer carsten fedder said he prefers the genetics that nature gave his potatoes , or the rye that he also grows .
if he chose to grow the generically modified version of the grain , he would have higher yields , such as american farmers enjoy . still , fedder , whose children influence his views , insists he is not concerned .

after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .

princess caroline of monaco has taken her fight against german tabloids to the european court for human rights in strasbourg .
she 's asking for europe-wide regulations on the paparazzi . germany 's claim to monaco royality , princess caroline , has taken a decade-long privacy dispute with the german tabloids to the european court typically charged with handling major human rights issues .
the wife of ernst august prince of hannover first filed suit against several german tabloids in 1993 , after they published paparazzi photos of her riding , shopping and sunbathing were published in several german celebrity magazines .
after germany 's consitutional court sidestepped the case in 1999 , caroline 's lawyers took it to european court for human rights , arguing that the photos are a violation of article 8 of the european human rights convention , which give her the right to protection of her private and family life .
caroline 's lawyer matthias prinz said his client wants europe-wide regulations such as those in france , where prominent people may only be photographed while carrying out public duties , unless otherwise agreed on .
prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .
but in germany , he said , the interests of the tabloid press seem to take priority .
robert schweizer , a board member of the burda verlag , which publishes several german celebrity magazines , said the hearing in strasbourg is not about the rights of the publishers , but rather the rights of millions of readers .
for them , caroline of monaco is a " role model , " he said , which is why they have a justifiable interest in information about her life .
public interest in germany about caroline 's life increased with her marriage to prince ernst august of hannover .
german press under fire the german tabloid press has been under seige as of late .
sweden 's queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf have hired prinz to prepare a lawsuit against several publications for printing what they allege are made-up stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline von monaco " we want to a legal answer to the question of whether these publications can simply write what they want , " said a royal spokeswoman .
prinz said there are at least 40 questionable reports about the swedish royals in the last 14 weeks alone , including reports that crown princess victoria had an abortion , and that silvia and carl gustaf were contemplating divorce .

princess caroline of monaco has taken her fight against german tabloids to the european court for human rights in strasbourg .
she 's asking for europe-wide regulations on the paparazzi . germany 's claim to monaco royality , princess caroline , has taken a decade-long privacy dispute with the german tabloids to the european court typically charged with handling major human rights issues .
the wife of ernst august prince of hannover first filed suit against several german tabloids in 1993 , after they published paparazzi photos of her riding , shopping and sunbathing were published in several german celebrity magazines .
after germany 's consitutional court sidestepped the case in 1999 , caroline 's lawyers took it to european court for human rights , arguing that the photos are a violation of article 8 of the european human rights convention , which give her the right to protection of her private and family life .
caroline 's lawyer matthias prinz said his client wants europe-wide regulations such as those in france , where prominent people may only be photographed while carrying out public duties , unless otherwise agreed on .
prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .

on sunday , germany mourned the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
on monday , i.g. farben , which manufactured the gas that killed nazi concentration camp prisoners , was declared insolvent , more than 50 years after the liquidators started to dissolve the firm .
" there 's no serious basis for continuing the liquidation , " chief liquidators otto bernhardt and volker pollehn said on monday , after saying that they would register ig farben 's insolvency the same day . the two said financial problems on the part of investor wcm , an investment and real estate firm that had agreed to buy ig farben 's real estate holdings , led to the eventual bankruptcy . ig farben 's assets currently make up from € 5- € 10 million . angry protesters the press conference in frankfurt was accompanied by angry protesters .
demonstrators criticized the fact that former forced laborers will have no more recourse to compensation .
although bernhardt and pollehn established a foundation in 1999 to compensate them , it is only endowed with 500,000 deutschmarks -lrb- around € 256,000 or $ 293,000 -rrb- .
more money was supposed to be paid into the foundation eventually , but ig farben 's insolvency will prevent that .
all remaining assets are expected to go to the firm 's creditor banks , and the liquidators said it was unclear whether former forced laborers would receive compensation . forced laborers from western countries received compensation for their trials at ig farben plants in the 1950s , but many of those from eastern europe are still waiting .
ig farben was not involved in the fund established by germany in 2001 to compensate forced laborers . both bernhardt and pollehn and the association of critical shareholders in germany have speculated that the lively trading in ig farben shares on wednesday - just hours before the company announced possibly declaring insolvency - suggested insider trading .
the liquidators said they had not passed on information before the wednesday statement . besides bernhardt and pollehn , only ig farben 's supervisory board and the creditor banks were already aware of the situation , they said . " we believe the creditor banks should waive their claim to the money , " henry mathews , head of the association of critical shareholders , told deutsche welle .
" it is blood money that belongs to the former forced laborers not financial speculators .

the european union has warned u.s. president george w. bush to remove the 20-month-old tariffs , put in place to protect the ailing american steel industry , or face retaliation , which could include $ 2.2 billion in duties on u.s. goods .
the eu , along with a group of countries including japan , brazil , south korea and switzerland , had filed a complaint with the geneva-based wto complaining that the steel duties were a barrier to free trade .
the united states had argued that the duties , which were initially for up to 30 percent but which were later lowered , were necessary to protect u.s. steel makers from a flood of cheap imports , but a panel of wto judges disagreed .
the 22 countries that filed complaints hailed the decision .
" it leaves the united states with no other choice but to terminate its wto incompatible safeguard measures without delay , " they said in a joint statement . more briefs 07.11.2003 -pipe- consumer advocates sue kellogg germany 07.11.2003 -pipe- deutsche post profits plummet 07.11.2003 -pipe- bmw says new models helping strengthen bottom line 06.11.2003 -pipe- bertelsmann , sony to merge music companies 06.11.2003 -pipe- journalist 's insider trading conviction thrown out 06.11.2003 -pipe- journalist 's insider trading conviction thrown out 05.11.2003 -pipe- german magazine market bouncing back 05.11.2003 -pipe- budget airline easyjet on expansion course in germany 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

christian democratic leaders are standing behind a member of parliament who called jews a " race of perpetrators " despite mounting criticism that they have failed to take adequate disciplinary measures . martin hohmann has been reprimanded by party leadership , he 's been ordered to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee in the german parliament and instead has been moved to the environmental committee .
he 's also been given an ultimatum by his party : cease with the anti-semitic remarks or face expulsion . but that 's about as far as party leadership is willing to go at the moment - out of fear that excluding him could create a huge rift within the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , germany 's leading opposition party . in the members ' forum on the party 's web site , postings include comments critical of the cdu 's failure to expel hohmann .
but there are also those who say that hohmann 's remarks , made in a speech in early october , were taken out of context and that the parliamentarian simply expressed the thoughts of many germans .
an army general who had voiced similar feelings about hohmann 's viewpoints was fired from his job last week . party defends decision to keep hohmann for more than a week now , the cdu 's leadership has been struggling to decide how best to deal with the parliamentarian .
soon after hohmann 's comments became public , party leader angela merkel apparently consider banishing him from the cdu 's parliamentary group , according to the newsmagazine der spiegel . but other party leaders warned merkel that hohmann could no longer be controlled after that .
while condemning hohmann 's remarks , the cdu leadership appears to want to deal with any reprimand of hohmann internally . " we have taken a clear and necessary step but we also consider it to be sufficient , " laurenz meyer , the party 's secretary general , said in a television talk show on sunday , referring to reprimanding hohmann and moving him over to the environmental beat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party leader angela merkel , left , and cdu secretay general laurenz meyer have decided to keep hohmann within the party for the time being .
hohmann 's comments were " unspeakable " and " intolerable , " meyer said .
but , he added , hohmann was definitely not a anti-semite " in the narrow sense " but rather a " fundamentalist in his views on the church . "
besides , expelling hohmann from the party could take years . roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the central german state of hesse , where hohmann is from , defended the party 's decision not to expel the parliamentarian while taking steps to distance himself from hohmann 's anti-semitic remarks .
koch did so during a speech at a frankfurt synagogue , causing more than a quarter of the audience to leave the room . bavarian permier edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , said hohmann 's actions would be closely observed from now on .
" he 's on the strictest kind of probation , " stoiber said .
" one more remark like that and it will be impossible for him to remain within the party . " growing calls to expel hohmann others have instead called upon the cdu to get rid of hohmann .
germany 's social democratic interior minister , otto schily , said he expected the cdu to conclude that " anyone agitating such a brown sauce again " should be expelled from its parliamentary group . jewish leaders expressed similar feelings .
" it 's intolerable , not only for those belonging to a minority , that someone who spreads right extremist ideas has a seat and a voice in the german parliament , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany , said on sunday . even within the cdu , some are starting to say that hohmann will have to go .
" if he does n't take the step himself , the parliamentary group and the party has to let him go , " dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern german state of thuringia , told the german wire service dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

on sunday , germany mourned the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
on monday , i.g. farben , which manufactured the gas that killed nazi concentration camp prisoners , was declared insolvent , more than 50 years after the liquidators started to dissolve the firm .
" there 's no serious basis for continuing the liquidation , " chief liquidators otto bernhardt and volker pollehn said on monday , after saying that they would register ig farben 's insolvency the same day . the two said financial problems on the part of investor wcm , an investment and real estate firm that had agreed to buy ig farben 's real estate holdings , led to the eventual bankruptcy . ig farben 's assets currently make up from € 5- € 10 million . angry protesters the press conference in frankfurt was accompanied by angry protesters .
demonstrators criticized the fact that former forced laborers will have no more recourse to compensation .
although bernhardt and pollehn established a foundation in 1999 to compensate them , it is only endowed with 500,000 deutschmarks -lrb- around € 256,000 or $ 293,000 -rrb- .
more money was supposed to be paid into the foundation eventually , but ig farben 's insolvency will prevent that .
all remaining assets are expected to go to the firm 's creditor banks , and the liquidators said it was unclear whether former forced laborers would receive compensation . forced laborers from western countries received compensation for their trials at ig farben plants in the 1950s , but many of those from eastern europe are still waiting .
ig farben was not involved in the fund established by germany in 2001 to compensate forced laborers . both bernhardt and pollehn and the association of critical shareholders in germany have speculated that the lively trading in ig farben shares on wednesday - just hours before the company announced possibly declaring insolvency - suggested insider trading .
the liquidators said they had not passed on information before the wednesday statement . besides bernhardt and pollehn , only ig farben 's supervisory board and the creditor banks were already aware of the situation , they said . " we believe the creditor banks should waive their claim to the money , " henry mathews , head of the association of critical shareholders , told deutsche welle .
" it is blood money that belongs to the former forced laborers not financial speculators .
the moral claims are undeniable . " intertwined with hitler 's regime ig farben was founded in 1925 .
even before the rise of the nazis in 1933 , the firm , then the world 's largest chemical manufacturer , was closely-affiliated with the national socialists .
it produced zyklon b , the gas that was used to kill prisoners in concentration camps , and exploited more than 80,000 forced laborers in labor and concentration camps . after world war ii , the allies stripped the firm of most of its assets , which were transferred to the three chemical firms bayer , hoechst -lrb- now aventis -rrb- and basf .
since then ig farben 's legal successor has been in the process of being liquidated , while its stocks continue to be traded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , € 1.5 billion have been paid to 817,000 claimants worldwide , a representative told dw-world .

princess caroline of monaco has taken her fight against german tabloids to the european court for human rights in strasbourg .
she 's asking for europe-wide regulations on the paparazzi . germany 's claim to monaco royality , princess caroline , has taken a decade-long privacy dispute with the german tabloids to the european court typically charged with handling major human rights issues .
the wife of ernst august prince of hannover first filed suit against several german tabloids in 1993 , after they published paparazzi photos of her riding , shopping and sunbathing were published in several german celebrity magazines .
after germany 's consitutional court sidestepped the case in 1999 , caroline 's lawyers took it to european court for human rights , arguing that the photos are a violation of article 8 of the european human rights convention , which give her the right to protection of her private and family life .
caroline 's lawyer matthias prinz said his client wants europe-wide regulations such as those in france , where prominent people may only be photographed while carrying out public duties , unless otherwise agreed on .
prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .
but in germany , he said , the interests of the tabloid press seem to take priority .
robert schweizer , a board member of the burda verlag , which publishes several german celebrity magazines , said the hearing in strasbourg is not about the rights of the publishers , but rather the rights of millions of readers .
for them , caroline of monaco is a " role model , " he said , which is why they have a justifiable interest in information about her life .
public interest in germany about caroline 's life increased with her marriage to prince ernst august of hannover .
german press under fire the german tabloid press has been under seige as of late .
sweden 's queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf have hired prinz to prepare a lawsuit against several publications for printing what they allege are made-up stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline von monaco " we want to a legal answer to the question of whether these publications can simply write what they want , " said a royal spokeswoman .
prinz said there are at least 40 questionable reports about the swedish royals in the last 14 weeks alone , including reports that crown princess victoria had an abortion , and that silvia and carl gustaf were contemplating divorce .

princess caroline of monaco has taken her fight against german tabloids to the european court for human rights in strasbourg .
she 's asking for europe-wide regulations on the paparazzi . germany 's claim to monaco royality , princess caroline , has taken a decade-long privacy dispute with the german tabloids to the european court typically charged with handling major human rights issues .
the wife of ernst august prince of hannover first filed suit against several german tabloids in 1993 , after they published paparazzi photos of her riding , shopping and sunbathing were published in several german celebrity magazines .
after germany 's consitutional court sidestepped the case in 1999 , caroline 's lawyers took it to european court for human rights , arguing that the photos are a violation of article 8 of the european human rights convention , which give her the right to protection of her private and family life .
caroline 's lawyer matthias prinz said his client wants europe-wide regulations such as those in france , where prominent people may only be photographed while carrying out public duties , unless otherwise agreed on .
prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .
but in germany , he said , the interests of the tabloid press seem to take priority .

christian democratic leaders are standing behind a member of parliament who called jews a " race of perpetrators " despite mounting criticism that they have failed to take adequate disciplinary measures . martin hohmann has been reprimanded by party leadership , he 's been ordered to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee in the german parliament and instead has been moved to the environmental committee .
he 's also been given an ultimatum by his party : cease with the anti-semitic remarks or face expulsion . but that 's about as far as party leadership is willing to go at the moment - out of fear that excluding him could create a huge rift within the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , germany 's leading opposition party . in the members ' forum on the party 's web site , postings include comments critical of the cdu 's failure to expel hohmann .
but there are also those who say that hohmann 's remarks , made in a speech in early october , were taken out of context and that the parliamentarian simply expressed the thoughts of many germans .
an army general who had voiced similar feelings about hohmann 's viewpoints was fired from his job last week . party defends decision to keep hohmann for more than a week now , the cdu 's leadership has been struggling to decide how best to deal with the parliamentarian .
soon after hohmann 's comments became public , party leader angela merkel apparently consider banishing him from the cdu 's parliamentary group , according to the newsmagazine der spiegel . but other party leaders warned merkel that hohmann could no longer be controlled after that .
while condemning hohmann 's remarks , the cdu leadership appears to want to deal with any reprimand of hohmann internally . " we have taken a clear and necessary step but we also consider it to be sufficient , " laurenz meyer , the party 's secretary general , said in a television talk show on sunday , referring to reprimanding hohmann and moving him over to the environmental beat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party leader angela merkel , left , and cdu secretay general laurenz meyer have decided to keep hohmann within the party for the time being .
hohmann 's comments were " unspeakable " and " intolerable , " meyer said .
but , he added , hohmann was definitely not a anti-semite " in the narrow sense " but rather a " fundamentalist in his views on the church . "
besides , expelling hohmann from the party could take years . roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the central german state of hesse , where hohmann is from , defended the party 's decision not to expel the parliamentarian while taking steps to distance himself from hohmann 's anti-semitic remarks .
koch did so during a speech at a frankfurt synagogue , causing more than a quarter of the audience to leave the room . bavarian permier edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , said hohmann 's actions would be closely observed from now on .
" he 's on the strictest kind of probation , " stoiber said .
" one more remark like that and it will be impossible for him to remain within the party . " growing calls to expel hohmann others have instead called upon the cdu to get rid of hohmann .
germany 's social democratic interior minister , otto schily , said he expected the cdu to conclude that " anyone agitating such a brown sauce again " should be expelled from its parliamentary group . jewish leaders expressed similar feelings .
" it 's intolerable , not only for those belonging to a minority , that someone who spreads right extremist ideas has a seat and a voice in the german parliament , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany , said on sunday . even within the cdu , some are starting to say that hohmann will have to go .
" if he does n't take the step himself , the parliamentary group and the party has to let him go , " dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern german state of thuringia , told the german wire service dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .

the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .
genetically modified foods are popularly referred to as “ franken food ” and consumers say they are extremely wary about buying food products whose genes have been spliced in laboratories .
retailers say they see no reason to offer more gm foods for sale until demand rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers , even those not specifically opposed to biotech crops , are also reluctant to go the biotech route , since sowing land with gm seeds is an economic gamble few are willing to take in the current environment .

i ’ m also concerned that the tests we have so far are not conclusive enough to judge the long-term consequences , ” said carsten fedder , a farmer who chooses to grow a conventional rapeseed crops , even though several gm varieties have built-in insecticides .
proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .
they point to the many advantages modern genetic technology can provide , such as maize varieties which flourish even in the midst of drought or picture-perfect tomatoes that are extremely high in vitamin content .
scientists are even exploring creating foods that contain agents that are helpful in preventing diseases like uterine cancer .
“ we ’ ve basically shown that a potato can produce a vaccine , ” said sophie biemelt , a researcher the institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in gatersleben .

“ we ’ ve basically shown that a potato can produce a vaccine , ” said sophie biemelt , a researcher the institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in gatersleben .
“ one could imagine one day getting vaccines from the food you eat . ”
but such arguments have thus far failed to sway a majority of europeans .
farmer carsten fedder said he prefers the genetics that nature gave his potatoes , or the rye that he also grows .
if he chose to grow the generically modified version of the grain , he would have higher yields , such as american farmers enjoy . still , fedder , whose children influence his views , insists he is not concerned .

christian democratic leaders are standing behind a member of parliament who called jews a " race of perpetrators " despite mounting criticism that they have failed to take adequate disciplinary measures . martin hohmann has been reprimanded by party leadership , he 's been ordered to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee in the german parliament and instead has been moved to the environmental committee .
he 's also been given an ultimatum by his party : cease with the anti-semitic remarks or face expulsion . but that 's about as far as party leadership is willing to go at the moment - out of fear that excluding him could create a huge rift within the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , germany 's leading opposition party . in the members ' forum on the party 's web site , postings include comments critical of the cdu 's failure to expel hohmann .
but there are also those who say that hohmann 's remarks , made in a speech in early october , were taken out of context and that the parliamentarian simply expressed the thoughts of many germans .
an army general who had voiced similar feelings about hohmann 's viewpoints was fired from his job last week . party defends decision to keep hohmann for more than a week now , the cdu 's leadership has been struggling to decide how best to deal with the parliamentarian .
soon after hohmann 's comments became public , party leader angela merkel apparently consider banishing him from the cdu 's parliamentary group , according to the newsmagazine der spiegel . but other party leaders warned merkel that hohmann could no longer be controlled after that .
while condemning hohmann 's remarks , the cdu leadership appears to want to deal with any reprimand of hohmann internally . " we have taken a clear and necessary step but we also consider it to be sufficient , " laurenz meyer , the party 's secretary general , said in a television talk show on sunday , referring to reprimanding hohmann and moving him over to the environmental beat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party leader angela merkel , left , and cdu secretay general laurenz meyer have decided to keep hohmann within the party for the time being .
hohmann 's comments were " unspeakable " and " intolerable , " meyer said .
but , he added , hohmann was definitely not a anti-semite " in the narrow sense " but rather a " fundamentalist in his views on the church . "
besides , expelling hohmann from the party could take years . roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the central german state of hesse , where hohmann is from , defended the party 's decision not to expel the parliamentarian while taking steps to distance himself from hohmann 's anti-semitic remarks .
koch did so during a speech at a frankfurt synagogue , causing more than a quarter of the audience to leave the room . bavarian permier edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , said hohmann 's actions would be closely observed from now on .
" he 's on the strictest kind of probation , " stoiber said .
" one more remark like that and it will be impossible for him to remain within the party . " growing calls to expel hohmann others have instead called upon the cdu to get rid of hohmann .
germany 's social democratic interior minister , otto schily , said he expected the cdu to conclude that " anyone agitating such a brown sauce again " should be expelled from its parliamentary group . jewish leaders expressed similar feelings .
" it 's intolerable , not only for those belonging to a minority , that someone who spreads right extremist ideas has a seat and a voice in the german parliament , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany , said on sunday . even within the cdu , some are starting to say that hohmann will have to go .
" if he does n't take the step himself , the parliamentary group and the party has to let him go , " dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern german state of thuringia , told the german wire service dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

princess caroline of monaco has taken her fight against german tabloids to the european court for human rights in strasbourg .
she 's asking for europe-wide regulations on the paparazzi . germany 's claim to monaco royality , princess caroline , has taken a decade-long privacy dispute with the german tabloids to the european court typically charged with handling major human rights issues .
the wife of ernst august prince of hannover first filed suit against several german tabloids in 1993 , after they published paparazzi photos of her riding , shopping and sunbathing were published in several german celebrity magazines .
after germany 's consitutional court sidestepped the case in 1999 , caroline 's lawyers took it to european court for human rights , arguing that the photos are a violation of article 8 of the european human rights convention , which give her the right to protection of her private and family life .
caroline 's lawyer matthias prinz said his client wants europe-wide regulations such as those in france , where prominent people may only be photographed while carrying out public duties , unless otherwise agreed on .
prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .
but in germany , he said , the interests of the tabloid press seem to take priority .
robert schweizer , a board member of the burda verlag , which publishes several german celebrity magazines , said the hearing in strasbourg is not about the rights of the publishers , but rather the rights of millions of readers .
for them , caroline of monaco is a " role model , " he said , which is why they have a justifiable interest in information about her life .
public interest in germany about caroline 's life increased with her marriage to prince ernst august of hannover .
german press under fire the german tabloid press has been under seige as of late .
sweden 's queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf have hired prinz to prepare a lawsuit against several publications for printing what they allege are made-up stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline von monaco " we want to a legal answer to the question of whether these publications can simply write what they want , " said a royal spokeswoman .
prinz said there are at least 40 questionable reports about the swedish royals in the last 14 weeks alone , including reports that crown princess victoria had an abortion , and that silvia and carl gustaf were contemplating divorce .
they have the support of norway ’ s monarchs , who have publicly criticised the german press for making up stories about crown prince haakon , his wife , princess mette-marit , as well as other members of the norwegian royal family . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .

they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .

proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.11.2003 eu postpones decision on allowing gm foods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm crops have been the subject of many a demonstration in europe .
after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .
genetically modified foods are popularly referred to as “ franken food ” and consumers say they are extremely wary about buying food products whose genes have been spliced in laboratories .
retailers say they see no reason to offer more gm foods for sale until demand rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers , even those not specifically opposed to biotech crops , are also reluctant to go the biotech route , since sowing land with gm seeds is an economic gamble few are willing to take in the current environment .
others do not trust the science .
“ i ’ m afraid we simply don ’ t have enough information to make the right decision .
i ’ m also concerned that the tests we have so far are not conclusive enough to judge the long-term consequences , ” said carsten fedder , a farmer who chooses to grow a conventional rapeseed crops , even though several gm varieties have built-in insecticides .
proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .

on sunday , germany mourned the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
on monday , i.g. farben , which manufactured the gas that killed nazi concentration camp prisoners , was declared insolvent , more than 50 years after the liquidators started to dissolve the firm .
" there 's no serious basis for continuing the liquidation , " chief liquidators otto bernhardt and volker pollehn said on monday , after saying that they would register ig farben 's insolvency the same day . the two said financial problems on the part of investor wcm , an investment and real estate firm that had agreed to buy ig farben 's real estate holdings , led to the eventual bankruptcy . ig farben 's assets currently make up from € 5- € 10 million . angry protesters the press conference in frankfurt was accompanied by angry protesters .
demonstrators criticized the fact that former forced laborers will have no more recourse to compensation .
although bernhardt and pollehn established a foundation in 1999 to compensate them , it is only endowed with 500,000 deutschmarks -lrb- around € 256,000 or $ 293,000 -rrb- .
more money was supposed to be paid into the foundation eventually , but ig farben 's insolvency will prevent that .
all remaining assets are expected to go to the firm 's creditor banks , and the liquidators said it was unclear whether former forced laborers would receive compensation . forced laborers from western countries received compensation for their trials at ig farben plants in the 1950s , but many of those from eastern europe are still waiting .
ig farben was not involved in the fund established by germany in 2001 to compensate forced laborers . both bernhardt and pollehn and the association of critical shareholders in germany have speculated that the lively trading in ig farben shares on wednesday - just hours before the company announced possibly declaring insolvency - suggested insider trading .
the liquidators said they had not passed on information before the wednesday statement . besides bernhardt and pollehn , only ig farben 's supervisory board and the creditor banks were already aware of the situation , they said . " we believe the creditor banks should waive their claim to the money , " henry mathews , head of the association of critical shareholders , told deutsche welle .
" it is blood money that belongs to the former forced laborers not financial speculators .
the moral claims are undeniable . " intertwined with hitler 's regime ig farben was founded in 1925 .
even before the rise of the nazis in 1933 , the firm , then the world 's largest chemical manufacturer , was closely-affiliated with the national socialists .
it produced zyklon b , the gas that was used to kill prisoners in concentration camps , and exploited more than 80,000 forced laborers in labor and concentration camps . after world war ii , the allies stripped the firm of most of its assets , which were transferred to the three chemical firms bayer , hoechst -lrb- now aventis -rrb- and basf .
since then ig farben 's legal successor has been in the process of being liquidated , while its stocks continue to be traded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , € 1.5 billion have been paid to 817,000 claimants worldwide , a representative told dw-world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.11.2003 eu postpones decision on allowing gm foods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm crops have been the subject of many a demonstration in europe .
after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .

after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .

the european union has warned u.s. president george w. bush to remove the 20-month-old tariffs , put in place to protect the ailing american steel industry , or face retaliation , which could include $ 2.2 billion in duties on u.s. goods .
the eu , along with a group of countries including japan , brazil , south korea and switzerland , had filed a complaint with the geneva-based wto complaining that the steel duties were a barrier to free trade .
the united states had argued that the duties , which were initially for up to 30 percent but which were later lowered , were necessary to protect u.s. steel makers from a flood of cheap imports , but a panel of wto judges disagreed .
the 22 countries that filed complaints hailed the decision .

after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .
genetically modified foods are popularly referred to as “ franken food ” and consumers say they are extremely wary about buying food products whose genes have been spliced in laboratories .
retailers say they see no reason to offer more gm foods for sale until demand rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers , even those not specifically opposed to biotech crops , are also reluctant to go the biotech route , since sowing land with gm seeds is an economic gamble few are willing to take in the current environment .
others do not trust the science .
“ i ’ m afraid we simply don ’ t have enough information to make the right decision .
i ’ m also concerned that the tests we have so far are not conclusive enough to judge the long-term consequences , ” said carsten fedder , a farmer who chooses to grow a conventional rapeseed crops , even though several gm varieties have built-in insecticides .
proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .
they point to the many advantages modern genetic technology can provide , such as maize varieties which flourish even in the midst of drought or picture-perfect tomatoes that are extremely high in vitamin content .
scientists are even exploring creating foods that contain agents that are helpful in preventing diseases like uterine cancer .
“ we ’ ve basically shown that a potato can produce a vaccine , ” said sophie biemelt , a researcher the institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in gatersleben .
“ one could imagine one day getting vaccines from the food you eat . ”
but such arguments have thus far failed to sway a majority of europeans .
farmer carsten fedder said he prefers the genetics that nature gave his potatoes , or the rye that he also grows .

princess caroline of monaco has taken her fight against german tabloids to the european court for human rights in strasbourg .
she 's asking for europe-wide regulations on the paparazzi . germany 's claim to monaco royality , princess caroline , has taken a decade-long privacy dispute with the german tabloids to the european court typically charged with handling major human rights issues .
the wife of ernst august prince of hannover first filed suit against several german tabloids in 1993 , after they published paparazzi photos of her riding , shopping and sunbathing were published in several german celebrity magazines .
after germany 's consitutional court sidestepped the case in 1999 , caroline 's lawyers took it to european court for human rights , arguing that the photos are a violation of article 8 of the european human rights convention , which give her the right to protection of her private and family life .
caroline 's lawyer matthias prinz said his client wants europe-wide regulations such as those in france , where prominent people may only be photographed while carrying out public duties , unless otherwise agreed on .
prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .
but in germany , he said , the interests of the tabloid press seem to take priority .
robert schweizer , a board member of the burda verlag , which publishes several german celebrity magazines , said the hearing in strasbourg is not about the rights of the publishers , but rather the rights of millions of readers .
for them , caroline of monaco is a " role model , " he said , which is why they have a justifiable interest in information about her life .
public interest in germany about caroline 's life increased with her marriage to prince ernst august of hannover .
german press under fire the german tabloid press has been under seige as of late .
sweden 's queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf have hired prinz to prepare a lawsuit against several publications for printing what they allege are made-up stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline von monaco " we want to a legal answer to the question of whether these publications can simply write what they want , " said a royal spokeswoman .
prinz said there are at least 40 questionable reports about the swedish royals in the last 14 weeks alone , including reports that crown princess victoria had an abortion , and that silvia and carl gustaf were contemplating divorce .
they have the support of norway ’ s monarchs , who have publicly criticised the german press for making up stories about crown prince haakon , his wife , princess mette-marit , as well as other members of the norwegian royal family . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .
but in germany , he said , the interests of the tabloid press seem to take priority .
robert schweizer , a board member of the burda verlag , which publishes several german celebrity magazines , said the hearing in strasbourg is not about the rights of the publishers , but rather the rights of millions of readers .
for them , caroline of monaco is a " role model , " he said , which is why they have a justifiable interest in information about her life .
public interest in germany about caroline 's life increased with her marriage to prince ernst august of hannover .

christian democratic leaders are standing behind a member of parliament who called jews a " race of perpetrators " despite mounting criticism that they have failed to take adequate disciplinary measures . martin hohmann has been reprimanded by party leadership , he 's been ordered to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee in the german parliament and instead has been moved to the environmental committee .
he 's also been given an ultimatum by his party : cease with the anti-semitic remarks or face expulsion . but that 's about as far as party leadership is willing to go at the moment - out of fear that excluding him could create a huge rift within the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , germany 's leading opposition party . in the members ' forum on the party 's web site , postings include comments critical of the cdu 's failure to expel hohmann .
but there are also those who say that hohmann 's remarks , made in a speech in early october , were taken out of context and that the parliamentarian simply expressed the thoughts of many germans .
an army general who had voiced similar feelings about hohmann 's viewpoints was fired from his job last week . party defends decision to keep hohmann for more than a week now , the cdu 's leadership has been struggling to decide how best to deal with the parliamentarian .
soon after hohmann 's comments became public , party leader angela merkel apparently consider banishing him from the cdu 's parliamentary group , according to the newsmagazine der spiegel . but other party leaders warned merkel that hohmann could no longer be controlled after that .
while condemning hohmann 's remarks , the cdu leadership appears to want to deal with any reprimand of hohmann internally . " we have taken a clear and necessary step but we also consider it to be sufficient , " laurenz meyer , the party 's secretary general , said in a television talk show on sunday , referring to reprimanding hohmann and moving him over to the environmental beat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party leader angela merkel , left , and cdu secretay general laurenz meyer have decided to keep hohmann within the party for the time being .
hohmann 's comments were " unspeakable " and " intolerable , " meyer said .
but , he added , hohmann was definitely not a anti-semite " in the narrow sense " but rather a " fundamentalist in his views on the church . "
besides , expelling hohmann from the party could take years . roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the central german state of hesse , where hohmann is from , defended the party 's decision not to expel the parliamentarian while taking steps to distance himself from hohmann 's anti-semitic remarks .
koch did so during a speech at a frankfurt synagogue , causing more than a quarter of the audience to leave the room . bavarian permier edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , said hohmann 's actions would be closely observed from now on .
" he 's on the strictest kind of probation , " stoiber said .
" one more remark like that and it will be impossible for him to remain within the party . " growing calls to expel hohmann others have instead called upon the cdu to get rid of hohmann .
germany 's social democratic interior minister , otto schily , said he expected the cdu to conclude that " anyone agitating such a brown sauce again " should be expelled from its parliamentary group . jewish leaders expressed similar feelings .
" it 's intolerable , not only for those belonging to a minority , that someone who spreads right extremist ideas has a seat and a voice in the german parliament , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany , said on sunday . even within the cdu , some are starting to say that hohmann will have to go .
" if he does n't take the step himself , the parliamentary group and the party has to let him go , " dieter althaus , the premier of the eastern german state of thuringia , told the german wire service dpa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliamentarian calls jews " race of perpetrators " nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community .

on sunday , germany mourned the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
on monday , i.g. farben , which manufactured the gas that killed nazi concentration camp prisoners , was declared insolvent , more than 50 years after the liquidators started to dissolve the firm .
" there 's no serious basis for continuing the liquidation , " chief liquidators otto bernhardt and volker pollehn said on monday , after saying that they would register ig farben 's insolvency the same day . the two said financial problems on the part of investor wcm , an investment and real estate firm that had agreed to buy ig farben 's real estate holdings , led to the eventual bankruptcy . ig farben 's assets currently make up from € 5- € 10 million . angry protesters the press conference in frankfurt was accompanied by angry protesters .
demonstrators criticized the fact that former forced laborers will have no more recourse to compensation .
although bernhardt and pollehn established a foundation in 1999 to compensate them , it is only endowed with 500,000 deutschmarks -lrb- around € 256,000 or $ 293,000 -rrb- .
more money was supposed to be paid into the foundation eventually , but ig farben 's insolvency will prevent that .
all remaining assets are expected to go to the firm 's creditor banks , and the liquidators said it was unclear whether former forced laborers would receive compensation . forced laborers from western countries received compensation for their trials at ig farben plants in the 1950s , but many of those from eastern europe are still waiting .
ig farben was not involved in the fund established by germany in 2001 to compensate forced laborers . both bernhardt and pollehn and the association of critical shareholders in germany have speculated that the lively trading in ig farben shares on wednesday - just hours before the company announced possibly declaring insolvency - suggested insider trading .
the liquidators said they had not passed on information before the wednesday statement . besides bernhardt and pollehn , only ig farben 's supervisory board and the creditor banks were already aware of the situation , they said . " we believe the creditor banks should waive their claim to the money , " henry mathews , head of the association of critical shareholders , told deutsche welle .
" it is blood money that belongs to the former forced laborers not financial speculators .
the moral claims are undeniable . " intertwined with hitler 's regime ig farben was founded in 1925 .
even before the rise of the nazis in 1933 , the firm , then the world 's largest chemical manufacturer , was closely-affiliated with the national socialists .
it produced zyklon b , the gas that was used to kill prisoners in concentration camps , and exploited more than 80,000 forced laborers in labor and concentration camps . after world war ii , the allies stripped the firm of most of its assets , which were transferred to the three chemical firms bayer , hoechst -lrb- now aventis -rrb- and basf .
since then ig farben 's legal successor has been in the process of being liquidated , while its stocks continue to be traded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , € 1.5 billion have been paid to 817,000 claimants worldwide , a representative told dw-world .

princess caroline of monaco has taken her fight against german tabloids to the european court for human rights in strasbourg .
she 's asking for europe-wide regulations on the paparazzi . germany 's claim to monaco royality , princess caroline , has taken a decade-long privacy dispute with the german tabloids to the european court typically charged with handling major human rights issues .
the wife of ernst august prince of hannover first filed suit against several german tabloids in 1993 , after they published paparazzi photos of her riding , shopping and sunbathing were published in several german celebrity magazines .
after germany 's consitutional court sidestepped the case in 1999 , caroline 's lawyers took it to european court for human rights , arguing that the photos are a violation of article 8 of the european human rights convention , which give her the right to protection of her private and family life .
caroline 's lawyer matthias prinz said his client wants europe-wide regulations such as those in france , where prominent people may only be photographed while carrying out public duties , unless otherwise agreed on .
prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .
but in germany , he said , the interests of the tabloid press seem to take priority .
robert schweizer , a board member of the burda verlag , which publishes several german celebrity magazines , said the hearing in strasbourg is not about the rights of the publishers , but rather the rights of millions of readers .
for them , caroline of monaco is a " role model , " he said , which is why they have a justifiable interest in information about her life .
public interest in germany about caroline 's life increased with her marriage to prince ernst august of hannover .
german press under fire the german tabloid press has been under seige as of late .
sweden 's queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf have hired prinz to prepare a lawsuit against several publications for printing what they allege are made-up stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline von monaco " we want to a legal answer to the question of whether these publications can simply write what they want , " said a royal spokeswoman .
prinz said there are at least 40 questionable reports about the swedish royals in the last 14 weeks alone , including reports that crown princess victoria had an abortion , and that silvia and carl gustaf were contemplating divorce .

the european union has warned u.s. president george w. bush to remove the 20-month-old tariffs , put in place to protect the ailing american steel industry , or face retaliation , which could include $ 2.2 billion in duties on u.s. goods .
the eu , along with a group of countries including japan , brazil , south korea and switzerland , had filed a complaint with the geneva-based wto complaining that the steel duties were a barrier to free trade .
the united states had argued that the duties , which were initially for up to 30 percent but which were later lowered , were necessary to protect u.s. steel makers from a flood of cheap imports , but a panel of wto judges disagreed .
the 22 countries that filed complaints hailed the decision .
" it leaves the united states with no other choice but to terminate its wto incompatible safeguard measures without delay , " they said in a joint statement . more briefs 07.11.2003 -pipe- consumer advocates sue kellogg germany 07.11.2003 -pipe- deutsche post profits plummet 07.11.2003 -pipe- bmw says new models helping strengthen bottom line 06.11.2003 -pipe- bertelsmann , sony to merge music companies 06.11.2003 -pipe- journalist 's insider trading conviction thrown out 06.11.2003 -pipe- journalist 's insider trading conviction thrown out 05.11.2003 -pipe- german magazine market bouncing back 05.11.2003 -pipe- budget airline easyjet on expansion course in germany 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

christian democratic leaders are standing behind a member of parliament who called jews a " race of perpetrators " despite mounting criticism that they have failed to take adequate disciplinary measures . martin hohmann has been reprimanded by party leadership , he 's been ordered to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee in the german parliament and instead has been moved to the environmental committee .
he 's also been given an ultimatum by his party : cease with the anti-semitic remarks or face expulsion . but that 's about as far as party leadership is willing to go at the moment - out of fear that excluding him could create a huge rift within the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , germany 's leading opposition party . in the members ' forum on the party 's web site , postings include comments critical of the cdu 's failure to expel hohmann .
but there are also those who say that hohmann 's remarks , made in a speech in early october , were taken out of context and that the parliamentarian simply expressed the thoughts of many germans .
an army general who had voiced similar feelings about hohmann 's viewpoints was fired from his job last week . party defends decision to keep hohmann for more than a week now , the cdu 's leadership has been struggling to decide how best to deal with the parliamentarian .
soon after hohmann 's comments became public , party leader angela merkel apparently consider banishing him from the cdu 's parliamentary group , according to the newsmagazine der spiegel . but other party leaders warned merkel that hohmann could no longer be controlled after that .
while condemning hohmann 's remarks , the cdu leadership appears to want to deal with any reprimand of hohmann internally . " we have taken a clear and necessary step but we also consider it to be sufficient , " laurenz meyer , the party 's secretary general , said in a television talk show on sunday , referring to reprimanding hohmann and moving him over to the environmental beat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party leader angela merkel , left , and cdu secretay general laurenz meyer have decided to keep hohmann within the party for the time being .
hohmann 's comments were " unspeakable " and " intolerable , " meyer said .
but , he added , hohmann was definitely not a anti-semite " in the narrow sense " but rather a " fundamentalist in his views on the church . "
besides , expelling hohmann from the party could take years . roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the central german state of hesse , where hohmann is from , defended the party 's decision not to expel the parliamentarian while taking steps to distance himself from hohmann 's anti-semitic remarks .
koch did so during a speech at a frankfurt synagogue , causing more than a quarter of the audience to leave the room . bavarian permier edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , said hohmann 's actions would be closely observed from now on .
" he 's on the strictest kind of probation , " stoiber said .
" one more remark like that and it will be impossible for him to remain within the party . " growing calls to expel hohmann others have instead called upon the cdu to get rid of hohmann .
germany 's social democratic interior minister , otto schily , said he expected the cdu to conclude that " anyone agitating such a brown sauce again " should be expelled from its parliamentary group . jewish leaders expressed similar feelings .
" it 's intolerable , not only for those belonging to a minority , that someone who spreads right extremist ideas has a seat and a voice in the german parliament , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany , said on sunday . even within the cdu , some are starting to say that hohmann will have to go .

christian democratic leaders are standing behind a member of parliament who called jews a " race of perpetrators " despite mounting criticism that they have failed to take adequate disciplinary measures . martin hohmann has been reprimanded by party leadership , he 's been ordered to give up his seat on the influential domestic affairs committee in the german parliament and instead has been moved to the environmental committee .
he 's also been given an ultimatum by his party : cease with the anti-semitic remarks or face expulsion . but that 's about as far as party leadership is willing to go at the moment - out of fear that excluding him could create a huge rift within the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , germany 's leading opposition party . in the members ' forum on the party 's web site , postings include comments critical of the cdu 's failure to expel hohmann .
but there are also those who say that hohmann 's remarks , made in a speech in early october , were taken out of context and that the parliamentarian simply expressed the thoughts of many germans .
an army general who had voiced similar feelings about hohmann 's viewpoints was fired from his job last week . party defends decision to keep hohmann for more than a week now , the cdu 's leadership has been struggling to decide how best to deal with the parliamentarian .
soon after hohmann 's comments became public , party leader angela merkel apparently consider banishing him from the cdu 's parliamentary group , according to the newsmagazine der spiegel . but other party leaders warned merkel that hohmann could no longer be controlled after that .
while condemning hohmann 's remarks , the cdu leadership appears to want to deal with any reprimand of hohmann internally . " we have taken a clear and necessary step but we also consider it to be sufficient , " laurenz meyer , the party 's secretary general , said in a television talk show on sunday , referring to reprimanding hohmann and moving him over to the environmental beat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic party leader angela merkel , left , and cdu secretay general laurenz meyer have decided to keep hohmann within the party for the time being .
hohmann 's comments were " unspeakable " and " intolerable , " meyer said .
but , he added , hohmann was definitely not a anti-semite " in the narrow sense " but rather a " fundamentalist in his views on the church . "
besides , expelling hohmann from the party could take years . roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the central german state of hesse , where hohmann is from , defended the party 's decision not to expel the parliamentarian while taking steps to distance himself from hohmann 's anti-semitic remarks .
koch did so during a speech at a frankfurt synagogue , causing more than a quarter of the audience to leave the room . bavarian permier edmund stoiber , who heads the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , said hohmann 's actions would be closely observed from now on .
" he 's on the strictest kind of probation , " stoiber said .
" one more remark like that and it will be impossible for him to remain within the party . " growing calls to expel hohmann others have instead called upon the cdu to get rid of hohmann .
germany 's social democratic interior minister , otto schily , said he expected the cdu to conclude that " anyone agitating such a brown sauce again " should be expelled from its parliamentary group . jewish leaders expressed similar feelings .
" it 's intolerable , not only for those belonging to a minority , that someone who spreads right extremist ideas has a seat and a voice in the german parliament , " paul spiegel , president of the central council of jews in germany , said on sunday . even within the cdu , some are starting to say that hohmann will have to go .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.11.2003 eu postpones decision on allowing gm foods großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm crops have been the subject of many a demonstration in europe .
after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .
genetically modified foods are popularly referred to as “ franken food ” and consumers say they are extremely wary about buying food products whose genes have been spliced in laboratories .
retailers say they see no reason to offer more gm foods for sale until demand rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers , even those not specifically opposed to biotech crops , are also reluctant to go the biotech route , since sowing land with gm seeds is an economic gamble few are willing to take in the current environment .
others do not trust the science .
“ i ’ m afraid we simply don ’ t have enough information to make the right decision .
i ’ m also concerned that the tests we have so far are not conclusive enough to judge the long-term consequences , ” said carsten fedder , a farmer who chooses to grow a conventional rapeseed crops , even though several gm varieties have built-in insecticides .
proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .
they point to the many advantages modern genetic technology can provide , such as maize varieties which flourish even in the midst of drought or picture-perfect tomatoes that are extremely high in vitamin content .
scientists are even exploring creating foods that contain agents that are helpful in preventing diseases like uterine cancer .
“ we ’ ve basically shown that a potato can produce a vaccine , ” said sophie biemelt , a researcher the institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in gatersleben .
“ one could imagine one day getting vaccines from the food you eat . ”
but such arguments have thus far failed to sway a majority of europeans .
farmer carsten fedder said he prefers the genetics that nature gave his potatoes , or the rye that he also grows .
if he chose to grow the generically modified version of the grain , he would have higher yields , such as american farmers enjoy . still , fedder , whose children influence his views , insists he is not concerned .
“ the market here in europe is large enough , really .
as long as it ’ s protected against genetically modified seeds , our opportunities are good , ” he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no franken food for europe british scientists have published a report indicating that gm crops may damage the environment .
biotech opponents said this confirmed their worst fears , while lobbyists stressed the positive side of such crops .

after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .
genetically modified foods are popularly referred to as “ franken food ” and consumers say they are extremely wary about buying food products whose genes have been spliced in laboratories .
retailers say they see no reason to offer more gm foods for sale until demand rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers , even those not specifically opposed to biotech crops , are also reluctant to go the biotech route , since sowing land with gm seeds is an economic gamble few are willing to take in the current environment .

i ’ m also concerned that the tests we have so far are not conclusive enough to judge the long-term consequences , ” said carsten fedder , a farmer who chooses to grow a conventional rapeseed crops , even though several gm varieties have built-in insecticides .
proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .
they point to the many advantages modern genetic technology can provide , such as maize varieties which flourish even in the midst of drought or picture-perfect tomatoes that are extremely high in vitamin content .
scientists are even exploring creating foods that contain agents that are helpful in preventing diseases like uterine cancer .
“ we ’ ve basically shown that a potato can produce a vaccine , ” said sophie biemelt , a researcher the institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in gatersleben .
“ one could imagine one day getting vaccines from the food you eat . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.11.2003 nazi chemical giant declares bankruptcy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners lined up for a hard labor assignment at auschwitz in poland during world war ii the infamous nazi poison-gas manufacturer ig farben is insolvent , possibly leaving thousands of former forced laborers trying to claim compensation out in the cold . the timing was ironic .
on sunday , germany mourned the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
on monday , i.g. farben , which manufactured the gas that killed nazi concentration camp prisoners , was declared insolvent , more than 50 years after the liquidators started to dissolve the firm .
" there 's no serious basis for continuing the liquidation , " chief liquidators otto bernhardt and volker pollehn said on monday , after saying that they would register ig farben 's insolvency the same day . the two said financial problems on the part of investor wcm , an investment and real estate firm that had agreed to buy ig farben 's real estate holdings , led to the eventual bankruptcy . ig farben 's assets currently make up from € 5- € 10 million . angry protesters the press conference in frankfurt was accompanied by angry protesters .
demonstrators criticized the fact that former forced laborers will have no more recourse to compensation .
although bernhardt and pollehn established a foundation in 1999 to compensate them , it is only endowed with 500,000 deutschmarks -lrb- around € 256,000 or $ 293,000 -rrb- .
more money was supposed to be paid into the foundation eventually , but ig farben 's insolvency will prevent that .
all remaining assets are expected to go to the firm 's creditor banks , and the liquidators said it was unclear whether former forced laborers would receive compensation . forced laborers from western countries received compensation for their trials at ig farben plants in the 1950s , but many of those from eastern europe are still waiting .
ig farben was not involved in the fund established by germany in 2001 to compensate forced laborers . both bernhardt and pollehn and the association of critical shareholders in germany have speculated that the lively trading in ig farben shares on wednesday - just hours before the company announced possibly declaring insolvency - suggested insider trading .
the liquidators said they had not passed on information before the wednesday statement . besides bernhardt and pollehn , only ig farben 's supervisory board and the creditor banks were already aware of the situation , they said . " we believe the creditor banks should waive their claim to the money , " henry mathews , head of the association of critical shareholders , told deutsche welle .
" it is blood money that belongs to the former forced laborers not financial speculators .
the moral claims are undeniable . " intertwined with hitler 's regime ig farben was founded in 1925 .
even before the rise of the nazis in 1933 , the firm , then the world 's largest chemical manufacturer , was closely-affiliated with the national socialists .
it produced zyklon b , the gas that was used to kill prisoners in concentration camps , and exploited more than 80,000 forced laborers in labor and concentration camps . after world war ii , the allies stripped the firm of most of its assets , which were transferred to the three chemical firms bayer , hoechst -lrb- now aventis -rrb- and basf .
since then ig farben 's legal successor has been in the process of being liquidated , while its stocks continue to be traded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , € 1.5 billion have been paid to 817,000 claimants worldwide , a representative told dw-world .

on sunday , germany mourned the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
on monday , i.g. farben , which manufactured the gas that killed nazi concentration camp prisoners , was declared insolvent , more than 50 years after the liquidators started to dissolve the firm .
" there 's no serious basis for continuing the liquidation , " chief liquidators otto bernhardt and volker pollehn said on monday , after saying that they would register ig farben 's insolvency the same day . the two said financial problems on the part of investor wcm , an investment and real estate firm that had agreed to buy ig farben 's real estate holdings , led to the eventual bankruptcy . ig farben 's assets currently make up from € 5- € 10 million . angry protesters the press conference in frankfurt was accompanied by angry protesters .
demonstrators criticized the fact that former forced laborers will have no more recourse to compensation .
although bernhardt and pollehn established a foundation in 1999 to compensate them , it is only endowed with 500,000 deutschmarks -lrb- around € 256,000 or $ 293,000 -rrb- .
more money was supposed to be paid into the foundation eventually , but ig farben 's insolvency will prevent that .
all remaining assets are expected to go to the firm 's creditor banks , and the liquidators said it was unclear whether former forced laborers would receive compensation . forced laborers from western countries received compensation for their trials at ig farben plants in the 1950s , but many of those from eastern europe are still waiting .
ig farben was not involved in the fund established by germany in 2001 to compensate forced laborers . both bernhardt and pollehn and the association of critical shareholders in germany have speculated that the lively trading in ig farben shares on wednesday - just hours before the company announced possibly declaring insolvency - suggested insider trading .
the liquidators said they had not passed on information before the wednesday statement . besides bernhardt and pollehn , only ig farben 's supervisory board and the creditor banks were already aware of the situation , they said . " we believe the creditor banks should waive their claim to the money , " henry mathews , head of the association of critical shareholders , told deutsche welle .
" it is blood money that belongs to the former forced laborers not financial speculators .
the moral claims are undeniable . " intertwined with hitler 's regime ig farben was founded in 1925 .
even before the rise of the nazis in 1933 , the firm , then the world 's largest chemical manufacturer , was closely-affiliated with the national socialists .
it produced zyklon b , the gas that was used to kill prisoners in concentration camps , and exploited more than 80,000 forced laborers in labor and concentration camps . after world war ii , the allies stripped the firm of most of its assets , which were transferred to the three chemical firms bayer , hoechst -lrb- now aventis -rrb- and basf .
since then ig farben 's legal successor has been in the process of being liquidated , while its stocks continue to be traded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , € 1.5 billion have been paid to 817,000 claimants worldwide , a representative told dw-world .

after contentious debate , the european union has put off decision that would allow genetically modified sweetcorn to return to store shelves .
the eu is under pressure to end its ban on gm foods , but consumers are wary . in brussels on monday , environmentalists placed a giant inflatable tomato in front of eu buildings , driving home their message that genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods should have no place on european store shelves or in farmers ’ fields .
that message got through to members of a committee studying the possibility of allowing biotech crops into the eu , who decided more time was needed before making a decision on authorizing the import of a genetically modified sweetcorn .
the committee postponed the decision until december .
“ a fierce discussion took place today , ” said european commission spokesman reijo kemppinen , who briefed reporters about the debate that took place in an eu specialist committee set up to examine giving the green light to gm foods and crops .
the debate was over whether to allow bt-11 maize , marketed by the swiss agrochemicals company syngenta , to be imported into the eu as a food product to be eaten from the can .
while a dossier laying out the pros and cons of importing the maize into europe has been ready for months , the eu ’ s executive commission had been waiting for monday ’ s debate to see where member countries fall on the issue and to gauge the public mood concerning the issue .
the mood does not seem to be improving .
surveys show 70 percent of europeans oppose gm foods and crops .
five-year ban an unofficial ban has been in place since 1998 , when the eu approved its last batch of gm food products .
the next year , france and germany led calls for a de facto moratorium on new gm food approval and won the backing of several other eu states .
they formed a minority block that has been able to block any vote on a new approval .
but the eu is under pressure from other trading partners , including the united states , canada and argentina , to drop the ban .
the u.s. filed a complaint with the wto this year , saying the moratorium is illegal and without any scientific foundation .
farmers in the u.s. say it costs them millions of dollars a year in lost sales .
for the planned december vote , the european commission will need a qualified majority of members states to approve or reject the bt-11 maize .
a ‘ yes ’ vote next month would put an end to the unofficial blockade and clear the way for a variety of new gm products .
france is seen as playing a crucial vote , since paris was part of the most vocal anti-gm campaigners .
however , it has been softening is opposition to biotech food over the past several months .
strong opposition but opposition to gm crops among european consumers continues to run high .
genetically modified foods are popularly referred to as “ franken food ” and consumers say they are extremely wary about buying food products whose genes have been spliced in laboratories .
retailers say they see no reason to offer more gm foods for sale until demand rises .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers , even those not specifically opposed to biotech crops , are also reluctant to go the biotech route , since sowing land with gm seeds is an economic gamble few are willing to take in the current environment .
others do not trust the science .
“ i ’ m afraid we simply don ’ t have enough information to make the right decision .
i ’ m also concerned that the tests we have so far are not conclusive enough to judge the long-term consequences , ” said carsten fedder , a farmer who chooses to grow a conventional rapeseed crops , even though several gm varieties have built-in insecticides .
proponents of gm foods say the fear among consumers is unfounded , since other countries , namely the u.s. , have been growing and eating biotech crops for years .
they point to the many advantages modern genetic technology can provide , such as maize varieties which flourish even in the midst of drought or picture-perfect tomatoes that are extremely high in vitamin content .
scientists are even exploring creating foods that contain agents that are helpful in preventing diseases like uterine cancer .
“ we ’ ve basically shown that a potato can produce a vaccine , ” said sophie biemelt , a researcher the institute of plant genetics and crop plant research in gatersleben .
“ one could imagine one day getting vaccines from the food you eat . ”
but such arguments have thus far failed to sway a majority of europeans .
farmer carsten fedder said he prefers the genetics that nature gave his potatoes , or the rye that he also grows .
if he chose to grow the generically modified version of the grain , he would have higher yields , such as american farmers enjoy . still , fedder , whose children influence his views , insists he is not concerned .

princess caroline of monaco has taken her fight against german tabloids to the european court for human rights in strasbourg .
she 's asking for europe-wide regulations on the paparazzi . germany 's claim to monaco royality , princess caroline , has taken a decade-long privacy dispute with the german tabloids to the european court typically charged with handling major human rights issues .
the wife of ernst august prince of hannover first filed suit against several german tabloids in 1993 , after they published paparazzi photos of her riding , shopping and sunbathing were published in several german celebrity magazines .
after germany 's consitutional court sidestepped the case in 1999 , caroline 's lawyers took it to european court for human rights , arguing that the photos are a violation of article 8 of the european human rights convention , which give her the right to protection of her private and family life .
caroline 's lawyer matthias prinz said his client wants europe-wide regulations such as those in france , where prominent people may only be photographed while carrying out public duties , unless otherwise agreed on .
prinz said that as long as the german press is allowed to publish paparazzi-style photos taken abroad , laws such as those in france are meaningless .
" paparazzi are manhunters , authorized by the german legal system , " said prinz at a hearing last thursday .
german law at issue the court normally hears cases of purportedly weightier issues , such as the recent trial of the kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
now , it 's being asked to decide on whether or not german law sufficiently protects the right to privacy .
referring to the court 's more typical case load , prinz said his client was essentially being tortured by the paparazzi .
" there ’ s the torture of isolation , and there ’ s the torture that comes of having your every move followed by the paparazzi and never for a second being sure that you ’ re truly alone , " prinz said , flanked by some of the offending photos which he had blown up and mounted on boards as evidence for the court .
his client is not attending the hearing , he said , because that would have only attracted more photographers .
reader 's rights are at stake but the german association of magazine publishers argues that if caroline gets her way , the press would be degraded to the function of mere court reporters .
germany ’ s constitutional court largely agreed , dimissing her claim with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children .
prinz emphasised that caroline ’ s children are constantly being followed , and that photographers frequently stake out their schools .
his client , he said , has no official function in monaco , she is simply " her father ’ s daughter , " and therefore has the right to a private life .
but in germany , he said , the interests of the tabloid press seem to take priority .
robert schweizer , a board member of the burda verlag , which publishes several german celebrity magazines , said the hearing in strasbourg is not about the rights of the publishers , but rather the rights of millions of readers .
for them , caroline of monaco is a " role model , " he said , which is why they have a justifiable interest in information about her life .
public interest in germany about caroline 's life increased with her marriage to prince ernst august of hannover .
german press under fire the german tabloid press has been under seige as of late .
sweden 's queen silvia and king carl xvi gustaf have hired prinz to prepare a lawsuit against several publications for printing what they allege are made-up stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caroline von monaco " we want to a legal answer to the question of whether these publications can simply write what they want , " said a royal spokeswoman .
prinz said there are at least 40 questionable reports about the swedish royals in the last 14 weeks alone , including reports that crown princess victoria had an abortion , and that silvia and carl gustaf were contemplating divorce .
they have the support of norway ’ s monarchs , who have publicly criticised the german press for making up stories about crown prince haakon , his wife , princess mette-marit , as well as other members of the norwegian royal family . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

considerable discussion " that would be the ideal move from here , that we would make it so clear to lloyds tsb that it was not worth going through the closure in terms of the impact on the staff and critically on customers and their response would be that they would decide not to close it . "

residents are being asked to call crimestoppers with any information they have on people who may be dealing in class a drugs .

organisers say they hope to encourage people with information about dealers in class a drugs , such as heroin , cocaine and crack cocaine , to get in contact anonymously .
police would then be able to use this information to disrupt drug markets and stifle the supply of illegal substances , making the whole community safer .
rat on a rat is being funded by the government office south west 's excellence and innovation programme .
the campaign follows the success of a similar scheme which was carried out in plymouth .

researchers at the university of st andrews are developing methods to measure the effects of chemicals called phyto-oestrogens on humans .
the plant hormones , similar to the female sex hormone oestrogen , are found most commonly in soya beans and other high-fibre foods .
previous research has found women with high levels of phyto-oestrogens in their bodies are less susceptible to cancer .
this is a major breakthrough we are leading and is a massive step forward dr margaret ritchie university of st andrews this is partly due to the effect they have on lowering natural production of oestrogen , high levels of which have been linked to breast cancer .
recent research has reported that breast cancer is less prevalent in asian women , who have a high-fibre diet .
the work by st andrews-based researcher , dr margaret ritchie , has been described as " exceptionally important " and " invaluable " by independent academics dr ritchie has spent the last three years constructing and validating a database of foods which contain phyto-oestrogens .
research tool " so far , nobody in the world can accurately monitor human exposure to phyto-oestrogens , or how people respond to such exposure , " she said .
" this is a major breakthrough we are leading and is a massive step forward . "
professor john cummings , from the university of dundee , has helped dr ritchie identify several suitable biomarkers to give a reliable biochemical snapshot of human exposure .
phyto-oestragens found in about 300 foods high concentrations in fruit , vegetables , sunflower seeds , sesame seeds , rye and especially soya beans potential anti-oxidant and anti-cancer properties claimed to help prevent prostate cancer and alleviate the symptoms of the menopause " it was a case of going back to basics .
it 's amazing that no-one has developed a biomarker of phyto-oestrogen exposure before , " said dr ritchie .
her database will assist researchers in painting a clearer picture of the use and effects which could aid the future prevention of breast cancer or assist in its treatment .
the database will be made available on the university of st andrews website and is already being used in an edinburgh-based prostate cancer study .
dr ritchie studied almost 90 volunteers from all over scotland , enlisting healthy , cancer-free women aged between 18 and 81 , who each kept a food diary for up to six months .
they returned their food diaries and diets and supplied her with over 500 blood , urine and diet samples so that she could measure exposure to phyto-oestrogens .
some men were included in the research to prove the biomarkers were reliable regardless of gender .

the decline has been blamed on extensive irrigation activities along the lake by large flower plantations operating within the area .
the lake naivasha area is home to more that 30 flower farms that export their produce to the lucrative european markets .
electric pumps at the flower farms are used to draw thousands of litres of water from lake naivasha to irrigate the massive farms .
but the extensive irrigation is slowly threatening the lake 's existence - residents along the shores confirm that water levels have been steadily falling .
" in 1975 it was about one kilometre from here ... inside the land ... the lake is endangered now , " said joseph gakunga , a small-scale farmer who depends on the lake for irrigation .
fish population more than 100 fishermen - like stanley mungai who has been fishing the lake for the past 30 years - depend on lake naivasha for their livelihood and they too fear that their source of income is threatened .
the farms export flowers to europe he says great changes have occurred here - in the past there was plenty of fish in the lake but today the fishermen struggle to get a good catch due to over-exploitation of the lake .
mr mungai observes that those using pumps to draw water have been drawing small fish through their powerful pumps , which has in turn reduced the fish population in lake naivasha .
but is it true that irrigation activities along the lake are to blame for the declining levels ?
" whenever people are involved in agriculture they withdraw water ... if what they are removing collectively is more than what is coming in then there is an imbalance , " says dr bancy mati , a researcher on water issues in kenya raise awareness in response to claims that irrigation activities by flower farms are to blame for the declining water levels , some of the farms in naivasha have launched activities aimed at conserving the lake .
they have adopted new technologies to ensure that very little water is used at the farms .
" everything is contained . the water for irrigation is contained in a closed container , so we try to be as efficient as we could with water usage ... the entire farm is on trickle irrigation , " said the technical manager at oserian plantations , james kelamanfon .
the residents too have intensified efforts to conserve the lake - they have now formed lake naivasha management committee whose chairman is andrew enniskillen .
" what we have tried to do is raise awareness on the part of all our members who are very diverse , " said mr enniskillen .
" but the problem that i struggle with is that the more environmentally friendly we are in our behaviour around the lake , the less competitive advantage we have " .
despite the visible threat , most residents believe that proactive measures are crucial if they are to save lake naivasha - their sole water source .

plain clothed officers from the department of transport are understood to have managed to pass devices through the airport 's x-ray machines and take them into the cabin of an airplane .
a spokesman for the transport department said it was within its rights to carry out such tests at any time , but would not confirm if this specific incident took place .
baa , which owns edinburgh airport , would not comment on the details either , but said security is given the highest priority at all times .
a scottish newspaper described the objects as " bomb-like " and reports that the devices had been hidden inside a laptop computer and a hairdryer before being put into luggage for the test last month .
edinburgh , which handles almost seven million passengers a year , is part of the british airports authority , which also runs glasgow , aberdeen , heathrow , gatwick , stansted and southampton . "
since september 11 , 2001 , baa has confiscated nearly 13 million items which are not permitted on board aircraft " baa edinburgh airport bosses promised to tighten security four years ago after explosives , guns and knives were carried undetected through checkpoints in a similar operation by transport department staff .
a spokesman for baa in scotland said security at all uk terminals was tested " regularly and rigorously " , using constantly updated methods , with the support of the industry .
" test results are only one of many control measures used to improve and enhance security systems across the airport , " he added .
" airport security is more than metal detectors and personal searches .
there are many layers , including 100 % hold baggage screening , and close cooperation with the police and control authorities to identify specific threats .
" we never comment on specific details of security processes other than to say that this area is given the highest priority at all times .
" since september 11 , 2001 , baa has confiscated nearly 13 million items which are not permitted on board aircraft . "
