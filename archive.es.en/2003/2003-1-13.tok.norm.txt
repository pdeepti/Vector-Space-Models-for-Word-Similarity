statesmen from both countries hope the deal will revitalize a once tight relationship that has been lacklustre in recent years . among the most revolutionary proposals is that of encouraging french and german ministers to take part in each other 's cabinet meetings .
as foreseen under draft versions of the plan , ministers would then attempt to enact identical legislation in areas such as civil and family law and education standards . the guardian newspaper of london reported that draft versions of the declaration also called for the appointment of a top official responsible for promoting cooperation between the two countries . elysee contract signed by de gaulle and adenauer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer and charles de gaulle the declaration being discussed is the result of nearly a dozen franco-german summits over the past year and is timed for release on jan .

germany has repeatedly said it will not participate in a possible war against iraq , while france has hinted that it might be willing to contribute troops to a u.s.-led invation . " iraq will be the acid test for the claim that we want to cultivate special relations between the two countries , " rudolf von thadden , coordinator of franco-german relations in the german foreign ministry , told the handelsblatt newspaper . quick test of friendship pact foreseen if adopted on jan .
22 , the declaration of cooperation would be put to the test quickly after u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq report on the situation on jan .
27 . " the declaration would be rendered meaningless if a week later paris stood shoulder to shoulder with the victorious allies of 1945 and not with their most important partner in respect to seeking a common european position , " von thadden said . earlier this month , germany began a two-year stint on the u.n. security council , while france is a permanent member . while the franco-german cooperation pact is still in the works , british leaders are already on the alert .
the guardian called the initiative " the latest , and most striking , evidence of a campaign by the two countries to give renewed momentum to their special relationship , for years the driving force behind european integration . " german-french cooperation on european policy last year , the french and germans ended a long-standing dispute about european agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the european union 's overall budget and subsidizes french farmers to the tune of billions .
and just prior to last year 's copenhagen summit , the two countries aligned their policies on turkey 's request to join the european union . if all goes as planned , the german and french parliaments will hold their first-ever joint meeting on jan .
22 . as a gesture of friendship , the french hosts at versailles plan a festive dinner at which german white wine and french red wine will be served for toasting the successes of the past 10 years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe still divided over iraq european leaders are still wringing their hands over a common policy towards iraq against a backdrop of mass demonstrations against military force and diplomatic tension at the security council .

but plans to display the works in switzerland failed following sharp protests . the friedrich-christian flick collection is one of the world 's biggest private holdings of contemporary art .
from 2004 onward , the over 2,000 work collection will be shown in its entirety in berlin for the first time ever .
the decision came after months of negotiations between flick and the stiftung preussischer kulturbesitz , the administrative body that runs berlin 's state museums .
the move follows a failed effort to exhibit the collection in zurich .
the jewish community and cultural organizations had blocked flick ’ s plans to build a special museum for his collection in zurich designed by star dutch architect rem koolhaas .
critics opposed the exhibit because much of the collection was purchased with the fortune amassed by the flicks under the nazis .
facing the past flick 's grandfather , friedrich flick , was one of adolf hitler 's largest arms manufacturers and helped fuel nazi germany 's war machine .
following world war ii , he was sentenced to seven years in prison for crimes including the use of slave labor in his factories and cooperating with the nazis .
he was pardoned in 1950 .
friedrich-christian flick has also been criticized for refusing to contribute to the fund set up by german industry and the federal government to compensate those forced to work for the nazis .
but the wealthy collector has said he does n't see how he can be guilty of something which he did n't do .
instead , flick has referred to his " foundation against xenophobia , racism and intolerance . "
at a press conference on thursday announcing the deal , flick stressed that he was not avoiding the criticism of his family history .
he said he had faced up to it .
this past was one of the reasons he acquired critical works , such as those by bruce nauman , for his collection , flick said .
taking art hostage berlin 's culture minister , christina weiss , said she understood that flick had to " put up with " questions regarding his family 's past .
but she added that she did n't understand how a tie could be made between the nazi era and a collection of contemporary art .
" how can one attempt to take art hostage and condemn it to disrespect ? "
weiss asked the assembled journalists .
neither the artists nor their works deserved this , she said .
the friedrich-christian flick collection includes works by some 150 artists , including bruce nauman , marcel duchamp , piet mondrian , kurt schwitters , gerhard richter , sigmar polke , richard serra , on kawara und nam june paik .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .
struck thinks the military should be given more flexibility to deal with domestic threats . “ we won ’ t be able to get around amending the constitution , ” struck told the news magazine der spiegel .
the social democrat has commissioned a working group to examine the bundeswehr ’ s legal basis for dealing with domestic threats , according to the newsweekly . limits of the law currently , germany 's constitution only permits the bundeswehr to conduct missions domestically in cases where the country faces the threat of invasion or when natural catastrophes or large accidents occur .
the military is also prohibited from assuming police-like functions , like running crowd control at public demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although two military sharpshooters were prepared to shoot down the hijacked glider , for example , the defense minister was unable to give them permission .
meanwhile , the frankfurt incident has kindled a spirited debate on the domestic role of the military in a country where memories of world war ii still linger . friends and foes angela merkel , who heads the parliamentary group of the oppositional christian democractic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , described struck ’ s comments as an interesting development .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , both support the passage of a constitutional amendment to modernize the country ’ s domestic security policies , merkel told reuters . her colleague , wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu / csu parliamentary group , declared an amendment necessary to deal with the changing threats to germany ’ s security .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schäuble maintained that only the bundeswehr could protect germany from the dangers that airplanes could present . meanwhile , leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and oppositional free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- disagree with the defense minister 's new direction .
the spd 's parliamentary group spokesman for domestic policy , dieter wiefelspütz , called a constitutional amendment superfluous .
“ in article 35 , the constitution allows the armed forces to operate against terrorist attacks within the country when the police ’ s resources alone are insufficient , ” wiefelspütz wrote in the saarbrücker zeitung newspaper . the fdp 's parliamentary group leader , jörg van essen , stressed that the bundeswehr has policed german air space since the air force was first constituted and as such already has a legal basis for acting in cases like the frankfurt hijacking . the chairman of the german police ’ s union , konrad freiberg , also voiced his opposition to a constitutional amendment over the weekend .
freiberg said he believes the bundeswehr already had a legal basis for acting against strambach .
not only would a change to the constitution be unnecessary , but in the context of a “ pending iraq war , such a suggestion is a political powder keg , ” he said . with fears of a terror attack in germany running high with the arrest of two alleged high-ranking al qaida members in frankfurt and trials continuing in two cases involving suspected terrorists in hamburg and frankfurt , the issue is likely to smolder for months to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german air security debate remains grounded german officials prepare to tighten air security across the country in the wake of a recent frankfurt hijack .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .
struck thinks the military should be given more flexibility to deal with domestic threats . “ we won ’ t be able to get around amending the constitution , ” struck told the news magazine der spiegel .
the social democrat has commissioned a working group to examine the bundeswehr ’ s legal basis for dealing with domestic threats , according to the newsweekly . limits of the law currently , germany 's constitution only permits the bundeswehr to conduct missions domestically in cases where the country faces the threat of invasion or when natural catastrophes or large accidents occur .
the military is also prohibited from assuming police-like functions , like running crowd control at public demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although two military sharpshooters were prepared to shoot down the hijacked glider , for example , the defense minister was unable to give them permission .

the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , both support the passage of a constitutional amendment to modernize the country ’ s domestic security policies , merkel told reuters . her colleague , wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu / csu parliamentary group , declared an amendment necessary to deal with the changing threats to germany ’ s security .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schäuble maintained that only the bundeswehr could protect germany from the dangers that airplanes could present . meanwhile , leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and oppositional free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- disagree with the defense minister 's new direction .
the spd 's parliamentary group spokesman for domestic policy , dieter wiefelspütz , called a constitutional amendment superfluous .
“ in article 35 , the constitution allows the armed forces to operate against terrorist attacks within the country when the police ’ s resources alone are insufficient , ” wiefelspütz wrote in the saarbrücker zeitung newspaper . the fdp 's parliamentary group leader , jörg van essen , stressed that the bundeswehr has policed german air space since the air force was first constituted and as such already has a legal basis for acting in cases like the frankfurt hijacking . the chairman of the german police ’ s union , konrad freiberg , also voiced his opposition to a constitutional amendment over the weekend .

but plans to display the works in switzerland failed following sharp protests . the friedrich-christian flick collection is one of the world 's biggest private holdings of contemporary art .
from 2004 onward , the over 2,000 work collection will be shown in its entirety in berlin for the first time ever .
the decision came after months of negotiations between flick and the stiftung preussischer kulturbesitz , the administrative body that runs berlin 's state museums .
the move follows a failed effort to exhibit the collection in zurich .
the jewish community and cultural organizations had blocked flick ’ s plans to build a special museum for his collection in zurich designed by star dutch architect rem koolhaas .
critics opposed the exhibit because much of the collection was purchased with the fortune amassed by the flicks under the nazis .
facing the past flick 's grandfather , friedrich flick , was one of adolf hitler 's largest arms manufacturers and helped fuel nazi germany 's war machine .
following world war ii , he was sentenced to seven years in prison for crimes including the use of slave labor in his factories and cooperating with the nazis .
he was pardoned in 1950 .
friedrich-christian flick has also been criticized for refusing to contribute to the fund set up by german industry and the federal government to compensate those forced to work for the nazis .
but the wealthy collector has said he does n't see how he can be guilty of something which he did n't do .
instead , flick has referred to his " foundation against xenophobia , racism and intolerance . "
at a press conference on thursday announcing the deal , flick stressed that he was not avoiding the criticism of his family history .
he said he had faced up to it .
this past was one of the reasons he acquired critical works , such as those by bruce nauman , for his collection , flick said .
taking art hostage berlin 's culture minister , christina weiss , said she understood that flick had to " put up with " questions regarding his family 's past .
but she added that she did n't understand how a tie could be made between the nazi era and a collection of contemporary art .
" how can one attempt to take art hostage and condemn it to disrespect ? "
weiss asked the assembled journalists .
neither the artists nor their works deserved this , she said .
the friedrich-christian flick collection includes works by some 150 artists , including bruce nauman , marcel duchamp , piet mondrian , kurt schwitters , gerhard richter , sigmar polke , richard serra , on kawara und nam june paik .
the collection will be displayed at the rieck-halle gallery next to berlin 's hamburger bahnhof museum for contemporary art for an initial period of seven years .
flick will finance the elaborate modifications necessary to the building . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

statesmen from both countries hope the deal will revitalize a once tight relationship that has been lacklustre in recent years . among the most revolutionary proposals is that of encouraging french and german ministers to take part in each other 's cabinet meetings .
as foreseen under draft versions of the plan , ministers would then attempt to enact identical legislation in areas such as civil and family law and education standards . the guardian newspaper of london reported that draft versions of the declaration also called for the appointment of a top official responsible for promoting cooperation between the two countries . elysee contract signed by de gaulle and adenauer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer and charles de gaulle the declaration being discussed is the result of nearly a dozen franco-german summits over the past year and is timed for release on jan .

germany has repeatedly said it will not participate in a possible war against iraq , while france has hinted that it might be willing to contribute troops to a u.s.-led invation . " iraq will be the acid test for the claim that we want to cultivate special relations between the two countries , " rudolf von thadden , coordinator of franco-german relations in the german foreign ministry , told the handelsblatt newspaper . quick test of friendship pact foreseen if adopted on jan .
22 , the declaration of cooperation would be put to the test quickly after u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq report on the situation on jan .
27 . " the declaration would be rendered meaningless if a week later paris stood shoulder to shoulder with the victorious allies of 1945 and not with their most important partner in respect to seeking a common european position , " von thadden said . earlier this month , germany began a two-year stint on the u.n. security council , while france is a permanent member . while the franco-german cooperation pact is still in the works , british leaders are already on the alert .
the guardian called the initiative " the latest , and most striking , evidence of a campaign by the two countries to give renewed momentum to their special relationship , for years the driving force behind european integration . " german-french cooperation on european policy last year , the french and germans ended a long-standing dispute about european agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the european union 's overall budget and subsidizes french farmers to the tune of billions .
and just prior to last year 's copenhagen summit , the two countries aligned their policies on turkey 's request to join the european union . if all goes as planned , the german and french parliaments will hold their first-ever joint meeting on jan .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .
struck thinks the military should be given more flexibility to deal with domestic threats . “ we won ’ t be able to get around amending the constitution , ” struck told the news magazine der spiegel .
the social democrat has commissioned a working group to examine the bundeswehr ’ s legal basis for dealing with domestic threats , according to the newsweekly . limits of the law currently , germany 's constitution only permits the bundeswehr to conduct missions domestically in cases where the country faces the threat of invasion or when natural catastrophes or large accidents occur .
the military is also prohibited from assuming police-like functions , like running crowd control at public demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although two military sharpshooters were prepared to shoot down the hijacked glider , for example , the defense minister was unable to give them permission .
meanwhile , the frankfurt incident has kindled a spirited debate on the domestic role of the military in a country where memories of world war ii still linger . friends and foes angela merkel , who heads the parliamentary group of the oppositional christian democractic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , described struck ’ s comments as an interesting development .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , both support the passage of a constitutional amendment to modernize the country ’ s domestic security policies , merkel told reuters . her colleague , wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu / csu parliamentary group , declared an amendment necessary to deal with the changing threats to germany ’ s security .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schäuble maintained that only the bundeswehr could protect germany from the dangers that airplanes could present . meanwhile , leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and oppositional free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- disagree with the defense minister 's new direction .
the spd 's parliamentary group spokesman for domestic policy , dieter wiefelspütz , called a constitutional amendment superfluous .
“ in article 35 , the constitution allows the armed forces to operate against terrorist attacks within the country when the police ’ s resources alone are insufficient , ” wiefelspütz wrote in the saarbrücker zeitung newspaper . the fdp 's parliamentary group leader , jörg van essen , stressed that the bundeswehr has policed german air space since the air force was first constituted and as such already has a legal basis for acting in cases like the frankfurt hijacking . the chairman of the german police ’ s union , konrad freiberg , also voiced his opposition to a constitutional amendment over the weekend .
freiberg said he believes the bundeswehr already had a legal basis for acting against strambach .
not only would a change to the constitution be unnecessary , but in the context of a “ pending iraq war , such a suggestion is a political powder keg , ” he said . with fears of a terror attack in germany running high with the arrest of two alleged high-ranking al qaida members in frankfurt and trials continuing in two cases involving suspected terrorists in hamburg and frankfurt , the issue is likely to smolder for months to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german air security debate remains grounded german officials prepare to tighten air security across the country in the wake of a recent frankfurt hijack .

statesmen from both countries hope the deal will revitalize a once tight relationship that has been lacklustre in recent years . among the most revolutionary proposals is that of encouraging french and german ministers to take part in each other 's cabinet meetings .
as foreseen under draft versions of the plan , ministers would then attempt to enact identical legislation in areas such as civil and family law and education standards . the guardian newspaper of london reported that draft versions of the declaration also called for the appointment of a top official responsible for promoting cooperation between the two countries . elysee contract signed by de gaulle and adenauer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer and charles de gaulle the declaration being discussed is the result of nearly a dozen franco-german summits over the past year and is timed for release on jan .

germany has repeatedly said it will not participate in a possible war against iraq , while france has hinted that it might be willing to contribute troops to a u.s.-led invation . " iraq will be the acid test for the claim that we want to cultivate special relations between the two countries , " rudolf von thadden , coordinator of franco-german relations in the german foreign ministry , told the handelsblatt newspaper . quick test of friendship pact foreseen if adopted on jan .
22 , the declaration of cooperation would be put to the test quickly after u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq report on the situation on jan .
27 . " the declaration would be rendered meaningless if a week later paris stood shoulder to shoulder with the victorious allies of 1945 and not with their most important partner in respect to seeking a common european position , " von thadden said . earlier this month , germany began a two-year stint on the u.n. security council , while france is a permanent member . while the franco-german cooperation pact is still in the works , british leaders are already on the alert .
the guardian called the initiative " the latest , and most striking , evidence of a campaign by the two countries to give renewed momentum to their special relationship , for years the driving force behind european integration . " german-french cooperation on european policy last year , the french and germans ended a long-standing dispute about european agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the european union 's overall budget and subsidizes french farmers to the tune of billions .
and just prior to last year 's copenhagen summit , the two countries aligned their policies on turkey 's request to join the european union . if all goes as planned , the german and french parliaments will hold their first-ever joint meeting on jan .
22 . as a gesture of friendship , the french hosts at versailles plan a festive dinner at which german white wine and french red wine will be served for toasting the successes of the past 10 years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe still divided over iraq european leaders are still wringing their hands over a common policy towards iraq against a backdrop of mass demonstrations against military force and diplomatic tension at the security council .

" the declaration would be rendered meaningless if a week later paris stood shoulder to shoulder with the victorious allies of 1945 and not with their most important partner in respect to seeking a common european position , " von thadden said . earlier this month , germany began a two-year stint on the u.n. security council , while france is a permanent member . while the franco-german cooperation pact is still in the works , british leaders are already on the alert .
the guardian called the initiative " the latest , and most striking , evidence of a campaign by the two countries to give renewed momentum to their special relationship , for years the driving force behind european integration . " german-french cooperation on european policy last year , the french and germans ended a long-standing dispute about european agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the european union 's overall budget and subsidizes french farmers to the tune of billions .
and just prior to last year 's copenhagen summit , the two countries aligned their policies on turkey 's request to join the european union . if all goes as planned , the german and french parliaments will hold their first-ever joint meeting on jan .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .
struck thinks the military should be given more flexibility to deal with domestic threats . “ we won ’ t be able to get around amending the constitution , ” struck told the news magazine der spiegel .
the social democrat has commissioned a working group to examine the bundeswehr ’ s legal basis for dealing with domestic threats , according to the newsweekly . limits of the law currently , germany 's constitution only permits the bundeswehr to conduct missions domestically in cases where the country faces the threat of invasion or when natural catastrophes or large accidents occur .

in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schäuble maintained that only the bundeswehr could protect germany from the dangers that airplanes could present . meanwhile , leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and oppositional free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- disagree with the defense minister 's new direction .
the spd 's parliamentary group spokesman for domestic policy , dieter wiefelspütz , called a constitutional amendment superfluous .
“ in article 35 , the constitution allows the armed forces to operate against terrorist attacks within the country when the police ’ s resources alone are insufficient , ” wiefelspütz wrote in the saarbrücker zeitung newspaper . the fdp 's parliamentary group leader , jörg van essen , stressed that the bundeswehr has policed german air space since the air force was first constituted and as such already has a legal basis for acting in cases like the frankfurt hijacking . the chairman of the german police ’ s union , konrad freiberg , also voiced his opposition to a constitutional amendment over the weekend .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .
struck thinks the military should be given more flexibility to deal with domestic threats . “ we won ’ t be able to get around amending the constitution , ” struck told the news magazine der spiegel .
the social democrat has commissioned a working group to examine the bundeswehr ’ s legal basis for dealing with domestic threats , according to the newsweekly . limits of the law currently , germany 's constitution only permits the bundeswehr to conduct missions domestically in cases where the country faces the threat of invasion or when natural catastrophes or large accidents occur .
the military is also prohibited from assuming police-like functions , like running crowd control at public demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although two military sharpshooters were prepared to shoot down the hijacked glider , for example , the defense minister was unable to give them permission .
meanwhile , the frankfurt incident has kindled a spirited debate on the domestic role of the military in a country where memories of world war ii still linger . friends and foes angela merkel , who heads the parliamentary group of the oppositional christian democractic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , described struck ’ s comments as an interesting development .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , both support the passage of a constitutional amendment to modernize the country ’ s domestic security policies , merkel told reuters . her colleague , wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu / csu parliamentary group , declared an amendment necessary to deal with the changing threats to germany ’ s security .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schäuble maintained that only the bundeswehr could protect germany from the dangers that airplanes could present . meanwhile , leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and oppositional free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- disagree with the defense minister 's new direction .

but plans to display the works in switzerland failed following sharp protests . the friedrich-christian flick collection is one of the world 's biggest private holdings of contemporary art .
from 2004 onward , the over 2,000 work collection will be shown in its entirety in berlin for the first time ever .
the decision came after months of negotiations between flick and the stiftung preussischer kulturbesitz , the administrative body that runs berlin 's state museums .
the move follows a failed effort to exhibit the collection in zurich .
the jewish community and cultural organizations had blocked flick ’ s plans to build a special museum for his collection in zurich designed by star dutch architect rem koolhaas .
critics opposed the exhibit because much of the collection was purchased with the fortune amassed by the flicks under the nazis .
facing the past flick 's grandfather , friedrich flick , was one of adolf hitler 's largest arms manufacturers and helped fuel nazi germany 's war machine .
following world war ii , he was sentenced to seven years in prison for crimes including the use of slave labor in his factories and cooperating with the nazis .
he was pardoned in 1950 .
friedrich-christian flick has also been criticized for refusing to contribute to the fund set up by german industry and the federal government to compensate those forced to work for the nazis .
but the wealthy collector has said he does n't see how he can be guilty of something which he did n't do .
instead , flick has referred to his " foundation against xenophobia , racism and intolerance . "
at a press conference on thursday announcing the deal , flick stressed that he was not avoiding the criticism of his family history .
he said he had faced up to it .
this past was one of the reasons he acquired critical works , such as those by bruce nauman , for his collection , flick said .
taking art hostage berlin 's culture minister , christina weiss , said she understood that flick had to " put up with " questions regarding his family 's past .
but she added that she did n't understand how a tie could be made between the nazi era and a collection of contemporary art .
" how can one attempt to take art hostage and condemn it to disrespect ? "
weiss asked the assembled journalists .
neither the artists nor their works deserved this , she said .
the friedrich-christian flick collection includes works by some 150 artists , including bruce nauman , marcel duchamp , piet mondrian , kurt schwitters , gerhard richter , sigmar polke , richard serra , on kawara und nam june paik .
the collection will be displayed at the rieck-halle gallery next to berlin 's hamburger bahnhof museum for contemporary art for an initial period of seven years .
flick will finance the elaborate modifications necessary to the building . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

but plans to display the works in switzerland failed following sharp protests . the friedrich-christian flick collection is one of the world 's biggest private holdings of contemporary art .
from 2004 onward , the over 2,000 work collection will be shown in its entirety in berlin for the first time ever .
the decision came after months of negotiations between flick and the stiftung preussischer kulturbesitz , the administrative body that runs berlin 's state museums .
the move follows a failed effort to exhibit the collection in zurich .
the jewish community and cultural organizations had blocked flick ’ s plans to build a special museum for his collection in zurich designed by star dutch architect rem koolhaas .
critics opposed the exhibit because much of the collection was purchased with the fortune amassed by the flicks under the nazis .
facing the past flick 's grandfather , friedrich flick , was one of adolf hitler 's largest arms manufacturers and helped fuel nazi germany 's war machine .
following world war ii , he was sentenced to seven years in prison for crimes including the use of slave labor in his factories and cooperating with the nazis .
he was pardoned in 1950 .
friedrich-christian flick has also been criticized for refusing to contribute to the fund set up by german industry and the federal government to compensate those forced to work for the nazis .
but the wealthy collector has said he does n't see how he can be guilty of something which he did n't do .
instead , flick has referred to his " foundation against xenophobia , racism and intolerance . "
at a press conference on thursday announcing the deal , flick stressed that he was not avoiding the criticism of his family history .
he said he had faced up to it .
this past was one of the reasons he acquired critical works , such as those by bruce nauman , for his collection , flick said .
taking art hostage berlin 's culture minister , christina weiss , said she understood that flick had to " put up with " questions regarding his family 's past .
but she added that she did n't understand how a tie could be made between the nazi era and a collection of contemporary art .
" how can one attempt to take art hostage and condemn it to disrespect ? "
weiss asked the assembled journalists .
neither the artists nor their works deserved this , she said .
the friedrich-christian flick collection includes works by some 150 artists , including bruce nauman , marcel duchamp , piet mondrian , kurt schwitters , gerhard richter , sigmar polke , richard serra , on kawara und nam june paik .
the collection will be displayed at the rieck-halle gallery next to berlin 's hamburger bahnhof museum for contemporary art for an initial period of seven years .
flick will finance the elaborate modifications necessary to the building . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live kick off !

and it looks like german films will be among those vying for the coveted golden bear award . with just under a month to go , the names of nominees are beginning to filter through for the critics prize at the 53rd berlin international film festival which begins on february 6th .
the names of 19 films from europe , asia , the united states and africa have been confirmed for the main " competition " program of the festival with germany offering strong contenders for the coveted golden bear award for best film .
the new film from oscar winning director steven soderburgh and the much-anticipated return to form of martin scorsese will adorn the festival which will run from the 6th to the 16th but it is expected to be the resurgent germans who catch the eye of the critics and audiences alike .
german film has once again become truly international with transatlantic hits and widespread european success with such films as " das experiment " -lrb- the experiment -rrb- and " halbe treppe " -lrb- grill point -rrb- .
this year , a fresh crop of important german films are set to illuminate the berlin film festival in the " competition " section and the " panorama " program for art house productions .
the home country continues its steady recovery by presenting three world premieres amongst the january nominations for the festival next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel brühl .
the first of the world premieres at the festival will be director wolfgang becker 's latest opus " good bye , lenin ! " described as " a tragicomic farce about people and systems . "
the film , entered into the " competition " section , stars german film award-winners daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the festival will also present the first showing of oskar roehler ’ s love story " der alte affe angst " -lrb- angst -rrb- , featuring marie bäumer , andré hennicke and vadim glowna , which follows the sensitive relationship of a couple who are confronted with the problems of death and deceit .
another exclusive screening will be that of " lichter " -lrb- distant lights -rrb- , the new film from hans-christian schmid which tells five interwoven tales that the director describes as " following a single protagonists ’ fears , existential problems , longings and hopes in the area along the german-polish border . " the cast includes august diehl , herbert knaup , devid striesow and maria simon , among others .
as well as new features , another film that is expected to make an impact at the festival is director jörg siepmann 's documentary " the golden lemons , " about a hamburg rock group 's madcap tour across the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annett renneberg .
the strong german presence in the main festival program will be supported by an entry in the " panorama " art house selection .
leipzig 's reflex films will present igor zaritzki 's " devot " -lrb- humble -rrb- , an intimate drama with a roller-coaster ride of emotional turns starring annett renneberg and simon böer .
german films in the " perspektive deutsches kino " series will once again offer an attractive program .
the series , founded in 2002 , strives to present films and filmmakers who are deemed to have what it takes to shape the future of german-language cinema .
this year 's series will open on february 7th with " sie haben knut " -lrb- they 've got knut -rrb- , the screen debut of award winning television director stefan krohmer and will be followed by martin gypkens ’ " wir " -lrb- we -rrb- , a study of personal crisis .
documentaries in the program deal with a young neo-nazi 's struggle for emancipation - " bernau liegt am meer " -lrb- bernau faces the sea -rrb- by martina döcker - and bernd fischer ’ s " grüße aus dachau " -lrb- greetings from dachau -rrb- - a depiction of a town with a dreadful history as it futilely strives for normality .
new digital technology is put through its paces in two examples from cologne-based production houses .
" science fiction " by franz müller has two actors improvise inevitable conflicts in magical but frightful tales while tom schreiber ’ s " narren " -lrb- fool -rrb- is a radical digital project from wim wenders ' road movies production company where the hero experiences the whirl of carnival in cologne from its darkest side . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two films share the golden bear japanese director hayao miyazaki 's animated feature " spirited away " and british director paul greengrass 's northern ireland drama " bloody sunday " are co-winners of the 2002 berlin film festival 's best film award .
chasing a golden bear the german film fest may not equal the glamour of cannes or venice , but it has perhaps the widest and most eclectic mix of any film festival in the world .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .
struck thinks the military should be given more flexibility to deal with domestic threats . “ we won ’ t be able to get around amending the constitution , ” struck told the news magazine der spiegel .
the social democrat has commissioned a working group to examine the bundeswehr ’ s legal basis for dealing with domestic threats , according to the newsweekly . limits of the law currently , germany 's constitution only permits the bundeswehr to conduct missions domestically in cases where the country faces the threat of invasion or when natural catastrophes or large accidents occur .
the military is also prohibited from assuming police-like functions , like running crowd control at public demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although two military sharpshooters were prepared to shoot down the hijacked glider , for example , the defense minister was unable to give them permission .
meanwhile , the frankfurt incident has kindled a spirited debate on the domestic role of the military in a country where memories of world war ii still linger . friends and foes angela merkel , who heads the parliamentary group of the oppositional christian democractic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , described struck ’ s comments as an interesting development .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , both support the passage of a constitutional amendment to modernize the country ’ s domestic security policies , merkel told reuters . her colleague , wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu / csu parliamentary group , declared an amendment necessary to deal with the changing threats to germany ’ s security .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .
struck thinks the military should be given more flexibility to deal with domestic threats . “ we won ’ t be able to get around amending the constitution , ” struck told the news magazine der spiegel .
the social democrat has commissioned a working group to examine the bundeswehr ’ s legal basis for dealing with domestic threats , according to the newsweekly . limits of the law currently , germany 's constitution only permits the bundeswehr to conduct missions domestically in cases where the country faces the threat of invasion or when natural catastrophes or large accidents occur .
the military is also prohibited from assuming police-like functions , like running crowd control at public demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although two military sharpshooters were prepared to shoot down the hijacked glider , for example , the defense minister was unable to give them permission .
meanwhile , the frankfurt incident has kindled a spirited debate on the domestic role of the military in a country where memories of world war ii still linger . friends and foes angela merkel , who heads the parliamentary group of the oppositional christian democractic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , described struck ’ s comments as an interesting development .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , both support the passage of a constitutional amendment to modernize the country ’ s domestic security policies , merkel told reuters . her colleague , wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu / csu parliamentary group , declared an amendment necessary to deal with the changing threats to germany ’ s security .

and it looks like german films will be among those vying for the coveted golden bear award . with just under a month to go , the names of nominees are beginning to filter through for the critics prize at the 53rd berlin international film festival which begins on february 6th .
the names of 19 films from europe , asia , the united states and africa have been confirmed for the main " competition " program of the festival with germany offering strong contenders for the coveted golden bear award for best film .
the new film from oscar winning director steven soderburgh and the much-anticipated return to form of martin scorsese will adorn the festival which will run from the 6th to the 16th but it is expected to be the resurgent germans who catch the eye of the critics and audiences alike .
german film has once again become truly international with transatlantic hits and widespread european success with such films as " das experiment " -lrb- the experiment -rrb- and " halbe treppe " -lrb- grill point -rrb- .
this year , a fresh crop of important german films are set to illuminate the berlin film festival in the " competition " section and the " panorama " program for art house productions .
the home country continues its steady recovery by presenting three world premieres amongst the january nominations for the festival next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel brühl .
the first of the world premieres at the festival will be director wolfgang becker 's latest opus " good bye , lenin ! " described as " a tragicomic farce about people and systems . "

german films in the " perspektive deutsches kino " series will once again offer an attractive program .
the series , founded in 2002 , strives to present films and filmmakers who are deemed to have what it takes to shape the future of german-language cinema .
this year 's series will open on february 7th with " sie haben knut " -lrb- they 've got knut -rrb- , the screen debut of award winning television director stefan krohmer and will be followed by martin gypkens ’ " wir " -lrb- we -rrb- , a study of personal crisis .

and it looks like german films will be among those vying for the coveted golden bear award . with just under a month to go , the names of nominees are beginning to filter through for the critics prize at the 53rd berlin international film festival which begins on february 6th .
the names of 19 films from europe , asia , the united states and africa have been confirmed for the main " competition " program of the festival with germany offering strong contenders for the coveted golden bear award for best film .
the new film from oscar winning director steven soderburgh and the much-anticipated return to form of martin scorsese will adorn the festival which will run from the 6th to the 16th but it is expected to be the resurgent germans who catch the eye of the critics and audiences alike .
german film has once again become truly international with transatlantic hits and widespread european success with such films as " das experiment " -lrb- the experiment -rrb- and " halbe treppe " -lrb- grill point -rrb- .
this year , a fresh crop of important german films are set to illuminate the berlin film festival in the " competition " section and the " panorama " program for art house productions .
the home country continues its steady recovery by presenting three world premieres amongst the january nominations for the festival next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel brühl .
the first of the world premieres at the festival will be director wolfgang becker 's latest opus " good bye , lenin ! " described as " a tragicomic farce about people and systems . "
the film , entered into the " competition " section , stars german film award-winners daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the festival will also present the first showing of oskar roehler ’ s love story " der alte affe angst " -lrb- angst -rrb- , featuring marie bäumer , andré hennicke and vadim glowna , which follows the sensitive relationship of a couple who are confronted with the problems of death and deceit .
another exclusive screening will be that of " lichter " -lrb- distant lights -rrb- , the new film from hans-christian schmid which tells five interwoven tales that the director describes as " following a single protagonists ’ fears , existential problems , longings and hopes in the area along the german-polish border . " the cast includes august diehl , herbert knaup , devid striesow and maria simon , among others .
as well as new features , another film that is expected to make an impact at the festival is director jörg siepmann 's documentary " the golden lemons , " about a hamburg rock group 's madcap tour across the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annett renneberg .
the strong german presence in the main festival program will be supported by an entry in the " panorama " art house selection .
leipzig 's reflex films will present igor zaritzki 's " devot " -lrb- humble -rrb- , an intimate drama with a roller-coaster ride of emotional turns starring annett renneberg and simon böer .
german films in the " perspektive deutsches kino " series will once again offer an attractive program .
the series , founded in 2002 , strives to present films and filmmakers who are deemed to have what it takes to shape the future of german-language cinema .
this year 's series will open on february 7th with " sie haben knut " -lrb- they 've got knut -rrb- , the screen debut of award winning television director stefan krohmer and will be followed by martin gypkens ’ " wir " -lrb- we -rrb- , a study of personal crisis .
documentaries in the program deal with a young neo-nazi 's struggle for emancipation - " bernau liegt am meer " -lrb- bernau faces the sea -rrb- by martina döcker - and bernd fischer ’ s " grüße aus dachau " -lrb- greetings from dachau -rrb- - a depiction of a town with a dreadful history as it futilely strives for normality .
new digital technology is put through its paces in two examples from cologne-based production houses .
" science fiction " by franz müller has two actors improvise inevitable conflicts in magical but frightful tales while tom schreiber ’ s " narren " -lrb- fool -rrb- is a radical digital project from wim wenders ' road movies production company where the hero experiences the whirl of carnival in cologne from its darkest side . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two films share the golden bear japanese director hayao miyazaki 's animated feature " spirited away " and british director paul greengrass 's northern ireland drama " bloody sunday " are co-winners of the 2002 berlin film festival 's best film award .
chasing a golden bear the german film fest may not equal the glamour of cannes or venice , but it has perhaps the widest and most eclectic mix of any film festival in the world .

but plans to display the works in switzerland failed following sharp protests . the friedrich-christian flick collection is one of the world 's biggest private holdings of contemporary art .
from 2004 onward , the over 2,000 work collection will be shown in its entirety in berlin for the first time ever .
the decision came after months of negotiations between flick and the stiftung preussischer kulturbesitz , the administrative body that runs berlin 's state museums .
the move follows a failed effort to exhibit the collection in zurich .
the jewish community and cultural organizations had blocked flick ’ s plans to build a special museum for his collection in zurich designed by star dutch architect rem koolhaas .
critics opposed the exhibit because much of the collection was purchased with the fortune amassed by the flicks under the nazis .
facing the past flick 's grandfather , friedrich flick , was one of adolf hitler 's largest arms manufacturers and helped fuel nazi germany 's war machine .
following world war ii , he was sentenced to seven years in prison for crimes including the use of slave labor in his factories and cooperating with the nazis .
he was pardoned in 1950 .
friedrich-christian flick has also been criticized for refusing to contribute to the fund set up by german industry and the federal government to compensate those forced to work for the nazis .
but the wealthy collector has said he does n't see how he can be guilty of something which he did n't do .
instead , flick has referred to his " foundation against xenophobia , racism and intolerance . "
at a press conference on thursday announcing the deal , flick stressed that he was not avoiding the criticism of his family history .
he said he had faced up to it .
this past was one of the reasons he acquired critical works , such as those by bruce nauman , for his collection , flick said .
taking art hostage berlin 's culture minister , christina weiss , said she understood that flick had to " put up with " questions regarding his family 's past .
but she added that she did n't understand how a tie could be made between the nazi era and a collection of contemporary art .
" how can one attempt to take art hostage and condemn it to disrespect ? "
weiss asked the assembled journalists .
neither the artists nor their works deserved this , she said .
the friedrich-christian flick collection includes works by some 150 artists , including bruce nauman , marcel duchamp , piet mondrian , kurt schwitters , gerhard richter , sigmar polke , richard serra , on kawara und nam june paik .
the collection will be displayed at the rieck-halle gallery next to berlin 's hamburger bahnhof museum for contemporary art for an initial period of seven years .
flick will finance the elaborate modifications necessary to the building . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

statesmen from both countries hope the deal will revitalize a once tight relationship that has been lacklustre in recent years . among the most revolutionary proposals is that of encouraging french and german ministers to take part in each other 's cabinet meetings .
as foreseen under draft versions of the plan , ministers would then attempt to enact identical legislation in areas such as civil and family law and education standards . the guardian newspaper of london reported that draft versions of the declaration also called for the appointment of a top official responsible for promoting cooperation between the two countries . elysee contract signed by de gaulle and adenauer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer and charles de gaulle the declaration being discussed is the result of nearly a dozen franco-german summits over the past year and is timed for release on jan .
22 , the 40th anniversary of the so-called elysee contract signed by west german chancellor konrad adenauer -lrb- left -rrb- and french president charles de gaulle -lrb- right -rrb- in 1963 . the 1963 agreement ended long-standing tensions between the countries and established the groundwork for cooperation on issues of foreign policy . that issue , however , is a thorny one for schröder and chirac these days .
germany has repeatedly said it will not participate in a possible war against iraq , while france has hinted that it might be willing to contribute troops to a u.s.-led invation . " iraq will be the acid test for the claim that we want to cultivate special relations between the two countries , " rudolf von thadden , coordinator of franco-german relations in the german foreign ministry , told the handelsblatt newspaper . quick test of friendship pact foreseen if adopted on jan .
22 , the declaration of cooperation would be put to the test quickly after u.n. weapons inspectors in iraq report on the situation on jan .
27 . " the declaration would be rendered meaningless if a week later paris stood shoulder to shoulder with the victorious allies of 1945 and not with their most important partner in respect to seeking a common european position , " von thadden said . earlier this month , germany began a two-year stint on the u.n. security council , while france is a permanent member . while the franco-german cooperation pact is still in the works , british leaders are already on the alert .
the guardian called the initiative " the latest , and most striking , evidence of a campaign by the two countries to give renewed momentum to their special relationship , for years the driving force behind european integration . " german-french cooperation on european policy last year , the french and germans ended a long-standing dispute about european agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the european union 's overall budget and subsidizes french farmers to the tune of billions .
and just prior to last year 's copenhagen summit , the two countries aligned their policies on turkey 's request to join the european union . if all goes as planned , the german and french parliaments will hold their first-ever joint meeting on jan .
22 . as a gesture of friendship , the french hosts at versailles plan a festive dinner at which german white wine and french red wine will be served for toasting the successes of the past 10 years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe still divided over iraq european leaders are still wringing their hands over a common policy towards iraq against a backdrop of mass demonstrations against military force and diplomatic tension at the security council .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .
struck thinks the military should be given more flexibility to deal with domestic threats . “ we won ’ t be able to get around amending the constitution , ” struck told the news magazine der spiegel .
the social democrat has commissioned a working group to examine the bundeswehr ’ s legal basis for dealing with domestic threats , according to the newsweekly . limits of the law currently , germany 's constitution only permits the bundeswehr to conduct missions domestically in cases where the country faces the threat of invasion or when natural catastrophes or large accidents occur .
the military is also prohibited from assuming police-like functions , like running crowd control at public demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although two military sharpshooters were prepared to shoot down the hijacked glider , for example , the defense minister was unable to give them permission .
meanwhile , the frankfurt incident has kindled a spirited debate on the domestic role of the military in a country where memories of world war ii still linger . friends and foes angela merkel , who heads the parliamentary group of the oppositional christian democractic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , described struck ’ s comments as an interesting development .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , both support the passage of a constitutional amendment to modernize the country ’ s domestic security policies , merkel told reuters . her colleague , wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu / csu parliamentary group , declared an amendment necessary to deal with the changing threats to germany ’ s security .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schäuble maintained that only the bundeswehr could protect germany from the dangers that airplanes could present . meanwhile , leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and oppositional free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- disagree with the defense minister 's new direction .
the spd 's parliamentary group spokesman for domestic policy , dieter wiefelspütz , called a constitutional amendment superfluous .
“ in article 35 , the constitution allows the armed forces to operate against terrorist attacks within the country when the police ’ s resources alone are insufficient , ” wiefelspütz wrote in the saarbrücker zeitung newspaper . the fdp 's parliamentary group leader , jörg van essen , stressed that the bundeswehr has policed german air space since the air force was first constituted and as such already has a legal basis for acting in cases like the frankfurt hijacking . the chairman of the german police ’ s union , konrad freiberg , also voiced his opposition to a constitutional amendment over the weekend .
freiberg said he believes the bundeswehr already had a legal basis for acting against strambach .

the names of 19 films from europe , asia , the united states and africa have been confirmed for the main " competition " program of the festival with germany offering strong contenders for the coveted golden bear award for best film .
the new film from oscar winning director steven soderburgh and the much-anticipated return to form of martin scorsese will adorn the festival which will run from the 6th to the 16th but it is expected to be the resurgent germans who catch the eye of the critics and audiences alike .
german film has once again become truly international with transatlantic hits and widespread european success with such films as " das experiment " -lrb- the experiment -rrb- and " halbe treppe " -lrb- grill point -rrb- .
this year , a fresh crop of important german films are set to illuminate the berlin film festival in the " competition " section and the " panorama " program for art house productions .
the home country continues its steady recovery by presenting three world premieres amongst the january nominations for the festival next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel brühl .
the first of the world premieres at the festival will be director wolfgang becker 's latest opus " good bye , lenin ! " described as " a tragicomic farce about people and systems . "

another exclusive screening will be that of " lichter " -lrb- distant lights -rrb- , the new film from hans-christian schmid which tells five interwoven tales that the director describes as " following a single protagonists ’ fears , existential problems , longings and hopes in the area along the german-polish border . " the cast includes august diehl , herbert knaup , devid striesow and maria simon , among others .
as well as new features , another film that is expected to make an impact at the festival is director jörg siepmann 's documentary " the golden lemons , " about a hamburg rock group 's madcap tour across the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annett renneberg .

and it looks like german films will be among those vying for the coveted golden bear award . with just under a month to go , the names of nominees are beginning to filter through for the critics prize at the 53rd berlin international film festival which begins on february 6th .
the names of 19 films from europe , asia , the united states and africa have been confirmed for the main " competition " program of the festival with germany offering strong contenders for the coveted golden bear award for best film .
the new film from oscar winning director steven soderburgh and the much-anticipated return to form of martin scorsese will adorn the festival which will run from the 6th to the 16th but it is expected to be the resurgent germans who catch the eye of the critics and audiences alike .
german film has once again become truly international with transatlantic hits and widespread european success with such films as " das experiment " -lrb- the experiment -rrb- and " halbe treppe " -lrb- grill point -rrb- .
this year , a fresh crop of important german films are set to illuminate the berlin film festival in the " competition " section and the " panorama " program for art house productions .
the home country continues its steady recovery by presenting three world premieres amongst the january nominations for the festival next month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel brühl .
the first of the world premieres at the festival will be director wolfgang becker 's latest opus " good bye , lenin ! " described as " a tragicomic farce about people and systems . "
the film , entered into the " competition " section , stars german film award-winners daniel brühl and katrin sass .
the festival will also present the first showing of oskar roehler ’ s love story " der alte affe angst " -lrb- angst -rrb- , featuring marie bäumer , andré hennicke and vadim glowna , which follows the sensitive relationship of a couple who are confronted with the problems of death and deceit .
another exclusive screening will be that of " lichter " -lrb- distant lights -rrb- , the new film from hans-christian schmid which tells five interwoven tales that the director describes as " following a single protagonists ’ fears , existential problems , longings and hopes in the area along the german-polish border . " the cast includes august diehl , herbert knaup , devid striesow and maria simon , among others .
as well as new features , another film that is expected to make an impact at the festival is director jörg siepmann 's documentary " the golden lemons , " about a hamburg rock group 's madcap tour across the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annett renneberg .
the strong german presence in the main festival program will be supported by an entry in the " panorama " art house selection .
leipzig 's reflex films will present igor zaritzki 's " devot " -lrb- humble -rrb- , an intimate drama with a roller-coaster ride of emotional turns starring annett renneberg and simon böer .
german films in the " perspektive deutsches kino " series will once again offer an attractive program .
the series , founded in 2002 , strives to present films and filmmakers who are deemed to have what it takes to shape the future of german-language cinema .
this year 's series will open on february 7th with " sie haben knut " -lrb- they 've got knut -rrb- , the screen debut of award winning television director stefan krohmer and will be followed by martin gypkens ’ " wir " -lrb- we -rrb- , a study of personal crisis .
documentaries in the program deal with a young neo-nazi 's struggle for emancipation - " bernau liegt am meer " -lrb- bernau faces the sea -rrb- by martina döcker - and bernd fischer ’ s " grüße aus dachau " -lrb- greetings from dachau -rrb- - a depiction of a town with a dreadful history as it futilely strives for normality .
new digital technology is put through its paces in two examples from cologne-based production houses .
" science fiction " by franz müller has two actors improvise inevitable conflicts in magical but frightful tales while tom schreiber ’ s " narren " -lrb- fool -rrb- is a radical digital project from wim wenders ' road movies production company where the hero experiences the whirl of carnival in cologne from its darkest side . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two films share the golden bear japanese director hayao miyazaki 's animated feature " spirited away " and british director paul greengrass 's northern ireland drama " bloody sunday " are co-winners of the 2002 berlin film festival 's best film award .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .
struck thinks the military should be given more flexibility to deal with domestic threats . “ we won ’ t be able to get around amending the constitution , ” struck told the news magazine der spiegel .
the social democrat has commissioned a working group to examine the bundeswehr ’ s legal basis for dealing with domestic threats , according to the newsweekly . limits of the law currently , germany 's constitution only permits the bundeswehr to conduct missions domestically in cases where the country faces the threat of invasion or when natural catastrophes or large accidents occur .
the military is also prohibited from assuming police-like functions , like running crowd control at public demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although two military sharpshooters were prepared to shoot down the hijacked glider , for example , the defense minister was unable to give them permission .
meanwhile , the frankfurt incident has kindled a spirited debate on the domestic role of the military in a country where memories of world war ii still linger . friends and foes angela merkel , who heads the parliamentary group of the oppositional christian democractic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , described struck ’ s comments as an interesting development .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , both support the passage of a constitutional amendment to modernize the country ’ s domestic security policies , merkel told reuters . her colleague , wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu / csu parliamentary group , declared an amendment necessary to deal with the changing threats to germany ’ s security .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schäuble maintained that only the bundeswehr could protect germany from the dangers that airplanes could present . meanwhile , leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and oppositional free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- disagree with the defense minister 's new direction .
the spd 's parliamentary group spokesman for domestic policy , dieter wiefelspütz , called a constitutional amendment superfluous .
“ in article 35 , the constitution allows the armed forces to operate against terrorist attacks within the country when the police ’ s resources alone are insufficient , ” wiefelspütz wrote in the saarbrücker zeitung newspaper . the fdp 's parliamentary group leader , jörg van essen , stressed that the bundeswehr has policed german air space since the air force was first constituted and as such already has a legal basis for acting in cases like the frankfurt hijacking . the chairman of the german police ’ s union , konrad freiberg , also voiced his opposition to a constitutional amendment over the weekend .
freiberg said he believes the bundeswehr already had a legal basis for acting against strambach .
not only would a change to the constitution be unnecessary , but in the context of a “ pending iraq war , such a suggestion is a political powder keg , ” he said . with fears of a terror attack in germany running high with the arrest of two alleged high-ranking al qaida members in frankfurt and trials continuing in two cases involving suspected terrorists in hamburg and frankfurt , the issue is likely to smolder for months to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german air security debate remains grounded german officials prepare to tighten air security across the country in the wake of a recent frankfurt hijack .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .
struck thinks the military should be given more flexibility to deal with domestic threats . “ we won ’ t be able to get around amending the constitution , ” struck told the news magazine der spiegel .
the social democrat has commissioned a working group to examine the bundeswehr ’ s legal basis for dealing with domestic threats , according to the newsweekly . limits of the law currently , germany 's constitution only permits the bundeswehr to conduct missions domestically in cases where the country faces the threat of invasion or when natural catastrophes or large accidents occur .
the military is also prohibited from assuming police-like functions , like running crowd control at public demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although two military sharpshooters were prepared to shoot down the hijacked glider , for example , the defense minister was unable to give them permission .
meanwhile , the frankfurt incident has kindled a spirited debate on the domestic role of the military in a country where memories of world war ii still linger . friends and foes angela merkel , who heads the parliamentary group of the oppositional christian democractic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , described struck ’ s comments as an interesting development .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , both support the passage of a constitutional amendment to modernize the country ’ s domestic security policies , merkel told reuters . her colleague , wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu / csu parliamentary group , declared an amendment necessary to deal with the changing threats to germany ’ s security .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schäuble maintained that only the bundeswehr could protect germany from the dangers that airplanes could present . meanwhile , leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and oppositional free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- disagree with the defense minister 's new direction .
the spd 's parliamentary group spokesman for domestic policy , dieter wiefelspütz , called a constitutional amendment superfluous .
“ in article 35 , the constitution allows the armed forces to operate against terrorist attacks within the country when the police ’ s resources alone are insufficient , ” wiefelspütz wrote in the saarbrücker zeitung newspaper . the fdp 's parliamentary group leader , jörg van essen , stressed that the bundeswehr has policed german air space since the air force was first constituted and as such already has a legal basis for acting in cases like the frankfurt hijacking . the chairman of the german police ’ s union , konrad freiberg , also voiced his opposition to a constitutional amendment over the weekend .
freiberg said he believes the bundeswehr already had a legal basis for acting against strambach .
not only would a change to the constitution be unnecessary , but in the context of a “ pending iraq war , such a suggestion is a political powder keg , ” he said . with fears of a terror attack in germany running high with the arrest of two alleged high-ranking al qaida members in frankfurt and trials continuing in two cases involving suspected terrorists in hamburg and frankfurt , the issue is likely to smolder for months to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german air security debate remains grounded german officials prepare to tighten air security across the country in the wake of a recent frankfurt hijack .

but plans to display the works in switzerland failed following sharp protests . the friedrich-christian flick collection is one of the world 's biggest private holdings of contemporary art .
from 2004 onward , the over 2,000 work collection will be shown in its entirety in berlin for the first time ever .
the decision came after months of negotiations between flick and the stiftung preussischer kulturbesitz , the administrative body that runs berlin 's state museums .
the move follows a failed effort to exhibit the collection in zurich .
the jewish community and cultural organizations had blocked flick ’ s plans to build a special museum for his collection in zurich designed by star dutch architect rem koolhaas .
critics opposed the exhibit because much of the collection was purchased with the fortune amassed by the flicks under the nazis .
facing the past flick 's grandfather , friedrich flick , was one of adolf hitler 's largest arms manufacturers and helped fuel nazi germany 's war machine .
following world war ii , he was sentenced to seven years in prison for crimes including the use of slave labor in his factories and cooperating with the nazis .
he was pardoned in 1950 .
friedrich-christian flick has also been criticized for refusing to contribute to the fund set up by german industry and the federal government to compensate those forced to work for the nazis .
but the wealthy collector has said he does n't see how he can be guilty of something which he did n't do .
instead , flick has referred to his " foundation against xenophobia , racism and intolerance . "
at a press conference on thursday announcing the deal , flick stressed that he was not avoiding the criticism of his family history .
he said he had faced up to it .
this past was one of the reasons he acquired critical works , such as those by bruce nauman , for his collection , flick said .
taking art hostage berlin 's culture minister , christina weiss , said she understood that flick had to " put up with " questions regarding his family 's past .
but she added that she did n't understand how a tie could be made between the nazi era and a collection of contemporary art .
" how can one attempt to take art hostage and condemn it to disrespect ? "
weiss asked the assembled journalists .
neither the artists nor their works deserved this , she said .
the friedrich-christian flick collection includes works by some 150 artists , including bruce nauman , marcel duchamp , piet mondrian , kurt schwitters , gerhard richter , sigmar polke , richard serra , on kawara und nam june paik .
the collection will be displayed at the rieck-halle gallery next to berlin 's hamburger bahnhof museum for contemporary art for an initial period of seven years .

but plans to display the works in switzerland failed following sharp protests . the friedrich-christian flick collection is one of the world 's biggest private holdings of contemporary art .
from 2004 onward , the over 2,000 work collection will be shown in its entirety in berlin for the first time ever .
the decision came after months of negotiations between flick and the stiftung preussischer kulturbesitz , the administrative body that runs berlin 's state museums .
the move follows a failed effort to exhibit the collection in zurich .
the jewish community and cultural organizations had blocked flick ’ s plans to build a special museum for his collection in zurich designed by star dutch architect rem koolhaas .
critics opposed the exhibit because much of the collection was purchased with the fortune amassed by the flicks under the nazis .
facing the past flick 's grandfather , friedrich flick , was one of adolf hitler 's largest arms manufacturers and helped fuel nazi germany 's war machine .
following world war ii , he was sentenced to seven years in prison for crimes including the use of slave labor in his factories and cooperating with the nazis .
he was pardoned in 1950 .
friedrich-christian flick has also been criticized for refusing to contribute to the fund set up by german industry and the federal government to compensate those forced to work for the nazis .
but the wealthy collector has said he does n't see how he can be guilty of something which he did n't do .
instead , flick has referred to his " foundation against xenophobia , racism and intolerance . "
at a press conference on thursday announcing the deal , flick stressed that he was not avoiding the criticism of his family history .
he said he had faced up to it .
this past was one of the reasons he acquired critical works , such as those by bruce nauman , for his collection , flick said .
taking art hostage berlin 's culture minister , christina weiss , said she understood that flick had to " put up with " questions regarding his family 's past .
but she added that she did n't understand how a tie could be made between the nazi era and a collection of contemporary art .
" how can one attempt to take art hostage and condemn it to disrespect ? "
weiss asked the assembled journalists .
neither the artists nor their works deserved this , she said .
the friedrich-christian flick collection includes works by some 150 artists , including bruce nauman , marcel duchamp , piet mondrian , kurt schwitters , gerhard richter , sigmar polke , richard serra , on kawara und nam june paik .
the collection will be displayed at the rieck-halle gallery next to berlin 's hamburger bahnhof museum for contemporary art for an initial period of seven years .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .
struck thinks the military should be given more flexibility to deal with domestic threats . “ we won ’ t be able to get around amending the constitution , ” struck told the news magazine der spiegel .
the social democrat has commissioned a working group to examine the bundeswehr ’ s legal basis for dealing with domestic threats , according to the newsweekly . limits of the law currently , germany 's constitution only permits the bundeswehr to conduct missions domestically in cases where the country faces the threat of invasion or when natural catastrophes or large accidents occur .

the decision came after months of negotiations between flick and the stiftung preussischer kulturbesitz , the administrative body that runs berlin 's state museums .
the move follows a failed effort to exhibit the collection in zurich .
the jewish community and cultural organizations had blocked flick ’ s plans to build a special museum for his collection in zurich designed by star dutch architect rem koolhaas .
critics opposed the exhibit because much of the collection was purchased with the fortune amassed by the flicks under the nazis .
facing the past flick 's grandfather , friedrich flick , was one of adolf hitler 's largest arms manufacturers and helped fuel nazi germany 's war machine .
following world war ii , he was sentenced to seven years in prison for crimes including the use of slave labor in his factories and cooperating with the nazis .
he was pardoned in 1950 .
friedrich-christian flick has also been criticized for refusing to contribute to the fund set up by german industry and the federal government to compensate those forced to work for the nazis .
but the wealthy collector has said he does n't see how he can be guilty of something which he did n't do .
instead , flick has referred to his " foundation against xenophobia , racism and intolerance . "
at a press conference on thursday announcing the deal , flick stressed that he was not avoiding the criticism of his family history .
he said he had faced up to it .
this past was one of the reasons he acquired critical works , such as those by bruce nauman , for his collection , flick said .
taking art hostage berlin 's culture minister , christina weiss , said she understood that flick had to " put up with " questions regarding his family 's past .
but she added that she did n't understand how a tie could be made between the nazi era and a collection of contemporary art .

weiss asked the assembled journalists .
neither the artists nor their works deserved this , she said .
the friedrich-christian flick collection includes works by some 150 artists , including bruce nauman , marcel duchamp , piet mondrian , kurt schwitters , gerhard richter , sigmar polke , richard serra , on kawara und nam june paik .

but plans to display the works in switzerland failed following sharp protests . the friedrich-christian flick collection is one of the world 's biggest private holdings of contemporary art .
from 2004 onward , the over 2,000 work collection will be shown in its entirety in berlin for the first time ever .
the decision came after months of negotiations between flick and the stiftung preussischer kulturbesitz , the administrative body that runs berlin 's state museums .
the move follows a failed effort to exhibit the collection in zurich .
the jewish community and cultural organizations had blocked flick ’ s plans to build a special museum for his collection in zurich designed by star dutch architect rem koolhaas .
critics opposed the exhibit because much of the collection was purchased with the fortune amassed by the flicks under the nazis .
facing the past flick 's grandfather , friedrich flick , was one of adolf hitler 's largest arms manufacturers and helped fuel nazi germany 's war machine .
following world war ii , he was sentenced to seven years in prison for crimes including the use of slave labor in his factories and cooperating with the nazis .
he was pardoned in 1950 .
friedrich-christian flick has also been criticized for refusing to contribute to the fund set up by german industry and the federal government to compensate those forced to work for the nazis .

germany ’ s defense minister says he is examining the idea of broadening the military 's mandate to include domestic missions in 9/11-type situations .
but critics say such a move is unnecessary . defense minister peter struck has been looking for answers since a pistol-toting , mentally-disturbed man stole a motorized glider and threatened to crash it into frankfurt ’ s financial district on jan .
5 . germany ’ s constitution prevented the bundeswehr from shooting down psychology student franz stephan strambach , 31 , who terrorized the city and threatened to crash into the european central bank 's headquarters during his two-hour joyride .
struck thinks the military should be given more flexibility to deal with domestic threats . “ we won ’ t be able to get around amending the constitution , ” struck told the news magazine der spiegel .
the social democrat has commissioned a working group to examine the bundeswehr ’ s legal basis for dealing with domestic threats , according to the newsweekly . limits of the law currently , germany 's constitution only permits the bundeswehr to conduct missions domestically in cases where the country faces the threat of invasion or when natural catastrophes or large accidents occur .
the military is also prohibited from assuming police-like functions , like running crowd control at public demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although two military sharpshooters were prepared to shoot down the hijacked glider , for example , the defense minister was unable to give them permission .
meanwhile , the frankfurt incident has kindled a spirited debate on the domestic role of the military in a country where memories of world war ii still linger . friends and foes angela merkel , who heads the parliamentary group of the oppositional christian democractic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , described struck ’ s comments as an interesting development .
the cdu and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , both support the passage of a constitutional amendment to modernize the country ’ s domestic security policies , merkel told reuters . her colleague , wolfgang schäuble , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu / csu parliamentary group , declared an amendment necessary to deal with the changing threats to germany ’ s security .
in an article in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schäuble maintained that only the bundeswehr could protect germany from the dangers that airplanes could present . meanwhile , leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and oppositional free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- disagree with the defense minister 's new direction .
the spd 's parliamentary group spokesman for domestic policy , dieter wiefelspütz , called a constitutional amendment superfluous .
“ in article 35 , the constitution allows the armed forces to operate against terrorist attacks within the country when the police ’ s resources alone are insufficient , ” wiefelspütz wrote in the saarbrücker zeitung newspaper . the fdp 's parliamentary group leader , jörg van essen , stressed that the bundeswehr has policed german air space since the air force was first constituted and as such already has a legal basis for acting in cases like the frankfurt hijacking . the chairman of the german police ’ s union , konrad freiberg , also voiced his opposition to a constitutional amendment over the weekend .
freiberg said he believes the bundeswehr already had a legal basis for acting against strambach .
not only would a change to the constitution be unnecessary , but in the context of a “ pending iraq war , such a suggestion is a political powder keg , ” he said . with fears of a terror attack in germany running high with the arrest of two alleged high-ranking al qaida members in frankfurt and trials continuing in two cases involving suspected terrorists in hamburg and frankfurt , the issue is likely to smolder for months to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german air security debate remains grounded german officials prepare to tighten air security across the country in the wake of a recent frankfurt hijack .
but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack .

statesmen from both countries hope the deal will revitalize a once tight relationship that has been lacklustre in recent years . among the most revolutionary proposals is that of encouraging french and german ministers to take part in each other 's cabinet meetings .
as foreseen under draft versions of the plan , ministers would then attempt to enact identical legislation in areas such as civil and family law and education standards . the guardian newspaper of london reported that draft versions of the declaration also called for the appointment of a top official responsible for promoting cooperation between the two countries . elysee contract signed by de gaulle and adenauer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer and charles de gaulle the declaration being discussed is the result of nearly a dozen franco-german summits over the past year and is timed for release on jan .

27 . " the declaration would be rendered meaningless if a week later paris stood shoulder to shoulder with the victorious allies of 1945 and not with their most important partner in respect to seeking a common european position , " von thadden said . earlier this month , germany began a two-year stint on the u.n. security council , while france is a permanent member . while the franco-german cooperation pact is still in the works , british leaders are already on the alert .
the guardian called the initiative " the latest , and most striking , evidence of a campaign by the two countries to give renewed momentum to their special relationship , for years the driving force behind european integration .

ossett brewing company limited has won a lucrative contract to sell its beer to multiplexes and shops in tokyo .
the brewery , which was set-up in 1998 and currently employs four people , brews cask real ale but recently decided to start bottling its beer .
the company sent a sample of old gurner beer to virgin cinemas who decided to sell it in its tokyo multiplexes .
translated label brewery owner bob lawson said his son jamie had used contacts from his time working in japan to clinch the deal .
" this could be massive for us , " said mr lawson .
" we have spent weeks on the translated label design so that everything conforms to the proper japanese legislation .

the young offenders setting up the site explain why they think it will work .
he wears a hooded top , has turned his back on a life of crime and hangs out with local djs .
' rizer man ' is the sort of 20-something streetwise role model teenagers will listen to , according to the latest youth website .
rizer man likes sex football helping people dislikes being forced into things being told what to do prison the computer generated character steers young surfers around rizer.co.uk - a £ 1.1m highly branded project which has set up a site to discourage young people from crime .
rizer man is an alternative to authority figures such as teachers , youth workers or police officers .
" he has been arrested a few times .
he has been through the system so he knows what he is talking about , " says adam markhurst , 17 .
adam , a former burglar , is one of a number of young offenders from nottingham who are helping to set up the government funded website .
built on trust like rizer man - adam has turned away from crime and is now at college studying it .
" you want to know from somebody who has been there and done it .
adam says young people will trust rizer man " you 've got to build up a relationship with him - trust him . "
the site is due to go live in april and will explain in young people 's terms the likely consequences of their crimes .
design experts digit were brought in to provide the visual identity and branding of the site and have been working closely with the youngsters .
they have helped come up with the name of the site too , which has been chosen for its " edgy " feel and because it sounds like a nickname .
naming a youth website edgy , racy , uplifting brand personality good for graphic name grows on you symmetrical word nickname feel the site itself will feature text , audio , photographs and video and is aimed at young people with low literacy levels .
while the branding and identity of the site are seen as paramount , matty lyttle , 19 , another offender , says young people need to know about it .
matty , who has a violent past and became a father at the age of 16 , will be among a team which will run roadshows to highlight the website .
youth to youth " we will take it out to schools , youth groups - anywhere where young people are .
" it will be young person to young person .
setting up the site we have already had positive feedback on the rizer name peter armstrong " i think if we make it interesting enough and put enough information in there , put enough things to look at , then young people are going to look at it . "
rizer is being set up by the galleries of justice tourist attraction in nottingham .
it was chosen because of its history of working with young people on the issue of crime and social exclusion and is working with the citizen foundation to develop the content of the site .
peter armstrong , who is leading the project , says : " this is a real opportunity to open a new avenue of communication to young people at risk of becoming involved in crime . "

sarah from tyne & wear lived with debt for more than 15 years .
things started to go seriously wrong for her when her husband gave up work due to ill health in 1985 . "
one of the worst things was having to say no to my kids at christmas " sarah " it was a struggle but we were coping , then i fell pregnant and had to give up work for a while . "
when sarah turned to credit cards and loans to cover her existing borrowing , the slide into serious debt difficulties began .
" i was robbing peter to pay paul , " she admits .
christmas woe later , sarah was able to start her own small business and pay off some of her previous debt .
however , she was unaware that her husband was meanwhile siphoning off funds from the company and applying for new credit cards .
inevitably , the business folded , and sarah was devastated to discover that her husband had been taking out the credit cards in her name .
in short , when she finally asked her husband to leave in 1996 , sarah was left with debts of £ 13,500 and an annual income of just £ 8,500 a year from an office job .
" i did not know where to turn , " she said .
" one of the worst things was having to say no to my kids at christmas .
however , it brought us closer together in the end . "
debt management trap unaware that there was free advice available from charities such as the consumer credit counselling service or citizens advice , sarah tried a debt management firm . "
people in debt feel a terrible stigma , it is heartbreaking " sarah these companies promise to act as go-betweens between clients and their creditors .
" they gave me a budget which was helpful but they charged a fee and that money could and should have been used to pay off my debt . "
sarah has now got back on her feet after seeking advice from a leading debt charity .
in 2002 she became a homeowner and is now able to provide for her two children aged 16 and 11 .
stigma ironically , sarah now counsels other people with debts .
" it is good to help out - the problem is that people in debt feel a terrible stigma , it is heartbreaking .
" recently , i saw one 27 year old woman -lsb- who was -rsb- £ 40,000 in the red with no prospect of paying it back .
" i was the first person she had been able to speak to and she was very tearful indeed . "
debt race away although it has a happy ending sarah 's debt spiral story is far from unusual .
britons have spent the last decade piling up a debt mountain . "
house-price falls will leave people feeling more exposed as far as their debts are concerned " jonathan loynes capital economics although incomes are increasing , total debt as a percentage of average annual income has increased from 54 % in 1993 to 70 % in 2002 .
sarah says irresponsible lending is at the root of the uk debt explosion .
" lenders do not look at the overall financial position of people - asking can this person really afford more credit ?
" instead all they look at is if a person has kept to repayment plans in the past . "
house prices many economists say that borrowing in the uk has been made easier by low interest rates , near full employment and personal income outstripping inflation .
in addition , house-price rises mean that many people 's major asset - which they can borrow against - has been growing in value during recent years .
since 1988 debt has increased on average by 112 % while house prices have gone up by 141 % , according to a recent survey by the online bank egg .
but with the economy slowing and the property market - at least in london - running out of steam , many borrowers may be feeling under pressure .
' belt tightening ' jonathan loynes , chief economist at capital economics , told bbc news online that he expected house prices to fall 20 % during 2004 , leaving consumers with a bad-debt hangover .
" house-price falls will leave people feeling more exposed as far as their debts are concerned .
we will see a general belt tightening as people try to bring their debts under control . "
in the past , rising inflation eroded the value of personal debts , making them more manageable .
however , with inflation now so low , at about 2 % , it will take much longer for the debt to shrink in real terms .
as a result , many people could struggle , like sarah , to get on top of their debts .
your comments mum was a single parent bringing up three children and she managed to avoid such debt -lrb- without any state benefits i might add -rrb- .
obviously being made redundant is not something people can control , but there are such things as payment protection insurance which covers repayments in this eventuality .
if people are stupid enough to rack up so much debt with no means of paying it off then it 's their own fault .
there is no such thing as free money , and the sooner our money-crazy spending happy society realises this the better .
sd , uk it is the relentless pressure of modern society , especially at times like christmas , that persuades people to get into debt .
the endless offers of credit by finance companies and the pressure to have the latest fashions and products .
i was a single parent for 10 years and never gave in to it , as a result i am now debt free with my own house and am about to set up my own business .
the future is rosy and i 'll never be tempted to give in and buy things i do n't need and ca n't afford .
i 've seen too many friends go under , go bankrupt and sacrifice their futures - for what ?
louisa morgan , uk the single biggest problem behind this country 's debt-sustained economy is not just irresponsible lending and lack of consulation for each potential borrower - it 's the advertising methods used to hook people in the first place .
many satellite tv channels run back to back loan adverts every 15 minutes -lrb- it 's like brainwashing -rrb- , and all are either of the " why wait for a new car / holiday / home improvement " variety or , ironically , the " are you worried about debt - then take out a consolidation loan " type .
the sooner these companies stop shoving loans down the throats of those who ca n't really afford it the better ; and these adverts are preying on the hopes and dreams -lrb- and fears -rrb- of the nation -advertising standards should introduce rules for lenders. chris , uk i was in debt to the tune of £ 9,000 at the age of 19 as a result of living with a boyfriend for a year .
he did n't help to pay any of the bills so i had to , to make sure we had electricity , water and food .
i left when the lease ended and went back home to my parents for a year during which i paid the whole lot back .
it was miserable , i did n't go out or buy myself anything which was n't neccessary , so my only outgoings were food and rent .
i did n't tell my parents or friends about the debt because i was ashamed .
i lost 3 stones in weight and became a daily user of my local library as it was the only thing i could do for free !
i certainly learnt my lesson as 10 years on am i 'm still debt free .
i still have credit cards but i pay the entire amount off every month .
i do n't blame the credit card companies , i was the one that spent the money , i 'm just glad it was there for the taking as it made a hellish year much more bearable .
just remember , there is always light at the end of the ! tu ! nnel , even if you ca n't see it yet .
work out a budget and stick to it , write every little thing down that you spend money on , it really helps to see where you can make cutbacks , and do n't give up .
do n't take out loans to repay other debt and try to reduce your credit cards to just one that has a very low apr .
it may take one year , or five , and it will be hard , but you can do it and the quality of life you gain is absolutely worth it .
carrie , uk i left university over two and a half years ago having taken out my full quota of student loans .
during that time i have been working full time for a company in the city , i have yet to pay off that particualer debt and , thanks to the cost of living in london -lrb- rent , bills , food , transport costs -rrb- find that i now owe for a further two graduate loans -lrb- £ 6000 -rrb- and two credit cards -lrb- £ 6000 -rrb- .
i am not a big spender , i work pretty hard and yet i still seem to be permanantly in debt - i can not pursue the career i want until i 'm solvent - so am stuck in a job i do not enjoy .
it is like dragging around a huge ball and chain .
the banks just threw money at me after university -which was great at the time but i rue the day i ever signed on the line of my first graduate loan .
charlie , uk when i got my first job after leaving university , i got a credit card , and ran up a debt of £ 3000 .
things went from bad to worse and i 'm now £ 5000 in debt .
i too tried a debt management firm , but then found payplan , a company owned by a & l , who do n't charge a fee .
it will take me a while to pay it off .
in the meantime , i suffer from depression due to continuing phone calls from creditors .
darryl , england , uk i have run up £ 60,000 on credit cards and , quite frankly , i 'm terrified .
i have a decent paid job in london , but have no idea how i am going to pay it all back .
ranzar , uk with all respect to sarah , the root cause of the uk debt explosion is not irresponsible lending -lrb- indeed if such a thing was rife all lenders would quickly go out of business -rrb- .
individuals who borrow have to take responsibility for their own choices - i 'm afraid the responsibility lies solely with them .
nigel , uk i absolutely agree with sarah that irresponsible lending is the key to suffering , most notably by the big mortgage providers who have been the main drivers in this debt explosion both directly and indirectly .
the so-called " economists " employed by these companies will be exposed by the dramatic house price correction as at best ridiculously optimistic and at worst negligent in their forecast of house price growth , in the same way as stock analysts are now pilloried ruthless pawns of the investment banks .
the unforgiveable greed and arrogance of these institutions has left a legacy of suffering for normal people seduced by their flawed research .
so much for the abolition of boom and bust !
james , uk i was one of the naive millions who was promised a better life by going through university and completing my studies .
as the government refused to pay for one year i ended up turning to a bank to acquire a loan to complete my studies .
at the end of the studies , i spent almost 2 years searching for jobs and filling out 100s of applications forms .
i 'm now on a minimal salary job fighting to keep afloat with £ 15k of bank debts and approx £ 10k of student loans , despite the fact that my spending is very tight and not having credit cards .
mortgages ?
well i do n't think i would be able to saddle myself with another debt for some time !
and i see peers who never studied in he , and earn a lot more than i do , without the complication of debts .
dan a , uk when will people realise that in many cases it 's all about personal choice .
you choose to spend the money and therefore it 's up to you to pay it back .
it 's the same as the overweight people sueing mcdonalds , why do people have to have someone else to blame ?
nobody forces them to take the money , you can always say no .
if you ca n't then your own weakness leads you into debt .
do n't blame the lenders , blame the borrowers !
oj , england i agree that getting credit is all too easy , however i strongly believe that anyone borrowing heavily beyond their means must take responsibilty for their actions .
surely in many cases , it is pure greed and stupidity ?
advice : keep away from the high street stores and the pub until debts are paid !
andrew , uk i was £ 7,000 in debt at twenty after having credit cards and loans thrown at me by banks , although i do n't blame them , they are there to make profits .
after selling a house i managed to pay of some of the debts but still have around three thousand pounds owing three years later .
i am now in the lucky position that i live with my parents rent free which has allowed me to pay off alot more than i could have any other way .
i did try a debt management firm at one point , but instead of helping i ended up with a ccj and most of my debts with debt collection agencies .
currently i have a very bad credit rating and will do for a few years now , which i am quite happy about as it will stop me starting the spiral all over again .
it is all to do with willpower , i did n't have any when i was younger , hopefully now i have ! and wo n't end up in that mess again .
michelle , uk i have been in debt now ever since i started work when i was 17 , over 10 years now .
all thanks to my parent persuading me to get finance on a car i didn ¿ t even really want .
i have never been able to get on top of my debts as one debt creates another debt .
you are always short of money while just trying to make ends meet .
the problem has got so bad i have even considered giving up work as i have hardly seen anything of my wages for all my working life .
the solution is simple , just live out of your pocket from the start .
if you have n't got the cash , then you ca n't buy .
you will be far richer in the end .
charlie sweetman , london , uk i have just made my last repayment on my final loan .
at one point i reached over £ 21,000 worth of debt , the majority of which i built up during my university years .
the best advice i can offer is to consolidate all your debts and shop about for the best deal on a loan - it worked for me .
james , uk many people these days expect to be able to live out a certain lifestyle -lrb- as seen on tv -rrb- regardless of whether or not they can afford it .
credit cards , personal loans and automatic bank overdrafts offer a huge temptation to live now and pay later .
many years ago i borrowed money to buy a car .
the loan was reasonable but close to the time of the final payment i received an offer of a further loan .
it was tempting to receive another few thousand pounds and continue with similar monthly payments .
the trouble with this sort of " sustainable debt " is that any further demands on my funds maight cause me to slip into serious debt .
i ca n't believe how sneaky and predatory some tv adverts are when they target those in debt .
i saw one recently where a woman meets a friend in a supermarket car park loading heaps of shopping into a brand new car .
her friend explains that she has " consolidated her debts into one easy single payment " and now has enough over to splash out on a car !
basically she has borrowed enough money to pay off her debts .
that idea used to be a joke !
andy kelly , uk with little or no parental or other support , many students will have to turn to loans to support their education .
then after their course , they may need to take a graduate loan to actually move to a new job , buy decent clothes etc .
a graduate 's first job is probably not going to be highly paid , and therefore a signficant impact on reducing the loans borrowed is n't going to occur for some time .
this is exactly the path i took , and of course i wish i did n't take the loans , but to survive i had no choice .
to get a good future through education , it was necessary to become in debt .
luckily , buying a flat -lrb- 100 % mortgage funnily enough -rrb- and its increasing value has given me some relief as there is capital tied up in it that can pay off those loans if i choose to. ben , uk it 's sad and difficult for people when things go wrong and you have to provide for your family , but i think that a lot of debt is also people who simply want things they ca n't have .
blaming the lenders in this case is wrong .
john ladd , uk personally , i do n't borrow anymore , simply because i got sick of paying £ 25 for bank computer generated letters .
it simply should n't be allowed for financial institutions to kick people with these letter charges when borrowers are already down in the gutter .
i should add that i now view credit card companies as parasites and treat there invitations of credit with the utmost contempt. jon , uk know just how she feels .
i am in debt and hate it but with bills increasing every year but my salary staying the same it is impossible not to go into debt .
i just wish i could go out at least once a month to the pub for just one drink but its not an option , unfortunately mortgage , home insurance , council tax etc. come first .
people in jobs who earn more than the minimum wage and receive an annual increase no matter how small do not know how lucky they are .
sarah , uk i 've £ 4,000 debts solely due to the lack of temp work since autumn 2001 , my income being half what it was then .
i pay out £ 70 a month to cover insurance and interest , but it never comes down .
i have always lived on a shoestring although regret the lack of recent holidays .
i now have a business to develop with no money to invest or credit leeway to draw on .
in one way it is terrifying but here is where necessity really does become the mother of invention .
i will make my products at home , work part-time to pull in the rent and tackle these debts radically this year as they are bedevilling every aspect of my life .
joan , uk i think a lot of the problem is with the mindset of people - i have a friend who got a credit card with a £ 10,000 credit limit and saw it as him having £ 10,000 in his pocket to spend ! !
i myself have credit / store cards but never run up huge bills and pay what i owe at the end of each month - i resent paying interest .
if i ca n't afford it i do n't buy it - simple !
melanie , uk i do n't agree with nigel .
i earn £ 40k a year and have a secure job .
i have one car loan and i pay all my credit cards in full each month .
the reason i disagree with nigel is because one credit card company has just sent me a guaranteed loan offer of £ 20k -lrb- half my annual salary -rrb- and another credit card company has also sent me a guaranteed loan offer of £ 9k , just before christmas .
i work for a bank and am very sensible with money , but these kind of guaranteed offers are bordering insanity and of course they are going to encourage some people to over stretch themselves .
i think the problem is down to both the customer who over commits and the bank that over lends .
anyway there is some good news on the horizon as experian the main credit checking company in the uk is launching an indiviudal indebt index on every person in the uk so banks will be able to tell in an instant if a customer is over-stretched .
john , uk i moved into a new property .
my first house so i was quite naive and so didnt do the things i should have done like get my boiler serviced .
next thing i had a six month gas bill of over a thousand pounds .
there was no way i could afford to pay it and british gas were less than helpfull .
next welsh water wanted a years water up front .
before i knew it i couldnt even afford food .
i had overdrafts and credit cards piling up until at 19 years of age i had almost 4 grand of debt with all the charges .
i finally got a loan to consolodate and im on my way to paying it off .
what i learnt was that some companies are understanding until you can not pay their bills .
ian , wales as a family of four , we 've found our debts mounting since the children were born.we have a loan and credit cards which we are paying off at the moment .
i think credit companies are partly to blame for agressive advertising that promises your dream consumer goods / car etc-you can have it now , why wait .
however i agree that the responsibility lies with the credit user to think before " splashing the cash " .
carl , u.k , uk do you have a similar story to tell ?
how have you coped with the stigma of debt ?
are britons heading for a debt disaster ?

sarah from tyne & wear lived with debt for more than 15 years .
things started to go seriously wrong for her when her husband gave up work due to ill health in 1985 .
one of the worst things was having to say no to my kids at christmas sarah " it was a struggle but we were coping , then i fell pregnant and had to give up work for a while . "
when sarah turned to credit cards and loans to cover her existing borrowing , the slide into serious debt difficulties began . : debt ridden britain how much do we owe ?
" i was robbing peter to pay paul , " she admits .
christmas woe later , sarah was able to start her own small business and pay off some of her previous debt .
however , she was unaware that her husband was meanwhile siphoning off funds from the company and applying for new credit cards .
sarah found it most difficult at christmas time inevitably , the business folded , and sarah was devastated to discover that her husband had been taking out the credit cards in her name .
in short , when she finally asked her husband to leave in 1996 , sarah was left with debts of £ 13,500 and an annual income of just £ 8,500 a year from an office job .
" i did not know where to turn , " she said .
" one of the worst things was having to say no to my kids at christmas .
however , it brought us closer together in the end . "
debt management trap unaware that there was free advice available from charities such as the consumer credit counselling service or citizens advice , sarah tried a debt management firm .
people in debt feel a terrible stigma , it is heartbreaking sarah these companies promise to act as go-betweens between clients and their creditors .
" they gave me a budget which was helpful but they charged a fee and that money could and should have been used to pay off my debt . "
sarah has now got back on her feet after seeking advice from a leading debt charity .
in 2002 she became a homeowner and is now able to provide for her two children aged 16 and 11 .
stigma ironically , sarah now counsels other people with debts .
" it is good to help out - the problem is that people in debt feel a terrible stigma , it is heartbreaking .
" recently , i saw one 27 year old woman -lsb- who was -rsb- £ 40,000 in the red with no prospect of paying it back .
" i was the first person she had been able to speak to and she was very tearful indeed . "
debt race away although it has a happy ending sarah 's debt spiral story is far from unusual .
britons have spent the last decade piling up a debt mountain .
house-price falls will leave people feeling more exposed as far as their debts are concerned jonathan loynes capital economics although incomes are increasing , total debt as a percentage of average annual income has increased from 54 % in 1993 to 70 % in 2002 .
sarah says irresponsible lending is at the root of the uk debt explosion .
" lenders do not look at the overall financial position of people - asking can this person really afford more credit ?
" instead all they look at is if a person has kept to repayment plans in the past . "
house prices many economists say that borrowing in the uk has been made easier by low interest rates , near full employment and personal income outstripping inflation .
the housing boom has fuelled britain 's credit lust in addition , house-price rises mean that many people 's major asset - which they can borrow against - has been growing in value during recent years .
since 1988 debt has increased on average by 112 % while house prices have gone up by 141 % , according to a recent survey by the online bank egg .
but with the economy slowing and the property market - at least in london - running out of steam , many borrowers may be feeling under pressure .
' belt tightening ' jonathan loynes , chief economist at capital economics , told bbc news online that he expected house prices to fall 20 % during 2004 , leaving consumers with a bad-debt hangover .
" house-price falls will leave people feeling more exposed as far as their debts are concerned .
we will see a general belt tightening as people try to bring their debts under control . "
in the past , rising inflation eroded the value of personal debts , making them more manageable .
however , with inflation now so low , at about 2 % , it will take much longer for the debt to shrink in real terms .
as a result , many people could struggle , like sarah , to get on top of their debts .
your comments mum was a single parent bringing up three children and she managed to avoid such debt -lrb- without any state benefits i might add -rrb- .
obviously being made redundant is not something people can control , but there are such things as payment protection insurance which covers repayments in this eventuality .
if people are stupid enough to rack up so much debt with no means of paying it off then it 's their own fault .
there is no such thing as free money , and the sooner our money-crazy spending happy society realises this the better .
sd , uk it is the relentless pressure of modern society , especially at times like christmas , that persuades people to get into debt .
the endless offers of credit by finance companies and the pressure to have the latest fashions and products .
i was a single parent for 10 years and never gave in to it , as a result i am now debt free with my own house and am about to set up my own business .
the future is rosy and i 'll never be tempted to give in and buy things i do n't need and ca n't afford .
i 've seen too many friends go under , go bankrupt and sacrifice their futures - for what ?
louisa morgan , uk the single biggest problem behind this country 's debt-sustained economy is not just irresponsible lending and lack of consulation for each potential borrower - it 's the advertising methods used to hook people in the first place .
many satellite tv channels run back to back loan adverts every 15 minutes -lrb- it 's like brainwashing -rrb- , and all are either of the " why wait for a new car / holiday / home improvement " variety or , ironically , the " are you worried about debt - then take out a consolidation loan " type .
the sooner these companies stop shoving loans down the throats of those who ca n't really afford it the better ; and these adverts are preying on the hopes and dreams -lrb- and fears -rrb- of the nation -advertising standards should introduce rules for lenders. chris , uk i was in debt to the tune of £ 9,000 at the age of 19 as a result of living with a boyfriend for a year .
he did n't help to pay any of the bills so i had to , to make sure we had electricity , water and food .
i left when the lease ended and went back home to my parents for a year during which i paid the whole lot back .
it was miserable , i did n't go out or buy myself anything which was n't neccessary , so my only outgoings were food and rent .
i did n't tell my parents or friends about the debt because i was ashamed .
i lost 3 stones in weight and became a daily user of my local library as it was the only thing i could do for free !
i certainly learnt my lesson as 10 years on am i 'm still debt free .
i still have credit cards but i pay the entire amount off every month .
i do n't blame the credit card companies , i was the one that spent the money , i 'm just glad it was there for the taking as it made a hellish year much more bearable .
just remember , there is always light at the end of the ! tu ! nnel , even if you ca n't see it yet .
work out a budget and stick to it , write every little thing down that you spend money on , it really helps to see where you can make cutbacks , and do n't give up .
do n't take out loans to repay other debt and try to reduce your credit cards to just one that has a very low apr .
it may take one year , or five , and it will be hard , but you can do it and the quality of life you gain is absolutely worth it .
carrie , uk i left university over two and a half years ago having taken out my full quota of student loans .
during that time i have been working full time for a company in the city , i have yet to pay off that particualer debt and , thanks to the cost of living in london -lrb- rent , bills , food , transport costs -rrb- find that i now owe for a further two graduate loans -lrb- £ 6000 -rrb- and two credit cards -lrb- £ 6000 -rrb- .
i am not a big spender , i work pretty hard and yet i still seem to be permanantly in debt - i can not pursue the career i want until i 'm solvent - so am stuck in a job i do not enjoy .
it is like dragging around a huge ball and chain .
the banks just threw money at me after university -which was great at the time but i rue the day i ever signed on the line of my first graduate loan .
charlie , uk when i got my first job after leaving university , i got a credit card , and ran up a debt of £ 3000 .
things went from bad to worse and i 'm now £ 5000 in debt .
i too tried a debt management firm , but then found payplan , a company owned by a & l , who do n't charge a fee .
it will take me a while to pay it off .
in the meantime , i suffer from depression due to continuing phone calls from creditors .
darryl , england , uk i have run up £ 60,000 on credit cards and , quite frankly , i 'm terrified .
i have a decent paid job in london , but have no idea how i am going to pay it all back .
ranzar , uk with all respect to sarah , the root cause of the uk debt explosion is not irresponsible lending -lrb- indeed if such a thing was rife all lenders would quickly go out of business -rrb- .
individuals who borrow have to take responsibility for their own choices - i 'm afraid the responsibility lies solely with them .
nigel , uk i absolutely agree with sarah that irresponsible lending is the key to suffering , most notably by the big mortgage providers who have been the main drivers in this debt explosion both directly and indirectly .
the so-called " economists " employed by these companies will be exposed by the dramatic house price correction as at best ridiculously optimistic and at worst negligent in their forecast of house price growth , in the same way as stock analysts are now pilloried ruthless pawns of the investment banks .
the unforgiveable greed and arrogance of these institutions has left a legacy of suffering for normal people seduced by their flawed research .
so much for the abolition of boom and bust !
james , uk i was one of the naive millions who was promised a better life by going through university and completing my studies .
as the government refused to pay for one year i ended up turning to a bank to acquire a loan to complete my studies .
at the end of the studies , i spent almost 2 years searching for jobs and filling out 100s of applications forms .
i 'm now on a minimal salary job fighting to keep afloat with £ 15k of bank debts and approx £ 10k of student loans , despite the fact that my spending is very tight and not having credit cards .
mortgages ?
well i do n't think i would be able to saddle myself with another debt for some time !
and i see peers who never studied in he , and earn a lot more than i do , without the complication of debts .
dan a , uk when will people realise that in many cases it 's all about personal choice .
you choose to spend the money and therefore it 's up to you to pay it back .
it 's the same as the overweight people sueing mcdonalds , why do people have to have someone else to blame ?
nobody forces them to take the money , you can always say no .
if you ca n't then your own weakness leads you into debt .
do n't blame the lenders , blame the borrowers !
oj , england i agree that getting credit is all too easy , however i strongly believe that anyone borrowing heavily beyond their means must take responsibilty for their actions .
surely in many cases , it is pure greed and stupidity ?
advice : keep away from the high street stores and the pub until debts are paid !
andrew , uk i was £ 7,000 in debt at twenty after having credit cards and loans thrown at me by banks , although i do n't blame them , they are there to make profits .
after selling a house i managed to pay of some of the debts but still have around three thousand pounds owing three years later .
i am now in the lucky position that i live with my parents rent free which has allowed me to pay off alot more than i could have any other way .
i did try a debt management firm at one point , but instead of helping i ended up with a ccj and most of my debts with debt collection agencies .
currently i have a very bad credit rating and will do for a few years now , which i am quite happy about as it will stop me starting the spiral all over again .
it is all to do with willpower , i did n't have any when i was younger , hopefully now i have ! and wo n't end up in that mess again .
michelle , uk i have been in debt now ever since i started work when i was 17 , over 10 years now .
all thanks to my parent persuading me to get finance on a car i didn ¿ t even really want .
i have never been able to get on top of my debts as one debt creates another debt .
you are always short of money while just trying to make ends meet .
the problem has got so bad i have even considered giving up work as i have hardly seen anything of my wages for all my working life .
the solution is simple , just live out of your pocket from the start .
if you have n't got the cash , then you ca n't buy .
you will be far richer in the end .
charlie sweetman , london , uk i have just made my last repayment on my final loan .
at one point i reached over £ 21,000 worth of debt , the majority of which i built up during my university years .
the best advice i can offer is to consolidate all your debts and shop about for the best deal on a loan - it worked for me .
james , uk many people these days expect to be able to live out a certain lifestyle -lrb- as seen on tv -rrb- regardless of whether or not they can afford it .
credit cards , personal loans and automatic bank overdrafts offer a huge temptation to live now and pay later .
many years ago i borrowed money to buy a car .
the loan was reasonable but close to the time of the final payment i received an offer of a further loan .
it was tempting to receive another few thousand pounds and continue with similar monthly payments .
the trouble with this sort of " sustainable debt " is that any further demands on my funds maight cause me to slip into serious debt .
i ca n't believe how sneaky and predatory some tv adverts are when they target those in debt .
i saw one recently where a woman meets a friend in a supermarket car park loading heaps of shopping into a brand new car .
her friend explains that she has " consolidated her debts into one easy single payment " and now has enough over to splash out on a car !
basically she has borrowed enough money to pay off her debts .
that idea used to be a joke !
andy kelly , uk with little or no parental or other support , many students will have to turn to loans to support their education .
then after their course , they may need to take a graduate loan to actually move to a new job , buy decent clothes etc .
a graduate 's first job is probably not going to be highly paid , and therefore a signficant impact on reducing the loans borrowed is n't going to occur for some time .
this is exactly the path i took , and of course i wish i did n't take the loans , but to survive i had no choice .
to get a good future through education , it was necessary to become in debt .
luckily , buying a flat -lrb- 100 % mortgage funnily enough -rrb- and its increasing value has given me some relief as there is capital tied up in it that can pay off those loans if i choose to. ben , uk it 's sad and difficult for people when things go wrong and you have to provide for your family , but i think that a lot of debt is also people who simply want things they ca n't have .
blaming the lenders in this case is wrong .
john ladd , uk personally , i do n't borrow anymore , simply because i got sick of paying £ 25 for bank computer generated letters .
it simply should n't be allowed for financial institutions to kick people with these letter charges when borrowers are already down in the gutter .
i should add that i now view credit card companies as parasites and treat there invitations of credit with the utmost contempt. jon , uk know just how she feels .
i am in debt and hate it but with bills increasing every year but my salary staying the same it is impossible not to go into debt .
i just wish i could go out at least once a month to the pub for just one drink but its not an option , unfortunately mortgage , home insurance , council tax etc. come first .
people in jobs who earn more than the minimum wage and receive an annual increase no matter how small do not know how lucky they are .
sarah , uk i 've £ 4,000 debts solely due to the lack of temp work since autumn 2001 , my income being half what it was then .
i pay out £ 70 a month to cover insurance and interest , but it never comes down .
i have always lived on a shoestring although regret the lack of recent holidays .
i now have a business to develop with no money to invest or credit leeway to draw on .
in one way it is terrifying but here is where necessity really does become the mother of invention .
i will make my products at home , work part-time to pull in the rent and tackle these debts radically this year as they are bedevilling every aspect of my life .
joan , uk i think a lot of the problem is with the mindset of people - i have a friend who got a credit card with a £ 10,000 credit limit and saw it as him having £ 10,000 in his pocket to spend ! !
i myself have credit / store cards but never run up huge bills and pay what i owe at the end of each month - i resent paying interest .
if i ca n't afford it i do n't buy it - simple !
melanie , uk i do n't agree with nigel .
i earn £ 40k a year and have a secure job .
i have one car loan and i pay all my credit cards in full each month .
the reason i disagree with nigel is because one credit card company has just sent me a guaranteed loan offer of £ 20k -lrb- half my annual salary -rrb- and another credit card company has also sent me a guaranteed loan offer of £ 9k , just before christmas .
i work for a bank and am very sensible with money , but these kind of guaranteed offers are bordering insanity and of course they are going to encourage some people to over stretch themselves .
i think the problem is down to both the customer who over commits and the bank that over lends .
anyway there is some good news on the horizon as experian the main credit checking company in the uk is launching an indiviudal indebt index on every person in the uk so banks will be able to tell in an instant if a customer is over-stretched .
john , uk i moved into a new property .
my first house so i was quite naive and so didnt do the things i should have done like get my boiler serviced .
next thing i had a six month gas bill of over a thousand pounds .
there was no way i could afford to pay it and british gas were less than helpfull .
next welsh water wanted a years water up front .
before i knew it i couldnt even afford food .
i had overdrafts and credit cards piling up until at 19 years of age i had almost 4 grand of debt with all the charges .
i finally got a loan to consolodate and im on my way to paying it off .
what i learnt was that some companies are understanding until you can not pay their bills .
ian , wales as a family of four , we 've found our debts mounting since the children were born.we have a loan and credit cards which we are paying off at the moment .
i think credit companies are partly to blame for agressive advertising that promises your dream consumer goods / car etc-you can have it now , why wait .
however i agree that the responsibility lies with the credit user to think before " splashing the cash " .

nearly 100,000 young people in ten parts of the uk took part last summer in splash extra , which received £ 9m of lottery money .
the scheme gives youngsters the chance to take part in activities such as drama , abseiling , circus skills and making videos and rap music .
culture secretary tessa jowell said robbery and street crime had fallen by an average of 5.2 % in these areas .
the link between activities and crime is being debated and in avon and somerset , it had fallen by 31 % in parts of the region where splash extra was held , and risen by 56 % where it had not .
ms jowell said : " splash extra is about getting young people off the sofas - and off the streets - and showing them that there are productive and enjoyable ways they can spend their time .
" it is also about giving them experiences that many children in more wealthy areas take for granted .
" the young people 's appetite for this kind of positive experience is shown by the numbers that participated .
if we show these young people a better alternative to crime and anti-social behaviour now , we should see a marked improvement for these high crime areas in the future lord warner youth justice board " summer splash is clearly good for those who take part , but it is also good for those they live with and the community they live within . "
she now wants to extend the scheme to other areas .
splash extra has been running for the past three summers but last year , there were twice as many participants than expected .
there were 296 schemes , which targeted children and young people aged nine to 17 who were identified as being at risk of offending .
improvement lord warner , chairman of the youth justice board , also backed the scheme 's effectiveness .
he said : " many areas with little provision for young people were transformed by the projects last summer with residents , police and the young people themselves seeing a real improvement in youth crime and anti-social behaviour .
" if we show these young people a better alternative to crime and anti-social behaviour now , we should see a marked improvement for these high crime areas in the future as well as the youth justice system as a whole . "
