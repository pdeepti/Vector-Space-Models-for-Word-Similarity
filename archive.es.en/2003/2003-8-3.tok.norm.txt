germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke . depending upon what side of the cigarette you ’ re on , germany can either be a nicotine nirvana , or a smoke-filled purgatory .
that ’ s because unlike in the united states and many european countries , german smokers still have free reign in many public spaces . whereas smokers in new york or california face an absolute ban on smoking in bars , restaurants and elsewhere , ending smoking in offices or designating non-smoking areas in restaurants is a fairly new phenomenon to germany , a country where roughly a third of the population puffs away daily . but germany ’ s reputation as a cigarette-friendly nation could soon change if a new anti-smoking drive takes off .
marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , on sunday reportedly said she wanted to soon take the first steps to better protect non-smokers . “ not smoking in public has to become what ’ s considered normal , ” she told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview .
“ it has to become the standard that restaurants have non-smoking areas . ” any new anti-smoking initiative would come on the heels of the government ’ s recent decision to hike the price of a pack of cigarettes by a euro over the next couple of years to help pay for health care costs .
taken together , many german smokers could be forgiven for thinking the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens were planning a coming anti-smoking crusade in germany . vending machines on the corner but any truly draconian non-smoking measures like those in the united states are likely a long way off in germany , a country which ostensibly requires people to be 16 to buy tobacco , yet has freely available cigarette vending machines outdoors on nearly every corner of any major city . still , capers-merk call to further restrict smoking – including making hospitals , schools and government buildings completely smoke free – was positively received by some politicians from the conservative opposition .
bavarian health minister eberhard sinner told the paper smoking was a “ war against good health , especially that of our children . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke ' em now if you got ' em .
“ my goal is society a free from smoke as possible .
that ’ s what i ’ d like to convince people .
if persuasion doesn ’ t work than one has to think about an appropriate ban , ” sinner said . other politicians made no secret that they saw the strict no smoking policies of the united states as the example germany needed to follow .
werner lensing , a christian democrat member of the north-rhine westphalia state parliament , urged for legislation modelled on american laws forbidding smoking in public places . “ i ’ m for a total smoking ban everywhere where non-smokers can ’ t avoid cigarette smoke – namely pubs and also in office buildings , ” lensing told bild . the president of a private non-smoker initiative ekkehard schulz said it was no longer reasonable to expect people to put up with secondhand smoke in german restaurants . “ the americans are pioneers in this area .

germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke . depending upon what side of the cigarette you ’ re on , germany can either be a nicotine nirvana , or a smoke-filled purgatory .

marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , on sunday reportedly said she wanted to soon take the first steps to better protect non-smokers . “ not smoking in public has to become what ’ s considered normal , ” she told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview .
“ it has to become the standard that restaurants have non-smoking areas . ” any new anti-smoking initiative would come on the heels of the government ’ s recent decision to hike the price of a pack of cigarettes by a euro over the next couple of years to help pay for health care costs .

the german bundesliga started this weekened with current champions bayern munich easily dominating newly promoted eintracht frankfurt .
some pundits are already predicting another bayern title this season . it ’ s a foolish person who says the championship is over before it has begun , but it would be a brave one who puts money on any club other than bayern munich for this season ’ s bundesliga title .
the german top flight soccer league kicked this weekend with the champions trouncing recently promoted eintracht frankfurt 3-1 .
the dominating play bayern showed makes it a safe bet that the bavarian giants will win record-breaking 19th bundesliga championship this season .
however , those two teams aside , there are 16 other clubs in the league and , as the season starts its 40th year , there are plenty of strong sides gunning for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let go , ottmar ... give someone else a turn .
most experts in the german game , including 14 of the 18 coaches who were surveyed on this season ’ s outcome , say the championship trophy is likely to stay firmly in the hands of bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn and his teammates .
although bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld refrained from investing heavily in new players , an established squad including german player of the year michael ballack , last season ’ s joint top scorer giovanni elber of brazil and sebastian deisler , the most coveted young player in the league , should remain strong enough to snatch the honors yet again .
a rival for the cup ?
their nearest rivals could once more be borussia dortmund .
unseated as champions last april when bayern opened up a title-winning 16-point gap , dortmund will be keen to at least keep in touch with their fierce rivals this time .
but the loss of goalkeeper jens lehmann to arsenal london and long-term injuries to germany ’ s international defender thorsten frings and brazilian evanilson could leave bvb lacking depth in the long run .
on saturday , dortmund had to fight back from a two goal deficit to draw with ruhr valley rival schalke 04 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's michael preetz , left , will hope berlin improve on 5th .
both schalke and hertha berlin could also make a run for the championship if dortmund lags this season .
schalke ’ s new coach jupp heynckes knows a thing or two about glory .
a european cup winning coach with spanish giants real madrid back in 1998 , heynckes will no doubt have a few tricks up his sleeve .
but with a similar line up to last time and an aging defense , schalke looks like a team destined to underachieve again .
berlin has never finished lower than sixth place in the bundesliga and with new faces on board to strengthen a weak offense , it ’ s likely they will be seated thereabouts again this season . hertha , however , suffered a humiliating start to the season , losing 3-0 at home to werder bremen . first in fashion last season ’ s surprise package vfb stuttgart finished an amazing second and grabbed themselves a champions league spot .
however , with mounting debts and rising expectation , the club may find it hard to emulate their best season in years .
they will at least be challenging for the title in one of the more fashionable shirts in the bundesliga , if the league allows the sleeveless puma design an airing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen need to recover quickly from last season 's shocker .
third tier challenges may come in the form of werder bremen and bayer leverkusen .
three time german champions bremen have been a consistent top six side over the last two seasons and will be hoping to improve on that while ailing leverkusen will hope to put the shock of their relegation escape behind them to improve on may ’ s 15th place finish .
coach claus augenthaler knows his players suffered but , on paper at least , leverkusen has one of the strongest squads in the league .
augenthaler will be hoping for a quick recovery to mount a serious challenge .
for their opening match , leverkusen managed a strong 4-1 win against the promoted sc freiburg .
up and down the tables the mid-table line-up is likely to remain the same although finishing positions will be hard to predict .
the likes of kaiserslautern , hanover 96 , vfl wolfsburg , hamburg sv , 1860 munich , borussia moechengladbach and vfl bochum may continue to unspectacularly fill up the table .
bochum however , nicknamed the elevators because of their relegation / promotion tendencies , may be entertaining one of the lower spots reserved for clubs going down the line-up after losing their sensational striker thomas christiansen to hanover .
money status bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas cichon takes his scoring exploits for cologne into the big league .
the top league offers much to the newly promoted and smaller sides , but time spent away from the money of the bundesliga can immediately put such a club at a disadvantage .
funds for new players may be a lot lower than the other more wealthy or established competitors and this can manifest itself as a season long struggle to keep top league status .
sc freiburg , fc köln , hansa rostock and eintracht frankfurt are expected to be engaged in their own fight throughout this season – a fight to stay away from the final three places that signal second division soccer in 2004/05 .
international attention will mostly be focused on the other end of the league .
despite the on-going wrangle over television rights , the new bundesliga season will be aired as usual on both cable and terrestrial tv from friday night .
matches will once again be covered live on radio stations throughout germany .
bundesliga fans in china will also be privileged to exclusive coverage through deutsche welle ’ s chinese online portal which will be streaming matches and commentary from the first to the last kick of the ball .
so , wherever you may be , whoever you support , whatever medium you use to follow it – there ’ s no escaping the fact .

however , those two teams aside , there are 16 other clubs in the league and , as the season starts its 40th year , there are plenty of strong sides gunning for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let go , ottmar ... give someone else a turn .
most experts in the german game , including 14 of the 18 coaches who were surveyed on this season ’ s outcome , say the championship trophy is likely to stay firmly in the hands of bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn and his teammates .
although bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld refrained from investing heavily in new players , an established squad including german player of the year michael ballack , last season ’ s joint top scorer giovanni elber of brazil and sebastian deisler , the most coveted young player in the league , should remain strong enough to snatch the honors yet again .

their nearest rivals could once more be borussia dortmund .

third tier challenges may come in the form of werder bremen and bayer leverkusen .

augenthaler will be hoping for a quick recovery to mount a serious challenge .
for their opening match , leverkusen managed a strong 4-1 win against the promoted sc freiburg .
up and down the tables the mid-table line-up is likely to remain the same although finishing positions will be hard to predict .
the likes of kaiserslautern , hanover 96 , vfl wolfsburg , hamburg sv , 1860 munich , borussia moechengladbach and vfl bochum may continue to unspectacularly fill up the table .
bochum however , nicknamed the elevators because of their relegation / promotion tendencies , may be entertaining one of the lower spots reserved for clubs going down the line-up after losing their sensational striker thomas christiansen to hanover .

funds for new players may be a lot lower than the other more wealthy or established competitors and this can manifest itself as a season long struggle to keep top league status .
sc freiburg , fc köln , hansa rostock and eintracht frankfurt are expected to be engaged in their own fight throughout this season – a fight to stay away from the final three places that signal second division soccer in 2004/05 .

money status bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas cichon takes his scoring exploits for cologne into the big league .
the top league offers much to the newly promoted and smaller sides , but time spent away from the money of the bundesliga can immediately put such a club at a disadvantage .
funds for new players may be a lot lower than the other more wealthy or established competitors and this can manifest itself as a season long struggle to keep top league status .
sc freiburg , fc köln , hansa rostock and eintracht frankfurt are expected to be engaged in their own fight throughout this season – a fight to stay away from the final three places that signal second division soccer in 2004/05 .
international attention will mostly be focused on the other end of the league .
despite the on-going wrangle over television rights , the new bundesliga season will be aired as usual on both cable and terrestrial tv from friday night .
matches will once again be covered live on radio stations throughout germany .
bundesliga fans in china will also be privileged to exclusive coverage through deutsche welle ’ s chinese online portal which will be streaming matches and commentary from the first to the last kick of the ball .
so , wherever you may be , whoever you support , whatever medium you use to follow it – there ’ s no escaping the fact .

germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke . depending upon what side of the cigarette you ’ re on , germany can either be a nicotine nirvana , or a smoke-filled purgatory .
that ’ s because unlike in the united states and many european countries , german smokers still have free reign in many public spaces . whereas smokers in new york or california face an absolute ban on smoking in bars , restaurants and elsewhere , ending smoking in offices or designating non-smoking areas in restaurants is a fairly new phenomenon to germany , a country where roughly a third of the population puffs away daily . but germany ’ s reputation as a cigarette-friendly nation could soon change if a new anti-smoking drive takes off .
marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , on sunday reportedly said she wanted to soon take the first steps to better protect non-smokers . “ not smoking in public has to become what ’ s considered normal , ” she told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview .
“ it has to become the standard that restaurants have non-smoking areas . ” any new anti-smoking initiative would come on the heels of the government ’ s recent decision to hike the price of a pack of cigarettes by a euro over the next couple of years to help pay for health care costs .
taken together , many german smokers could be forgiven for thinking the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens were planning a coming anti-smoking crusade in germany . vending machines on the corner but any truly draconian non-smoking measures like those in the united states are likely a long way off in germany , a country which ostensibly requires people to be 16 to buy tobacco , yet has freely available cigarette vending machines outdoors on nearly every corner of any major city . still , capers-merk call to further restrict smoking – including making hospitals , schools and government buildings completely smoke free – was positively received by some politicians from the conservative opposition .

the german bundesliga started this weekened with current champions bayern munich easily dominating newly promoted eintracht frankfurt .
some pundits are already predicting another bayern title this season . it ’ s a foolish person who says the championship is over before it has begun , but it would be a brave one who puts money on any club other than bayern munich for this season ’ s bundesliga title .
the german top flight soccer league kicked this weekend with the champions trouncing recently promoted eintracht frankfurt 3-1 .

most experts in the german game , including 14 of the 18 coaches who were surveyed on this season ’ s outcome , say the championship trophy is likely to stay firmly in the hands of bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn and his teammates .
although bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld refrained from investing heavily in new players , an established squad including german player of the year michael ballack , last season ’ s joint top scorer giovanni elber of brazil and sebastian deisler , the most coveted young player in the league , should remain strong enough to snatch the honors yet again .

the german bundesliga started this weekened with current champions bayern munich easily dominating newly promoted eintracht frankfurt .
some pundits are already predicting another bayern title this season . it ’ s a foolish person who says the championship is over before it has begun , but it would be a brave one who puts money on any club other than bayern munich for this season ’ s bundesliga title .
the german top flight soccer league kicked this weekend with the champions trouncing recently promoted eintracht frankfurt 3-1 .
the dominating play bayern showed makes it a safe bet that the bavarian giants will win record-breaking 19th bundesliga championship this season .
however , those two teams aside , there are 16 other clubs in the league and , as the season starts its 40th year , there are plenty of strong sides gunning for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let go , ottmar ... give someone else a turn .
most experts in the german game , including 14 of the 18 coaches who were surveyed on this season ’ s outcome , say the championship trophy is likely to stay firmly in the hands of bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn and his teammates .
although bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld refrained from investing heavily in new players , an established squad including german player of the year michael ballack , last season ’ s joint top scorer giovanni elber of brazil and sebastian deisler , the most coveted young player in the league , should remain strong enough to snatch the honors yet again .
a rival for the cup ?
their nearest rivals could once more be borussia dortmund .
unseated as champions last april when bayern opened up a title-winning 16-point gap , dortmund will be keen to at least keep in touch with their fierce rivals this time .
but the loss of goalkeeper jens lehmann to arsenal london and long-term injuries to germany ’ s international defender thorsten frings and brazilian evanilson could leave bvb lacking depth in the long run .
on saturday , dortmund had to fight back from a two goal deficit to draw with ruhr valley rival schalke 04 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's michael preetz , left , will hope berlin improve on 5th .
both schalke and hertha berlin could also make a run for the championship if dortmund lags this season .
schalke ’ s new coach jupp heynckes knows a thing or two about glory .
a european cup winning coach with spanish giants real madrid back in 1998 , heynckes will no doubt have a few tricks up his sleeve .
but with a similar line up to last time and an aging defense , schalke looks like a team destined to underachieve again .
berlin has never finished lower than sixth place in the bundesliga and with new faces on board to strengthen a weak offense , it ’ s likely they will be seated thereabouts again this season . hertha , however , suffered a humiliating start to the season , losing 3-0 at home to werder bremen . first in fashion last season ’ s surprise package vfb stuttgart finished an amazing second and grabbed themselves a champions league spot .
however , with mounting debts and rising expectation , the club may find it hard to emulate their best season in years .
they will at least be challenging for the title in one of the more fashionable shirts in the bundesliga , if the league allows the sleeveless puma design an airing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen need to recover quickly from last season 's shocker .
third tier challenges may come in the form of werder bremen and bayer leverkusen .
three time german champions bremen have been a consistent top six side over the last two seasons and will be hoping to improve on that while ailing leverkusen will hope to put the shock of their relegation escape behind them to improve on may ’ s 15th place finish .
coach claus augenthaler knows his players suffered but , on paper at least , leverkusen has one of the strongest squads in the league .
augenthaler will be hoping for a quick recovery to mount a serious challenge .
for their opening match , leverkusen managed a strong 4-1 win against the promoted sc freiburg .
up and down the tables the mid-table line-up is likely to remain the same although finishing positions will be hard to predict .
the likes of kaiserslautern , hanover 96 , vfl wolfsburg , hamburg sv , 1860 munich , borussia moechengladbach and vfl bochum may continue to unspectacularly fill up the table .
bochum however , nicknamed the elevators because of their relegation / promotion tendencies , may be entertaining one of the lower spots reserved for clubs going down the line-up after losing their sensational striker thomas christiansen to hanover .
money status bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas cichon takes his scoring exploits for cologne into the big league .
the top league offers much to the newly promoted and smaller sides , but time spent away from the money of the bundesliga can immediately put such a club at a disadvantage .
funds for new players may be a lot lower than the other more wealthy or established competitors and this can manifest itself as a season long struggle to keep top league status .
sc freiburg , fc köln , hansa rostock and eintracht frankfurt are expected to be engaged in their own fight throughout this season – a fight to stay away from the final three places that signal second division soccer in 2004/05 .
international attention will mostly be focused on the other end of the league .
despite the on-going wrangle over television rights , the new bundesliga season will be aired as usual on both cable and terrestrial tv from friday night .
matches will once again be covered live on radio stations throughout germany .

the german bundesliga started this weekened with current champions bayern munich easily dominating newly promoted eintracht frankfurt .
some pundits are already predicting another bayern title this season . it ’ s a foolish person who says the championship is over before it has begun , but it would be a brave one who puts money on any club other than bayern munich for this season ’ s bundesliga title .
the german top flight soccer league kicked this weekend with the champions trouncing recently promoted eintracht frankfurt 3-1 .
the dominating play bayern showed makes it a safe bet that the bavarian giants will win record-breaking 19th bundesliga championship this season .
however , those two teams aside , there are 16 other clubs in the league and , as the season starts its 40th year , there are plenty of strong sides gunning for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let go , ottmar ... give someone else a turn .
most experts in the german game , including 14 of the 18 coaches who were surveyed on this season ’ s outcome , say the championship trophy is likely to stay firmly in the hands of bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn and his teammates .
although bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld refrained from investing heavily in new players , an established squad including german player of the year michael ballack , last season ’ s joint top scorer giovanni elber of brazil and sebastian deisler , the most coveted young player in the league , should remain strong enough to snatch the honors yet again .
a rival for the cup ?
their nearest rivals could once more be borussia dortmund .
unseated as champions last april when bayern opened up a title-winning 16-point gap , dortmund will be keen to at least keep in touch with their fierce rivals this time .
but the loss of goalkeeper jens lehmann to arsenal london and long-term injuries to germany ’ s international defender thorsten frings and brazilian evanilson could leave bvb lacking depth in the long run .
on saturday , dortmund had to fight back from a two goal deficit to draw with ruhr valley rival schalke 04 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's michael preetz , left , will hope berlin improve on 5th .
both schalke and hertha berlin could also make a run for the championship if dortmund lags this season .
schalke ’ s new coach jupp heynckes knows a thing or two about glory .
a european cup winning coach with spanish giants real madrid back in 1998 , heynckes will no doubt have a few tricks up his sleeve .
but with a similar line up to last time and an aging defense , schalke looks like a team destined to underachieve again .
berlin has never finished lower than sixth place in the bundesliga and with new faces on board to strengthen a weak offense , it ’ s likely they will be seated thereabouts again this season . hertha , however , suffered a humiliating start to the season , losing 3-0 at home to werder bremen . first in fashion last season ’ s surprise package vfb stuttgart finished an amazing second and grabbed themselves a champions league spot .
however , with mounting debts and rising expectation , the club may find it hard to emulate their best season in years .
they will at least be challenging for the title in one of the more fashionable shirts in the bundesliga , if the league allows the sleeveless puma design an airing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen need to recover quickly from last season 's shocker .
third tier challenges may come in the form of werder bremen and bayer leverkusen .
three time german champions bremen have been a consistent top six side over the last two seasons and will be hoping to improve on that while ailing leverkusen will hope to put the shock of their relegation escape behind them to improve on may ’ s 15th place finish .
coach claus augenthaler knows his players suffered but , on paper at least , leverkusen has one of the strongest squads in the league .
augenthaler will be hoping for a quick recovery to mount a serious challenge .
for their opening match , leverkusen managed a strong 4-1 win against the promoted sc freiburg .
up and down the tables the mid-table line-up is likely to remain the same although finishing positions will be hard to predict .
the likes of kaiserslautern , hanover 96 , vfl wolfsburg , hamburg sv , 1860 munich , borussia moechengladbach and vfl bochum may continue to unspectacularly fill up the table .
bochum however , nicknamed the elevators because of their relegation / promotion tendencies , may be entertaining one of the lower spots reserved for clubs going down the line-up after losing their sensational striker thomas christiansen to hanover .
money status bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas cichon takes his scoring exploits for cologne into the big league .
the top league offers much to the newly promoted and smaller sides , but time spent away from the money of the bundesliga can immediately put such a club at a disadvantage .
funds for new players may be a lot lower than the other more wealthy or established competitors and this can manifest itself as a season long struggle to keep top league status .
sc freiburg , fc köln , hansa rostock and eintracht frankfurt are expected to be engaged in their own fight throughout this season – a fight to stay away from the final three places that signal second division soccer in 2004/05 .
international attention will mostly be focused on the other end of the league .
despite the on-going wrangle over television rights , the new bundesliga season will be aired as usual on both cable and terrestrial tv from friday night .
matches will once again be covered live on radio stations throughout germany .
bundesliga fans in china will also be privileged to exclusive coverage through deutsche welle ’ s chinese online portal which will be streaming matches and commentary from the first to the last kick of the ball .

the german bundesliga started this weekened with current champions bayern munich easily dominating newly promoted eintracht frankfurt .
some pundits are already predicting another bayern title this season . it ’ s a foolish person who says the championship is over before it has begun , but it would be a brave one who puts money on any club other than bayern munich for this season ’ s bundesliga title .
the german top flight soccer league kicked this weekend with the champions trouncing recently promoted eintracht frankfurt 3-1 .
the dominating play bayern showed makes it a safe bet that the bavarian giants will win record-breaking 19th bundesliga championship this season .
however , those two teams aside , there are 16 other clubs in the league and , as the season starts its 40th year , there are plenty of strong sides gunning for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let go , ottmar ... give someone else a turn .
most experts in the german game , including 14 of the 18 coaches who were surveyed on this season ’ s outcome , say the championship trophy is likely to stay firmly in the hands of bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn and his teammates .
although bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld refrained from investing heavily in new players , an established squad including german player of the year michael ballack , last season ’ s joint top scorer giovanni elber of brazil and sebastian deisler , the most coveted young player in the league , should remain strong enough to snatch the honors yet again .
a rival for the cup ?
their nearest rivals could once more be borussia dortmund .
unseated as champions last april when bayern opened up a title-winning 16-point gap , dortmund will be keen to at least keep in touch with their fierce rivals this time .
but the loss of goalkeeper jens lehmann to arsenal london and long-term injuries to germany ’ s international defender thorsten frings and brazilian evanilson could leave bvb lacking depth in the long run .

the german bundesliga started this weekened with current champions bayern munich easily dominating newly promoted eintracht frankfurt .
some pundits are already predicting another bayern title this season . it ’ s a foolish person who says the championship is over before it has begun , but it would be a brave one who puts money on any club other than bayern munich for this season ’ s bundesliga title .
the german top flight soccer league kicked this weekend with the champions trouncing recently promoted eintracht frankfurt 3-1 .
the dominating play bayern showed makes it a safe bet that the bavarian giants will win record-breaking 19th bundesliga championship this season .
however , those two teams aside , there are 16 other clubs in the league and , as the season starts its 40th year , there are plenty of strong sides gunning for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let go , ottmar ... give someone else a turn .
most experts in the german game , including 14 of the 18 coaches who were surveyed on this season ’ s outcome , say the championship trophy is likely to stay firmly in the hands of bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn and his teammates .
although bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld refrained from investing heavily in new players , an established squad including german player of the year michael ballack , last season ’ s joint top scorer giovanni elber of brazil and sebastian deisler , the most coveted young player in the league , should remain strong enough to snatch the honors yet again .
a rival for the cup ?
their nearest rivals could once more be borussia dortmund .
unseated as champions last april when bayern opened up a title-winning 16-point gap , dortmund will be keen to at least keep in touch with their fierce rivals this time .
but the loss of goalkeeper jens lehmann to arsenal london and long-term injuries to germany ’ s international defender thorsten frings and brazilian evanilson could leave bvb lacking depth in the long run .
on saturday , dortmund had to fight back from a two goal deficit to draw with ruhr valley rival schalke 04 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's michael preetz , left , will hope berlin improve on 5th .
both schalke and hertha berlin could also make a run for the championship if dortmund lags this season .
schalke ’ s new coach jupp heynckes knows a thing or two about glory .
a european cup winning coach with spanish giants real madrid back in 1998 , heynckes will no doubt have a few tricks up his sleeve .
but with a similar line up to last time and an aging defense , schalke looks like a team destined to underachieve again .
berlin has never finished lower than sixth place in the bundesliga and with new faces on board to strengthen a weak offense , it ’ s likely they will be seated thereabouts again this season . hertha , however , suffered a humiliating start to the season , losing 3-0 at home to werder bremen . first in fashion last season ’ s surprise package vfb stuttgart finished an amazing second and grabbed themselves a champions league spot .
however , with mounting debts and rising expectation , the club may find it hard to emulate their best season in years .
they will at least be challenging for the title in one of the more fashionable shirts in the bundesliga , if the league allows the sleeveless puma design an airing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen need to recover quickly from last season 's shocker .
third tier challenges may come in the form of werder bremen and bayer leverkusen .
three time german champions bremen have been a consistent top six side over the last two seasons and will be hoping to improve on that while ailing leverkusen will hope to put the shock of their relegation escape behind them to improve on may ’ s 15th place finish .
coach claus augenthaler knows his players suffered but , on paper at least , leverkusen has one of the strongest squads in the league .
augenthaler will be hoping for a quick recovery to mount a serious challenge .
for their opening match , leverkusen managed a strong 4-1 win against the promoted sc freiburg .
up and down the tables the mid-table line-up is likely to remain the same although finishing positions will be hard to predict .
the likes of kaiserslautern , hanover 96 , vfl wolfsburg , hamburg sv , 1860 munich , borussia moechengladbach and vfl bochum may continue to unspectacularly fill up the table .
bochum however , nicknamed the elevators because of their relegation / promotion tendencies , may be entertaining one of the lower spots reserved for clubs going down the line-up after losing their sensational striker thomas christiansen to hanover .
money status bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas cichon takes his scoring exploits for cologne into the big league .
the top league offers much to the newly promoted and smaller sides , but time spent away from the money of the bundesliga can immediately put such a club at a disadvantage .
funds for new players may be a lot lower than the other more wealthy or established competitors and this can manifest itself as a season long struggle to keep top league status .
sc freiburg , fc köln , hansa rostock and eintracht frankfurt are expected to be engaged in their own fight throughout this season – a fight to stay away from the final three places that signal second division soccer in 2004/05 .
international attention will mostly be focused on the other end of the league .
despite the on-going wrangle over television rights , the new bundesliga season will be aired as usual on both cable and terrestrial tv from friday night .
matches will once again be covered live on radio stations throughout germany .
bundesliga fans in china will also be privileged to exclusive coverage through deutsche welle ’ s chinese online portal which will be streaming matches and commentary from the first to the last kick of the ball .

germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke . depending upon what side of the cigarette you ’ re on , germany can either be a nicotine nirvana , or a smoke-filled purgatory .
that ’ s because unlike in the united states and many european countries , german smokers still have free reign in many public spaces . whereas smokers in new york or california face an absolute ban on smoking in bars , restaurants and elsewhere , ending smoking in offices or designating non-smoking areas in restaurants is a fairly new phenomenon to germany , a country where roughly a third of the population puffs away daily . but germany ’ s reputation as a cigarette-friendly nation could soon change if a new anti-smoking drive takes off .
marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , on sunday reportedly said she wanted to soon take the first steps to better protect non-smokers . “ not smoking in public has to become what ’ s considered normal , ” she told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview .
“ it has to become the standard that restaurants have non-smoking areas . ” any new anti-smoking initiative would come on the heels of the government ’ s recent decision to hike the price of a pack of cigarettes by a euro over the next couple of years to help pay for health care costs .
taken together , many german smokers could be forgiven for thinking the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens were planning a coming anti-smoking crusade in germany . vending machines on the corner but any truly draconian non-smoking measures like those in the united states are likely a long way off in germany , a country which ostensibly requires people to be 16 to buy tobacco , yet has freely available cigarette vending machines outdoors on nearly every corner of any major city . still , capers-merk call to further restrict smoking – including making hospitals , schools and government buildings completely smoke free – was positively received by some politicians from the conservative opposition .

that ’ s because unlike in the united states and many european countries , german smokers still have free reign in many public spaces . whereas smokers in new york or california face an absolute ban on smoking in bars , restaurants and elsewhere , ending smoking in offices or designating non-smoking areas in restaurants is a fairly new phenomenon to germany , a country where roughly a third of the population puffs away daily . but germany ’ s reputation as a cigarette-friendly nation could soon change if a new anti-smoking drive takes off .
marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , on sunday reportedly said she wanted to soon take the first steps to better protect non-smokers . “ not smoking in public has to become what ’ s considered normal , ” she told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview .
“ it has to become the standard that restaurants have non-smoking areas . ” any new anti-smoking initiative would come on the heels of the government ’ s recent decision to hike the price of a pack of cigarettes by a euro over the next couple of years to help pay for health care costs .
taken together , many german smokers could be forgiven for thinking the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens were planning a coming anti-smoking crusade in germany . vending machines on the corner but any truly draconian non-smoking measures like those in the united states are likely a long way off in germany , a country which ostensibly requires people to be 16 to buy tobacco , yet has freely available cigarette vending machines outdoors on nearly every corner of any major city . still , capers-merk call to further restrict smoking – including making hospitals , schools and government buildings completely smoke free – was positively received by some politicians from the conservative opposition .

the german bundesliga started this weekened with current champions bayern munich easily dominating newly promoted eintracht frankfurt .
some pundits are already predicting another bayern title this season . it ’ s a foolish person who says the championship is over before it has begun , but it would be a brave one who puts money on any club other than bayern munich for this season ’ s bundesliga title .
the german top flight soccer league kicked this weekend with the champions trouncing recently promoted eintracht frankfurt 3-1 .
the dominating play bayern showed makes it a safe bet that the bavarian giants will win record-breaking 19th bundesliga championship this season .
however , those two teams aside , there are 16 other clubs in the league and , as the season starts its 40th year , there are plenty of strong sides gunning for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let go , ottmar ... give someone else a turn .
most experts in the german game , including 14 of the 18 coaches who were surveyed on this season ’ s outcome , say the championship trophy is likely to stay firmly in the hands of bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn and his teammates .
although bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld refrained from investing heavily in new players , an established squad including german player of the year michael ballack , last season ’ s joint top scorer giovanni elber of brazil and sebastian deisler , the most coveted young player in the league , should remain strong enough to snatch the honors yet again .
a rival for the cup ?
their nearest rivals could once more be borussia dortmund .
unseated as champions last april when bayern opened up a title-winning 16-point gap , dortmund will be keen to at least keep in touch with their fierce rivals this time .
but the loss of goalkeeper jens lehmann to arsenal london and long-term injuries to germany ’ s international defender thorsten frings and brazilian evanilson could leave bvb lacking depth in the long run .
on saturday , dortmund had to fight back from a two goal deficit to draw with ruhr valley rival schalke 04 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's michael preetz , left , will hope berlin improve on 5th .
both schalke and hertha berlin could also make a run for the championship if dortmund lags this season .
schalke ’ s new coach jupp heynckes knows a thing or two about glory .
a european cup winning coach with spanish giants real madrid back in 1998 , heynckes will no doubt have a few tricks up his sleeve .
but with a similar line up to last time and an aging defense , schalke looks like a team destined to underachieve again .
berlin has never finished lower than sixth place in the bundesliga and with new faces on board to strengthen a weak offense , it ’ s likely they will be seated thereabouts again this season . hertha , however , suffered a humiliating start to the season , losing 3-0 at home to werder bremen . first in fashion last season ’ s surprise package vfb stuttgart finished an amazing second and grabbed themselves a champions league spot .
however , with mounting debts and rising expectation , the club may find it hard to emulate their best season in years .
they will at least be challenging for the title in one of the more fashionable shirts in the bundesliga , if the league allows the sleeveless puma design an airing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen need to recover quickly from last season 's shocker .
third tier challenges may come in the form of werder bremen and bayer leverkusen .
three time german champions bremen have been a consistent top six side over the last two seasons and will be hoping to improve on that while ailing leverkusen will hope to put the shock of their relegation escape behind them to improve on may ’ s 15th place finish .
coach claus augenthaler knows his players suffered but , on paper at least , leverkusen has one of the strongest squads in the league .
augenthaler will be hoping for a quick recovery to mount a serious challenge .
for their opening match , leverkusen managed a strong 4-1 win against the promoted sc freiburg .
up and down the tables the mid-table line-up is likely to remain the same although finishing positions will be hard to predict .
the likes of kaiserslautern , hanover 96 , vfl wolfsburg , hamburg sv , 1860 munich , borussia moechengladbach and vfl bochum may continue to unspectacularly fill up the table .
bochum however , nicknamed the elevators because of their relegation / promotion tendencies , may be entertaining one of the lower spots reserved for clubs going down the line-up after losing their sensational striker thomas christiansen to hanover .
money status bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas cichon takes his scoring exploits for cologne into the big league .
the top league offers much to the newly promoted and smaller sides , but time spent away from the money of the bundesliga can immediately put such a club at a disadvantage .
funds for new players may be a lot lower than the other more wealthy or established competitors and this can manifest itself as a season long struggle to keep top league status .
sc freiburg , fc köln , hansa rostock and eintracht frankfurt are expected to be engaged in their own fight throughout this season – a fight to stay away from the final three places that signal second division soccer in 2004/05 .
international attention will mostly be focused on the other end of the league .
despite the on-going wrangle over television rights , the new bundesliga season will be aired as usual on both cable and terrestrial tv from friday night .
matches will once again be covered live on radio stations throughout germany .

the german bundesliga started this weekened with current champions bayern munich easily dominating newly promoted eintracht frankfurt .
some pundits are already predicting another bayern title this season . it ’ s a foolish person who says the championship is over before it has begun , but it would be a brave one who puts money on any club other than bayern munich for this season ’ s bundesliga title .
the german top flight soccer league kicked this weekend with the champions trouncing recently promoted eintracht frankfurt 3-1 .
the dominating play bayern showed makes it a safe bet that the bavarian giants will win record-breaking 19th bundesliga championship this season .
however , those two teams aside , there are 16 other clubs in the league and , as the season starts its 40th year , there are plenty of strong sides gunning for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let go , ottmar ... give someone else a turn .
most experts in the german game , including 14 of the 18 coaches who were surveyed on this season ’ s outcome , say the championship trophy is likely to stay firmly in the hands of bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn and his teammates .
although bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld refrained from investing heavily in new players , an established squad including german player of the year michael ballack , last season ’ s joint top scorer giovanni elber of brazil and sebastian deisler , the most coveted young player in the league , should remain strong enough to snatch the honors yet again .
a rival for the cup ?
their nearest rivals could once more be borussia dortmund .
unseated as champions last april when bayern opened up a title-winning 16-point gap , dortmund will be keen to at least keep in touch with their fierce rivals this time .
but the loss of goalkeeper jens lehmann to arsenal london and long-term injuries to germany ’ s international defender thorsten frings and brazilian evanilson could leave bvb lacking depth in the long run .
on saturday , dortmund had to fight back from a two goal deficit to draw with ruhr valley rival schalke 04 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's michael preetz , left , will hope berlin improve on 5th .
both schalke and hertha berlin could also make a run for the championship if dortmund lags this season .
schalke ’ s new coach jupp heynckes knows a thing or two about glory .
a european cup winning coach with spanish giants real madrid back in 1998 , heynckes will no doubt have a few tricks up his sleeve .
but with a similar line up to last time and an aging defense , schalke looks like a team destined to underachieve again .
berlin has never finished lower than sixth place in the bundesliga and with new faces on board to strengthen a weak offense , it ’ s likely they will be seated thereabouts again this season . hertha , however , suffered a humiliating start to the season , losing 3-0 at home to werder bremen . first in fashion last season ’ s surprise package vfb stuttgart finished an amazing second and grabbed themselves a champions league spot .
however , with mounting debts and rising expectation , the club may find it hard to emulate their best season in years .
they will at least be challenging for the title in one of the more fashionable shirts in the bundesliga , if the league allows the sleeveless puma design an airing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen need to recover quickly from last season 's shocker .
third tier challenges may come in the form of werder bremen and bayer leverkusen .
three time german champions bremen have been a consistent top six side over the last two seasons and will be hoping to improve on that while ailing leverkusen will hope to put the shock of their relegation escape behind them to improve on may ’ s 15th place finish .
coach claus augenthaler knows his players suffered but , on paper at least , leverkusen has one of the strongest squads in the league .
augenthaler will be hoping for a quick recovery to mount a serious challenge .
for their opening match , leverkusen managed a strong 4-1 win against the promoted sc freiburg .
up and down the tables the mid-table line-up is likely to remain the same although finishing positions will be hard to predict .
the likes of kaiserslautern , hanover 96 , vfl wolfsburg , hamburg sv , 1860 munich , borussia moechengladbach and vfl bochum may continue to unspectacularly fill up the table .
bochum however , nicknamed the elevators because of their relegation / promotion tendencies , may be entertaining one of the lower spots reserved for clubs going down the line-up after losing their sensational striker thomas christiansen to hanover .
money status bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas cichon takes his scoring exploits for cologne into the big league .
the top league offers much to the newly promoted and smaller sides , but time spent away from the money of the bundesliga can immediately put such a club at a disadvantage .
funds for new players may be a lot lower than the other more wealthy or established competitors and this can manifest itself as a season long struggle to keep top league status .
sc freiburg , fc köln , hansa rostock and eintracht frankfurt are expected to be engaged in their own fight throughout this season – a fight to stay away from the final three places that signal second division soccer in 2004/05 .
international attention will mostly be focused on the other end of the league .
despite the on-going wrangle over television rights , the new bundesliga season will be aired as usual on both cable and terrestrial tv from friday night .
matches will once again be covered live on radio stations throughout germany .
bundesliga fans in china will also be privileged to exclusive coverage through deutsche welle ’ s chinese online portal which will be streaming matches and commentary from the first to the last kick of the ball .

that ’ s because unlike in the united states and many european countries , german smokers still have free reign in many public spaces . whereas smokers in new york or california face an absolute ban on smoking in bars , restaurants and elsewhere , ending smoking in offices or designating non-smoking areas in restaurants is a fairly new phenomenon to germany , a country where roughly a third of the population puffs away daily . but germany ’ s reputation as a cigarette-friendly nation could soon change if a new anti-smoking drive takes off .
marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , on sunday reportedly said she wanted to soon take the first steps to better protect non-smokers . “ not smoking in public has to become what ’ s considered normal , ” she told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview .
“ it has to become the standard that restaurants have non-smoking areas . ” any new anti-smoking initiative would come on the heels of the government ’ s recent decision to hike the price of a pack of cigarettes by a euro over the next couple of years to help pay for health care costs .
taken together , many german smokers could be forgiven for thinking the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens were planning a coming anti-smoking crusade in germany . vending machines on the corner but any truly draconian non-smoking measures like those in the united states are likely a long way off in germany , a country which ostensibly requires people to be 16 to buy tobacco , yet has freely available cigarette vending machines outdoors on nearly every corner of any major city . still , capers-merk call to further restrict smoking – including making hospitals , schools and government buildings completely smoke free – was positively received by some politicians from the conservative opposition .

the german bundesliga started this weekened with current champions bayern munich easily dominating newly promoted eintracht frankfurt .
some pundits are already predicting another bayern title this season . it ’ s a foolish person who says the championship is over before it has begun , but it would be a brave one who puts money on any club other than bayern munich for this season ’ s bundesliga title .
the german top flight soccer league kicked this weekend with the champions trouncing recently promoted eintracht frankfurt 3-1 .
the dominating play bayern showed makes it a safe bet that the bavarian giants will win record-breaking 19th bundesliga championship this season .
however , those two teams aside , there are 16 other clubs in the league and , as the season starts its 40th year , there are plenty of strong sides gunning for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let go , ottmar ... give someone else a turn .
most experts in the german game , including 14 of the 18 coaches who were surveyed on this season ’ s outcome , say the championship trophy is likely to stay firmly in the hands of bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn and his teammates .
although bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld refrained from investing heavily in new players , an established squad including german player of the year michael ballack , last season ’ s joint top scorer giovanni elber of brazil and sebastian deisler , the most coveted young player in the league , should remain strong enough to snatch the honors yet again .
a rival for the cup ?
their nearest rivals could once more be borussia dortmund .
unseated as champions last april when bayern opened up a title-winning 16-point gap , dortmund will be keen to at least keep in touch with their fierce rivals this time .
but the loss of goalkeeper jens lehmann to arsenal london and long-term injuries to germany ’ s international defender thorsten frings and brazilian evanilson could leave bvb lacking depth in the long run .
on saturday , dortmund had to fight back from a two goal deficit to draw with ruhr valley rival schalke 04 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's michael preetz , left , will hope berlin improve on 5th .
both schalke and hertha berlin could also make a run for the championship if dortmund lags this season .
schalke ’ s new coach jupp heynckes knows a thing or two about glory .
a european cup winning coach with spanish giants real madrid back in 1998 , heynckes will no doubt have a few tricks up his sleeve .
but with a similar line up to last time and an aging defense , schalke looks like a team destined to underachieve again .
berlin has never finished lower than sixth place in the bundesliga and with new faces on board to strengthen a weak offense , it ’ s likely they will be seated thereabouts again this season . hertha , however , suffered a humiliating start to the season , losing 3-0 at home to werder bremen . first in fashion last season ’ s surprise package vfb stuttgart finished an amazing second and grabbed themselves a champions league spot .
however , with mounting debts and rising expectation , the club may find it hard to emulate their best season in years .
they will at least be challenging for the title in one of the more fashionable shirts in the bundesliga , if the league allows the sleeveless puma design an airing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen need to recover quickly from last season 's shocker .
third tier challenges may come in the form of werder bremen and bayer leverkusen .
three time german champions bremen have been a consistent top six side over the last two seasons and will be hoping to improve on that while ailing leverkusen will hope to put the shock of their relegation escape behind them to improve on may ’ s 15th place finish .
coach claus augenthaler knows his players suffered but , on paper at least , leverkusen has one of the strongest squads in the league .
augenthaler will be hoping for a quick recovery to mount a serious challenge .
for their opening match , leverkusen managed a strong 4-1 win against the promoted sc freiburg .
up and down the tables the mid-table line-up is likely to remain the same although finishing positions will be hard to predict .
the likes of kaiserslautern , hanover 96 , vfl wolfsburg , hamburg sv , 1860 munich , borussia moechengladbach and vfl bochum may continue to unspectacularly fill up the table .
bochum however , nicknamed the elevators because of their relegation / promotion tendencies , may be entertaining one of the lower spots reserved for clubs going down the line-up after losing their sensational striker thomas christiansen to hanover .
money status bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas cichon takes his scoring exploits for cologne into the big league .
the top league offers much to the newly promoted and smaller sides , but time spent away from the money of the bundesliga can immediately put such a club at a disadvantage .
funds for new players may be a lot lower than the other more wealthy or established competitors and this can manifest itself as a season long struggle to keep top league status .
sc freiburg , fc köln , hansa rostock and eintracht frankfurt are expected to be engaged in their own fight throughout this season – a fight to stay away from the final three places that signal second division soccer in 2004/05 .
international attention will mostly be focused on the other end of the league .
despite the on-going wrangle over television rights , the new bundesliga season will be aired as usual on both cable and terrestrial tv from friday night .
matches will once again be covered live on radio stations throughout germany .
bundesliga fans in china will also be privileged to exclusive coverage through deutsche welle ’ s chinese online portal which will be streaming matches and commentary from the first to the last kick of the ball .

the german bundesliga started this weekened with current champions bayern munich easily dominating newly promoted eintracht frankfurt .
some pundits are already predicting another bayern title this season . it ’ s a foolish person who says the championship is over before it has begun , but it would be a brave one who puts money on any club other than bayern munich for this season ’ s bundesliga title .
the german top flight soccer league kicked this weekend with the champions trouncing recently promoted eintracht frankfurt 3-1 .
the dominating play bayern showed makes it a safe bet that the bavarian giants will win record-breaking 19th bundesliga championship this season .
however , those two teams aside , there are 16 other clubs in the league and , as the season starts its 40th year , there are plenty of strong sides gunning for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let go , ottmar ... give someone else a turn .
most experts in the german game , including 14 of the 18 coaches who were surveyed on this season ’ s outcome , say the championship trophy is likely to stay firmly in the hands of bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn and his teammates .
although bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld refrained from investing heavily in new players , an established squad including german player of the year michael ballack , last season ’ s joint top scorer giovanni elber of brazil and sebastian deisler , the most coveted young player in the league , should remain strong enough to snatch the honors yet again .
a rival for the cup ?
their nearest rivals could once more be borussia dortmund .
unseated as champions last april when bayern opened up a title-winning 16-point gap , dortmund will be keen to at least keep in touch with their fierce rivals this time .
but the loss of goalkeeper jens lehmann to arsenal london and long-term injuries to germany ’ s international defender thorsten frings and brazilian evanilson could leave bvb lacking depth in the long run .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's michael preetz , left , will hope berlin improve on 5th .

the german bundesliga started this weekened with current champions bayern munich easily dominating newly promoted eintracht frankfurt .
some pundits are already predicting another bayern title this season . it ’ s a foolish person who says the championship is over before it has begun , but it would be a brave one who puts money on any club other than bayern munich for this season ’ s bundesliga title .
the german top flight soccer league kicked this weekend with the champions trouncing recently promoted eintracht frankfurt 3-1 .
the dominating play bayern showed makes it a safe bet that the bavarian giants will win record-breaking 19th bundesliga championship this season .
however , those two teams aside , there are 16 other clubs in the league and , as the season starts its 40th year , there are plenty of strong sides gunning for the title .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let go , ottmar ... give someone else a turn .
most experts in the german game , including 14 of the 18 coaches who were surveyed on this season ’ s outcome , say the championship trophy is likely to stay firmly in the hands of bayern goalkeeper oliver kahn and his teammates .
although bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld refrained from investing heavily in new players , an established squad including german player of the year michael ballack , last season ’ s joint top scorer giovanni elber of brazil and sebastian deisler , the most coveted young player in the league , should remain strong enough to snatch the honors yet again .
a rival for the cup ?
their nearest rivals could once more be borussia dortmund .
unseated as champions last april when bayern opened up a title-winning 16-point gap , dortmund will be keen to at least keep in touch with their fierce rivals this time .
but the loss of goalkeeper jens lehmann to arsenal london and long-term injuries to germany ’ s international defender thorsten frings and brazilian evanilson could leave bvb lacking depth in the long run .
on saturday , dortmund had to fight back from a two goal deficit to draw with ruhr valley rival schalke 04 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's michael preetz , left , will hope berlin improve on 5th .
both schalke and hertha berlin could also make a run for the championship if dortmund lags this season .
schalke ’ s new coach jupp heynckes knows a thing or two about glory .
a european cup winning coach with spanish giants real madrid back in 1998 , heynckes will no doubt have a few tricks up his sleeve .
but with a similar line up to last time and an aging defense , schalke looks like a team destined to underachieve again .
berlin has never finished lower than sixth place in the bundesliga and with new faces on board to strengthen a weak offense , it ’ s likely they will be seated thereabouts again this season . hertha , however , suffered a humiliating start to the season , losing 3-0 at home to werder bremen . first in fashion last season ’ s surprise package vfb stuttgart finished an amazing second and grabbed themselves a champions league spot .
however , with mounting debts and rising expectation , the club may find it hard to emulate their best season in years .
they will at least be challenging for the title in one of the more fashionable shirts in the bundesliga , if the league allows the sleeveless puma design an airing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen need to recover quickly from last season 's shocker .
third tier challenges may come in the form of werder bremen and bayer leverkusen .
three time german champions bremen have been a consistent top six side over the last two seasons and will be hoping to improve on that while ailing leverkusen will hope to put the shock of their relegation escape behind them to improve on may ’ s 15th place finish .
coach claus augenthaler knows his players suffered but , on paper at least , leverkusen has one of the strongest squads in the league .
augenthaler will be hoping for a quick recovery to mount a serious challenge .
for their opening match , leverkusen managed a strong 4-1 win against the promoted sc freiburg .
up and down the tables the mid-table line-up is likely to remain the same although finishing positions will be hard to predict .
the likes of kaiserslautern , hanover 96 , vfl wolfsburg , hamburg sv , 1860 munich , borussia moechengladbach and vfl bochum may continue to unspectacularly fill up the table .
bochum however , nicknamed the elevators because of their relegation / promotion tendencies , may be entertaining one of the lower spots reserved for clubs going down the line-up after losing their sensational striker thomas christiansen to hanover .
money status bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas cichon takes his scoring exploits for cologne into the big league .
the top league offers much to the newly promoted and smaller sides , but time spent away from the money of the bundesliga can immediately put such a club at a disadvantage .
funds for new players may be a lot lower than the other more wealthy or established competitors and this can manifest itself as a season long struggle to keep top league status .
sc freiburg , fc köln , hansa rostock and eintracht frankfurt are expected to be engaged in their own fight throughout this season – a fight to stay away from the final three places that signal second division soccer in 2004/05 .
international attention will mostly be focused on the other end of the league .
despite the on-going wrangle over television rights , the new bundesliga season will be aired as usual on both cable and terrestrial tv from friday night .
matches will once again be covered live on radio stations throughout germany .
bundesliga fans in china will also be privileged to exclusive coverage through deutsche welle ’ s chinese online portal which will be streaming matches and commentary from the first to the last kick of the ball .
so , wherever you may be , whoever you support , whatever medium you use to follow it – there ’ s no escaping the fact .

germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke . depending upon what side of the cigarette you ’ re on , germany can either be a nicotine nirvana , or a smoke-filled purgatory .
that ’ s because unlike in the united states and many european countries , german smokers still have free reign in many public spaces . whereas smokers in new york or california face an absolute ban on smoking in bars , restaurants and elsewhere , ending smoking in offices or designating non-smoking areas in restaurants is a fairly new phenomenon to germany , a country where roughly a third of the population puffs away daily . but germany ’ s reputation as a cigarette-friendly nation could soon change if a new anti-smoking drive takes off .
marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , on sunday reportedly said she wanted to soon take the first steps to better protect non-smokers . “ not smoking in public has to become what ’ s considered normal , ” she told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview .
“ it has to become the standard that restaurants have non-smoking areas . ” any new anti-smoking initiative would come on the heels of the government ’ s recent decision to hike the price of a pack of cigarettes by a euro over the next couple of years to help pay for health care costs .
taken together , many german smokers could be forgiven for thinking the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens were planning a coming anti-smoking crusade in germany . vending machines on the corner but any truly draconian non-smoking measures like those in the united states are likely a long way off in germany , a country which ostensibly requires people to be 16 to buy tobacco , yet has freely available cigarette vending machines outdoors on nearly every corner of any major city . still , capers-merk call to further restrict smoking – including making hospitals , schools and government buildings completely smoke free – was positively received by some politicians from the conservative opposition .
bavarian health minister eberhard sinner told the paper smoking was a “ war against good health , especially that of our children . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke ' em now if you got ' em .
“ my goal is society a free from smoke as possible .
that ’ s what i ’ d like to convince people .

germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke . depending upon what side of the cigarette you ’ re on , germany can either be a nicotine nirvana , or a smoke-filled purgatory .
that ’ s because unlike in the united states and many european countries , german smokers still have free reign in many public spaces . whereas smokers in new york or california face an absolute ban on smoking in bars , restaurants and elsewhere , ending smoking in offices or designating non-smoking areas in restaurants is a fairly new phenomenon to germany , a country where roughly a third of the population puffs away daily . but germany ’ s reputation as a cigarette-friendly nation could soon change if a new anti-smoking drive takes off .
marion caspers-merk , deputy health minister in charge of the german government ’ s drug policy , on sunday reportedly said she wanted to soon take the first steps to better protect non-smokers . “ not smoking in public has to become what ’ s considered normal , ” she told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview .
“ it has to become the standard that restaurants have non-smoking areas . ” any new anti-smoking initiative would come on the heels of the government ’ s recent decision to hike the price of a pack of cigarettes by a euro over the next couple of years to help pay for health care costs .
taken together , many german smokers could be forgiven for thinking the ruling center-left coalition of social democrats and greens were planning a coming anti-smoking crusade in germany . vending machines on the corner but any truly draconian non-smoking measures like those in the united states are likely a long way off in germany , a country which ostensibly requires people to be 16 to buy tobacco , yet has freely available cigarette vending machines outdoors on nearly every corner of any major city . still , capers-merk call to further restrict smoking – including making hospitals , schools and government buildings completely smoke free – was positively received by some politicians from the conservative opposition .

a range of digital music players are springing up that let you listen to songs on a hard drive on a hi-fi .
the slimp3 can be programmed via a remote control one of these is a gadget called slimp3 , which spans the divide between your computer and the stereo in the living room .
california-based start-up slim devices came up with the idea to tap into a generation who grew up with the internet and the now defunct file-sharing pioneer napster .
" they now have a disposable income and they do n't think about cds any more , " said patrick cosson , vice-president of sales and marketing .
" they like to listen to individual songs and have masses of playlists .
the slimp3 fits in with a shift of behaviour . "
the gadget went on sale about a year ago .
now , slim devices says thousands of people are using the player every day .
small and unobtrusive unlike many mp3 players , the slimp3 does not have a hard drive .
instead , it works by streaming tracks stored on a computer 's hard drive to a hi-fi .
we really appeal to the mp3 collector , to people in countries where the whole culture has evolved patrick cosson , slim devices at one end , the player is connected to the pc by a network cable and at the other to the hi-fi using standard audio cables .
the player is designed to be discreet and easy to set up .
in most cases , it will recognise the necessary settings and automatically set itself up .
but an internet firewall could prevent the computer from seeing the slimp3 .
slim devices believes its product will appeal to people in their 20s and early 30s who are used to downloading music over the internet , but do not want to have to listen to the songs on tinny pc speakers .
" we really appeal to the mp3 collector , to people in countries where the whole culture has evolved , " said mr cosson .
" once you have content , you want ubiquitous access to it . "
listening to music is straightforward enough .
using a remote control , you can navigate , search and organise all the mp3 music files on a computer .
you can also set up playlists and change the settings on the computer , as well as add internet radio stations to listen to .
slim devices boasts on its site that the player enjoys " high spouse approval " and anecdotal evidence suggests this is the sort of gadget that a partner would welcome , rather than resent .
open code the key element , though , is not the player itself , but the software loaded on a computer that turns it into a music server .
the player has a small display screen " it is really hard to do well , " explained mr cosson , saying that the big challenge was coming up with a system that streamed music to the player without any delays or hiccups .
the software used on the player itself is open source , meaning that other programmers can work on the computer code and improve on it .
slim devices is also encouraging developers to come up with other uses for the player .
already you can download a program that will stream the bbc news ticker on the slimp3 .
in the future , says mr cosson , e-mails or news alerts could be sent to the player to flash up on its screen .
he is reluctant to talk about sales figures , but says the 10-person company set up in 2000 is profitable .
so far , most of the players have been sold in the us , but about a third of sales are to the uk .

california-based start-up slim devices came up with the idea to tap into a generation who grew up with the internet and the now defunct file-sharing pioneer napster .
" they now have a disposable income and they do n't think about cds any more , " said patrick cosson , vice-president of sales and marketing .
" they like to listen to individual songs and have masses of playlists .
the slimp3 fits in with a shift of behaviour . "
the gadget went on sale about a year ago .
now , slim devices says thousands of people are using the player every day .
small and unobtrusive unlike many mp3 players , the slimp3 does not have a hard drive .
instead , it works by streaming tracks stored on a computer 's hard drive to a hi-fi .
we really appeal to the mp3 collector , to people in countries where the whole culture has evolved patrick cosson , slim devices at one end , the player is connected to the pc by a network cable and at the other to the hi-fi using standard audio cables .
the player is designed to be discreet and easy to set up .
in most cases , it will recognise the necessary settings and automatically set itself up .
but an internet firewall could prevent the computer from seeing the slimp3 .
slim devices believes its product will appeal to people in their 20s and early 30s who are used to downloading music over the internet , but do not want to have to listen to the songs on tinny pc speakers .
" we really appeal to the mp3 collector , to people in countries where the whole culture has evolved , " said mr cosson .
" once you have content , you want ubiquitous access to it . "
listening to music is straightforward enough .
using a remote control , you can navigate , search and organise all the mp3 music files on a computer .
you can also set up playlists and change the settings on the computer , as well as add internet radio stations to listen to .
slim devices boasts on its site that the player enjoys " high spouse approval " and anecdotal evidence suggests this is the sort of gadget that a partner would welcome , rather than resent .
open code the key element , though , is not the player itself , but the software loaded on a computer that turns it into a music server .
the player has a small display screen " it is really hard to do well , " explained mr cosson , saying that the big challenge was coming up with a system that streamed music to the player without any delays or hiccups .
the software used on the player itself is open source , meaning that other programmers can work on the computer code and improve on it .
slim devices is also encouraging developers to come up with other uses for the player .
already you can download a program that will stream the bbc news ticker on the slimp3 .
in the future , says mr cosson , e-mails or news alerts could be sent to the player to flash up on its screen .
he is reluctant to talk about sales figures , but says the 10-person company set up in 2000 is profitable .
so far , most of the players have been sold in the us , but about a third of sales are to the uk .

slim devices boasts on its site that the player enjoys " high spouse approval " and anecdotal evidence suggests this is the sort of gadget that a partner would welcome , rather than resent .
open code the key element , though , is not the player itself , but the software loaded on a computer that turns it into a music server .
the player has a small display screen " it is really hard to do well , " explained mr cosson , saying that the big challenge was coming up with a system that streamed music to the player without any delays or hiccups .
the software used on the player itself is open source , meaning that other programmers can work on the computer code and improve on it .
slim devices is also encouraging developers to come up with other uses for the player .
already you can download a program that will stream the bbc news ticker on the slimp3 .
in the future , says mr cosson , e-mails or news alerts could be sent to the player to flash up on its screen .
he is reluctant to talk about sales figures , but says the 10-person company set up in 2000 is profitable .
so far , most of the players have been sold in the us , but about a third of sales are to the uk .

friends of the earth campaigner anthony bown had battled to stop the project to re-route traffic around barnstaple .
he claimed it would disturb large numbers of seabirds on the taw and torridge estuary , along with the habitat of endangered otters .
but his last-ditch appeal was dismissed by three appeal court judges , and devon county council leader brian greenslade said it was " tremendous news " .
" the appeal court judges are to be congratulated on the swift and sensible judgement they have made , " mr greenslade said .
this is a powerful message that the western bypass is a sound scheme , both environmentally and in economic terms brian greenslade , devon county council leader mr bown 's only hope now is to seek leave to appeal to the house of lords .
plans for the barnstaple western bypass include a 2.7 km stretch of new road and a 409 metre long five-span bridge across the river taw , to be known as the downstream bridge .
mr greenslade , who represents barnstaple north , predicted the news would be greeted with delight by thousands of people in north devon .
but he was critical of the objectors who " have cost the community time and money " .
relieve congestion he said the court ruling was " a powerful message that the western bypass is a sound scheme , both environmentally and in economic terms " .
the bypass scheme should ease traffic congestion in barnstaple , taking thousands of vehicles out of the town centre .
an economic impact study revealed that , during the first five years after the building of the bypass , the area would see an additional £ 248m in business turnover and the creation of 1,280 jobs .
the survey showed 74 % of local firms believed the scheme would benefit their business , while public consultation showed 92 % of local people were in favour of the scheme .
councillor greenslade said he believed the court ruling cleared the way for the county council to push on with starting work on the bypass next spring , with the completion expected in the autumn of 2006 .

the company said it had signed a new 1.2 billion euro -lrb- £ 837m -rrb- banking facility which will run from the end of january next year until 30 june 2006 .
the company , which has been forced to axe thousands of jobs amid a sharp downturn in world steel demand , said the money would help finance its working capital requirements .
corus added that its performance had improved during the first half of the year , helped by a slight increase in average steel prices in the european union .
it said the increase had helped put it on track to cut its first-half losses to about £ 41m , down from £ 141m during the same period last year .
corus was more cautious in its forecasts for the second half of the year , saying market conditions in europe remained " challenging and uncertain . "
but it said it expected a boost from a recovery in the value of the euro against the pound .
in the city , corus shares were up 1.5p at 26.5p in early trade .
