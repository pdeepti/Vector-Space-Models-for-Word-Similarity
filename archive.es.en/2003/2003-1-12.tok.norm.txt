beyond the " disco king " image , often crudely portrayed by the media , of white teeth , falsetto voices and nylon jump-suits , the story of the bee gees is one of extraordinary and long-lasting popularity .
with world-wide record sales exceeding 110 million , they are in the top five of the most successful recording artists of all time , together with the beatles , elvis , michael jackson and sir paul mccartney .
bee gees songs have been covered by everyone from elvis through otis redding , diana ross and dionne warwick to newer acts like steps and destiny 's child .
manx roots barry gibb was born in the isle of man in september 1946 , twin brothers robin and maurice three years later .
younger brother andy , who enjoyed his own transatlantic disco hits with i just want to be your everything , -lrb- love is -rrb- thicker than water , and shadow dancing , battled with drugs before dying , aged 30 , in march 1988 .
precocious performers - the name bee gees comes from ' brothers gibb ' - they first appeared before an audience at a manchester cinema in 1955 , three years before the family emigrated to australia .
barry gibb soon established as child stars in their adoptive country , the trio 's many appearances on radio and television brought them popularity and a australian number one with 1966 's spick and speck .
the following year the brothers returned to the united kingdom where they were signed up by the pop impresario robert stigwood .
the first four bee gees albums - bee gees first , horizontal , idea and odessa - contained a host of hit singles , including 1941 new york mining disaster , massachusetts -lrb- the first of their five uk number one hits -rrb- and words .
" blue-eyed soul " their beatles-inspired harmonies and lyrical , if muted , musical style developed , in the 1970s , into what was to become known as " blue-eyed soul . "
a rocky period , during which they split , reformed and had an album , aptly-titled a kick in the pants is worth eight in the head , rejected by their record company , ended with the release of mr natural in 1974 .
during the following three years a series of slickly-produced hits including jive talking , nights on broadway and you should be dancing redeemed the group 's reputation .
stayin ' alive appeared on the saturday night fever soundtrack when stigwood decided to produce saturday night fever , a film adaptation of journalist nik cohn 's article on the disco subculture , it was obvious that the bee gees should help provide the soundtrack .
night fever became an international phenomenon , bringing its star , john travolta , a first taste of superstardom .
music from the film provided the best-selling soundtrack album ever and saw the bee gees , who were never really strictly a disco group , rack up a series of huge hits : stayin ' alive , if i ca n't have you , night fever , tragedy and how deep is your love ?
the 1980s saw the brothers move from performing to writing and producing , working with barbra streisand on her biggest hit , the grammy-winning guilty , with diana ross on chain reaction and with dolly parton and kenny rogers on the country hit islands in the stream .
back on top proving themselves once more the master of the pop idiom , the bee gees returned to the top of the charts in 1987 with the anthemic you win again .
resuming touring after a hiatus of ten years , the group filled concert halls around the world .
their musical style is tantalisingly simple and accessible : upbeat melodies complement what might now be called old-fashioned lyrics and are topped off by the group 's trademark harmonies .
steps are among those to have covered the bee gees it is highly-crafted , maybe slightly anodyne but , even so , still supremely popular .
but something about the bee gees has the effortless ability to get under some people 's skin .
the comedian angus deayton formed part of the spoof group , the hebegeebees , which enjoyed a minor hit with meaningless songs in very high voices .
and in 1997 they stormed off a chat-show when its host , the acerbic clive anderson , revealed that they had once toyed with the idea of being called les tossers before quipping , " you 'll always be tossers to me . "
often covered but the stage musical revival of saturday night fever , combined with the success of cover versions , such as steps ' take on tragedy , have kept the bee gees very much in the public eye , though they dismissed robbie williams ' version of i started a joke as " the kind of thing you 'd hear in a lunatic asylum . "
agents and producers anxious to promote often limited acts see the bee gees as nothing less than high priests of pop .
if barry , robin and maurice ca n't pave your way to the stars , then nothing can .
with hits across five decades , it seems that , either love ' em or hate ' em , they have secured themselves a unique position in pop history .
