with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future . steel- and glass- framed skyscrapers and other staples of postmodernist design have become the signature of post-unification berlin .
among the best examples are the towers rising over potsdamer platz , i.m. pei ’ s extension to the german historical museum and rem koolhaas ’ stark new dutch embassy .
some even play to the city 's lost architecture , but none have sought to recreate the past - at least not until now .
fans of classical architecture scored two major victories in the capital last week .
the first was the city ’ s decision that it will destroy the former east german capital building , the palace of the republic , and eventually replace it with a reconstruction of hohenzollern palace , a spectacular edifice that once dominated the city ’ s center .
the second coup is the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters in a reconstruction of the city ’ s old kommandantur building .
goodbye lenin , hello green space fewer stories in post-unification berlin have been as complicated as that of the former palace of the republic .
along with the debate over the construction of a holocaust memorial , it ’ s been one of the city ’ s two never-ending stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik but this week that chapter came one step closer to completion as the cultural affairs committee of the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , moved to raise the building , which has sat vacant for 13 years as contractors removed toxic asbestos from the building and it awaited a ruling on its final fate .
the building , an east german prestige object beloved and feared by the communist country ’ s citizens – is also the place where freely elected parliamentarians in the east german volkskammer , the then-parliament , concluded a majority vote in summer 1990 adopting the rules of the west german constitution and clearing the way for reunification .
though there are plans to reconstruct the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace , they are currently on ice until the city can turn around its own financial problems or find outside investors willing to put up hundreds of millions .
instead , the government wants tear down the palace of the republic as soon as possible and use it as a green space until the € 650 million bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's former city palace hohenzollern project is financially feasible .
on thursday , the committee said that plans for the hohenzollern palace facade should be " prepared as much as possible " so that construction could commence as soon as the money is there .
but that could take some time .
the government has made little secret of the fact it will first focus its resources on continuing to refurbish the run-down museum island , a unesco world heritage site .
whatever happens with the palace of the republic , it will no doubt be controversial .
some would like to keep it , in some form , as a memorial to the both the good and bad aspects of east german communism .
critics of the building , who are fond of recalling the fact that it was the seat of eric honecker 's totalitarian regime , want to see it subjected to the same fate as the berlin wall , permanently removing a painful part of the city ’ s history .
bertelmann ’ s blast from the past as the debate over the palace continued to simmer , fans of classic architecture had reason to celebrate on thursday , just across the road .
german celebrities from chancellor gerhard schröder to tennis champ boris becker turned out on unter den linden for the magnificant rebirth of the kommandantur building , which was badly damaged from world war ii bombing raids and raised by the east germans in 1950 .
it has now been reincarnated by the media conglomerate bertelsmann to be used as its berlin headquarters .
architect thomas van den valentyn has reconstructed the building ’ s historic shell while creating a thoroughly modern interior of glass and precious materials .
bertelsmann completed the project in two years , with a shoestring budget of € 22.1 million .
as part of the deal to take control of the land that occupied the former kommandatur , the city-state ordered the company to recreate the building ’ s historic facades in any construction it planned .
the building has special historical significance in the city because the last person to command the building was paul von hase , one of the men executed in a failed plot to assassinate hitler .
recreating the former facade presented countless challenges for valentyn and his team of architects , since all original plans for the building had been lost .
all they knew was that it was originally erected in 1653 and then remodelled in 1873 .
persistent researchers later found a negative of a 1910 photo of the building and used it as the basis for drafting new blueprints .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kommandantur as seen from the front .
the inability to recreate a precise and historically accurate kommandantur , however , has drawn mixed reactions in a city where war-time and cold war scars are still abundant .
" a handsome dishonesty , " wrote the architectural critic of the berliner zeit ung newspaper .
" it ’ s okay , really , " wrote die welt .
the public and tourists , however , seem to be adjusting quickly to the bertelsmann building , a report in der spiegel suggested .

with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future . steel- and glass- framed skyscrapers and other staples of postmodernist design have become the signature of post-unification berlin .
among the best examples are the towers rising over potsdamer platz , i.m. pei ’ s extension to the german historical museum and rem koolhaas ’ stark new dutch embassy .
some even play to the city 's lost architecture , but none have sought to recreate the past - at least not until now .
fans of classical architecture scored two major victories in the capital last week .
the first was the city ’ s decision that it will destroy the former east german capital building , the palace of the republic , and eventually replace it with a reconstruction of hohenzollern palace , a spectacular edifice that once dominated the city ’ s center .
the second coup is the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters in a reconstruction of the city ’ s old kommandantur building .
goodbye lenin , hello green space fewer stories in post-unification berlin have been as complicated as that of the former palace of the republic .
along with the debate over the construction of a holocaust memorial , it ’ s been one of the city ’ s two never-ending stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik but this week that chapter came one step closer to completion as the cultural affairs committee of the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , moved to raise the building , which has sat vacant for 13 years as contractors removed toxic asbestos from the building and it awaited a ruling on its final fate .
the building , an east german prestige object beloved and feared by the communist country ’ s citizens – is also the place where freely elected parliamentarians in the east german volkskammer , the then-parliament , concluded a majority vote in summer 1990 adopting the rules of the west german constitution and clearing the way for reunification .
though there are plans to reconstruct the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace , they are currently on ice until the city can turn around its own financial problems or find outside investors willing to put up hundreds of millions .
instead , the government wants tear down the palace of the republic as soon as possible and use it as a green space until the € 650 million bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's former city palace hohenzollern project is financially feasible .
on thursday , the committee said that plans for the hohenzollern palace facade should be " prepared as much as possible " so that construction could commence as soon as the money is there .
but that could take some time .
the government has made little secret of the fact it will first focus its resources on continuing to refurbish the run-down museum island , a unesco world heritage site .
whatever happens with the palace of the republic , it will no doubt be controversial .
some would like to keep it , in some form , as a memorial to the both the good and bad aspects of east german communism .
critics of the building , who are fond of recalling the fact that it was the seat of eric honecker 's totalitarian regime , want to see it subjected to the same fate as the berlin wall , permanently removing a painful part of the city ’ s history .
bertelmann ’ s blast from the past as the debate over the palace continued to simmer , fans of classic architecture had reason to celebrate on thursday , just across the road .
german celebrities from chancellor gerhard schröder to tennis champ boris becker turned out on unter den linden for the magnificant rebirth of the kommandantur building , which was badly damaged from world war ii bombing raids and raised by the east germans in 1950 .
it has now been reincarnated by the media conglomerate bertelsmann to be used as its berlin headquarters .
architect thomas van den valentyn has reconstructed the building ’ s historic shell while creating a thoroughly modern interior of glass and precious materials .
bertelsmann completed the project in two years , with a shoestring budget of € 22.1 million .
as part of the deal to take control of the land that occupied the former kommandatur , the city-state ordered the company to recreate the building ’ s historic facades in any construction it planned .
the building has special historical significance in the city because the last person to command the building was paul von hase , one of the men executed in a failed plot to assassinate hitler .
recreating the former facade presented countless challenges for valentyn and his team of architects , since all original plans for the building had been lost .
all they knew was that it was originally erected in 1653 and then remodelled in 1873 .
persistent researchers later found a negative of a 1910 photo of the building and used it as the basis for drafting new blueprints .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kommandantur as seen from the front .
the inability to recreate a precise and historically accurate kommandantur , however , has drawn mixed reactions in a city where war-time and cold war scars are still abundant .
" a handsome dishonesty , " wrote the architectural critic of the berliner zeit ung newspaper .
" it ’ s okay , really , " wrote die welt .
the public and tourists , however , seem to be adjusting quickly to the bertelsmann building , a report in der spiegel suggested .

with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future . steel- and glass- framed skyscrapers and other staples of postmodernist design have become the signature of post-unification berlin .
among the best examples are the towers rising over potsdamer platz , i.m. pei ’ s extension to the german historical museum and rem koolhaas ’ stark new dutch embassy .
some even play to the city 's lost architecture , but none have sought to recreate the past - at least not until now .
fans of classical architecture scored two major victories in the capital last week .
the first was the city ’ s decision that it will destroy the former east german capital building , the palace of the republic , and eventually replace it with a reconstruction of hohenzollern palace , a spectacular edifice that once dominated the city ’ s center .
the second coup is the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters in a reconstruction of the city ’ s old kommandantur building .
goodbye lenin , hello green space fewer stories in post-unification berlin have been as complicated as that of the former palace of the republic .
along with the debate over the construction of a holocaust memorial , it ’ s been one of the city ’ s two never-ending stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik but this week that chapter came one step closer to completion as the cultural affairs committee of the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , moved to raise the building , which has sat vacant for 13 years as contractors removed toxic asbestos from the building and it awaited a ruling on its final fate .
the building , an east german prestige object beloved and feared by the communist country ’ s citizens – is also the place where freely elected parliamentarians in the east german volkskammer , the then-parliament , concluded a majority vote in summer 1990 adopting the rules of the west german constitution and clearing the way for reunification .
though there are plans to reconstruct the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace , they are currently on ice until the city can turn around its own financial problems or find outside investors willing to put up hundreds of millions .
instead , the government wants tear down the palace of the republic as soon as possible and use it as a green space until the € 650 million bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's former city palace hohenzollern project is financially feasible .
on thursday , the committee said that plans for the hohenzollern palace facade should be " prepared as much as possible " so that construction could commence as soon as the money is there .
but that could take some time .
the government has made little secret of the fact it will first focus its resources on continuing to refurbish the run-down museum island , a unesco world heritage site .
whatever happens with the palace of the republic , it will no doubt be controversial .
some would like to keep it , in some form , as a memorial to the both the good and bad aspects of east german communism .
critics of the building , who are fond of recalling the fact that it was the seat of eric honecker 's totalitarian regime , want to see it subjected to the same fate as the berlin wall , permanently removing a painful part of the city ’ s history .
bertelmann ’ s blast from the past as the debate over the palace continued to simmer , fans of classic architecture had reason to celebrate on thursday , just across the road .
german celebrities from chancellor gerhard schröder to tennis champ boris becker turned out on unter den linden for the magnificant rebirth of the kommandantur building , which was badly damaged from world war ii bombing raids and raised by the east germans in 1950 .
it has now been reincarnated by the media conglomerate bertelsmann to be used as its berlin headquarters .
architect thomas van den valentyn has reconstructed the building ’ s historic shell while creating a thoroughly modern interior of glass and precious materials .
bertelsmann completed the project in two years , with a shoestring budget of € 22.1 million .
as part of the deal to take control of the land that occupied the former kommandatur , the city-state ordered the company to recreate the building ’ s historic facades in any construction it planned .
the building has special historical significance in the city because the last person to command the building was paul von hase , one of the men executed in a failed plot to assassinate hitler .
recreating the former facade presented countless challenges for valentyn and his team of architects , since all original plans for the building had been lost .
all they knew was that it was originally erected in 1653 and then remodelled in 1873 .
persistent researchers later found a negative of a 1910 photo of the building and used it as the basis for drafting new blueprints .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kommandantur as seen from the front .
the inability to recreate a precise and historically accurate kommandantur , however , has drawn mixed reactions in a city where war-time and cold war scars are still abundant .
" a handsome dishonesty , " wrote the architectural critic of the berliner zeit ung newspaper .
" it ’ s okay , really , " wrote die welt .
the public and tourists , however , seem to be adjusting quickly to the bertelsmann building , a report in der spiegel suggested .

with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future . steel- and glass- framed skyscrapers and other staples of postmodernist design have become the signature of post-unification berlin .
among the best examples are the towers rising over potsdamer platz , i.m. pei ’ s extension to the german historical museum and rem koolhaas ’ stark new dutch embassy .
some even play to the city 's lost architecture , but none have sought to recreate the past - at least not until now .
fans of classical architecture scored two major victories in the capital last week .
the first was the city ’ s decision that it will destroy the former east german capital building , the palace of the republic , and eventually replace it with a reconstruction of hohenzollern palace , a spectacular edifice that once dominated the city ’ s center .
the second coup is the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters in a reconstruction of the city ’ s old kommandantur building .
goodbye lenin , hello green space fewer stories in post-unification berlin have been as complicated as that of the former palace of the republic .

the building , an east german prestige object beloved and feared by the communist country ’ s citizens – is also the place where freely elected parliamentarians in the east german volkskammer , the then-parliament , concluded a majority vote in summer 1990 adopting the rules of the west german constitution and clearing the way for reunification .
though there are plans to reconstruct the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace , they are currently on ice until the city can turn around its own financial problems or find outside investors willing to put up hundreds of millions .

on thursday , the committee said that plans for the hohenzollern palace facade should be " prepared as much as possible " so that construction could commence as soon as the money is there .
but that could take some time .
the government has made little secret of the fact it will first focus its resources on continuing to refurbish the run-down museum island , a unesco world heritage site .
whatever happens with the palace of the republic , it will no doubt be controversial .
some would like to keep it , in some form , as a memorial to the both the good and bad aspects of east german communism .
critics of the building , who are fond of recalling the fact that it was the seat of eric honecker 's totalitarian regime , want to see it subjected to the same fate as the berlin wall , permanently removing a painful part of the city ’ s history .
bertelmann ’ s blast from the past as the debate over the palace continued to simmer , fans of classic architecture had reason to celebrate on thursday , just across the road .
german celebrities from chancellor gerhard schröder to tennis champ boris becker turned out on unter den linden for the magnificant rebirth of the kommandantur building , which was badly damaged from world war ii bombing raids and raised by the east germans in 1950 .
it has now been reincarnated by the media conglomerate bertelsmann to be used as its berlin headquarters .
architect thomas van den valentyn has reconstructed the building ’ s historic shell while creating a thoroughly modern interior of glass and precious materials .
bertelsmann completed the project in two years , with a shoestring budget of € 22.1 million .
as part of the deal to take control of the land that occupied the former kommandatur , the city-state ordered the company to recreate the building ’ s historic facades in any construction it planned .
the building has special historical significance in the city because the last person to command the building was paul von hase , one of the men executed in a failed plot to assassinate hitler .
recreating the former facade presented countless challenges for valentyn and his team of architects , since all original plans for the building had been lost .
all they knew was that it was originally erected in 1653 and then remodelled in 1873 .
persistent researchers later found a negative of a 1910 photo of the building and used it as the basis for drafting new blueprints .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kommandantur as seen from the front .
the inability to recreate a precise and historically accurate kommandantur , however , has drawn mixed reactions in a city where war-time and cold war scars are still abundant .

the public and tourists , however , seem to be adjusting quickly to the bertelsmann building , a report in der spiegel suggested .

with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future . steel- and glass- framed skyscrapers and other staples of postmodernist design have become the signature of post-unification berlin .
among the best examples are the towers rising over potsdamer platz , i.m. pei ’ s extension to the german historical museum and rem koolhaas ’ stark new dutch embassy .
some even play to the city 's lost architecture , but none have sought to recreate the past - at least not until now .
fans of classical architecture scored two major victories in the capital last week .
the first was the city ’ s decision that it will destroy the former east german capital building , the palace of the republic , and eventually replace it with a reconstruction of hohenzollern palace , a spectacular edifice that once dominated the city ’ s center .
the second coup is the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters in a reconstruction of the city ’ s old kommandantur building .
goodbye lenin , hello green space fewer stories in post-unification berlin have been as complicated as that of the former palace of the republic .
along with the debate over the construction of a holocaust memorial , it ’ s been one of the city ’ s two never-ending stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik but this week that chapter came one step closer to completion as the cultural affairs committee of the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , moved to raise the building , which has sat vacant for 13 years as contractors removed toxic asbestos from the building and it awaited a ruling on its final fate .
the building , an east german prestige object beloved and feared by the communist country ’ s citizens – is also the place where freely elected parliamentarians in the east german volkskammer , the then-parliament , concluded a majority vote in summer 1990 adopting the rules of the west german constitution and clearing the way for reunification .
though there are plans to reconstruct the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace , they are currently on ice until the city can turn around its own financial problems or find outside investors willing to put up hundreds of millions .
instead , the government wants tear down the palace of the republic as soon as possible and use it as a green space until the € 650 million bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's former city palace hohenzollern project is financially feasible .
on thursday , the committee said that plans for the hohenzollern palace facade should be " prepared as much as possible " so that construction could commence as soon as the money is there .
but that could take some time .
the government has made little secret of the fact it will first focus its resources on continuing to refurbish the run-down museum island , a unesco world heritage site .
whatever happens with the palace of the republic , it will no doubt be controversial .
some would like to keep it , in some form , as a memorial to the both the good and bad aspects of east german communism .
critics of the building , who are fond of recalling the fact that it was the seat of eric honecker 's totalitarian regime , want to see it subjected to the same fate as the berlin wall , permanently removing a painful part of the city ’ s history .
bertelmann ’ s blast from the past as the debate over the palace continued to simmer , fans of classic architecture had reason to celebrate on thursday , just across the road .
german celebrities from chancellor gerhard schröder to tennis champ boris becker turned out on unter den linden for the magnificant rebirth of the kommandantur building , which was badly damaged from world war ii bombing raids and raised by the east germans in 1950 .
it has now been reincarnated by the media conglomerate bertelsmann to be used as its berlin headquarters .
architect thomas van den valentyn has reconstructed the building ’ s historic shell while creating a thoroughly modern interior of glass and precious materials .
bertelsmann completed the project in two years , with a shoestring budget of € 22.1 million .
as part of the deal to take control of the land that occupied the former kommandatur , the city-state ordered the company to recreate the building ’ s historic facades in any construction it planned .
the building has special historical significance in the city because the last person to command the building was paul von hase , one of the men executed in a failed plot to assassinate hitler .
recreating the former facade presented countless challenges for valentyn and his team of architects , since all original plans for the building had been lost .
all they knew was that it was originally erected in 1653 and then remodelled in 1873 .
persistent researchers later found a negative of a 1910 photo of the building and used it as the basis for drafting new blueprints .

whatever happens with the palace of the republic , it will no doubt be controversial .

german celebrities from chancellor gerhard schröder to tennis champ boris becker turned out on unter den linden for the magnificant rebirth of the kommandantur building , which was badly damaged from world war ii bombing raids and raised by the east germans in 1950 .
it has now been reincarnated by the media conglomerate bertelsmann to be used as its berlin headquarters .
architect thomas van den valentyn has reconstructed the building ’ s historic shell while creating a thoroughly modern interior of glass and precious materials .
bertelsmann completed the project in two years , with a shoestring budget of € 22.1 million .
as part of the deal to take control of the land that occupied the former kommandatur , the city-state ordered the company to recreate the building ’ s historic facades in any construction it planned .
the building has special historical significance in the city because the last person to command the building was paul von hase , one of the men executed in a failed plot to assassinate hitler .
recreating the former facade presented countless challenges for valentyn and his team of architects , since all original plans for the building had been lost .
all they knew was that it was originally erected in 1653 and then remodelled in 1873 .
persistent researchers later found a negative of a 1910 photo of the building and used it as the basis for drafting new blueprints .

the building , an east german prestige object beloved and feared by the communist country ’ s citizens – is also the place where freely elected parliamentarians in the east german volkskammer , the then-parliament , concluded a majority vote in summer 1990 adopting the rules of the west german constitution and clearing the way for reunification .

on thursday , the committee said that plans for the hohenzollern palace facade should be " prepared as much as possible " so that construction could commence as soon as the money is there .
but that could take some time .
the government has made little secret of the fact it will first focus its resources on continuing to refurbish the run-down museum island , a unesco world heritage site .
whatever happens with the palace of the republic , it will no doubt be controversial .
some would like to keep it , in some form , as a memorial to the both the good and bad aspects of east german communism .

german celebrities from chancellor gerhard schröder to tennis champ boris becker turned out on unter den linden for the magnificant rebirth of the kommandantur building , which was badly damaged from world war ii bombing raids and raised by the east germans in 1950 .
it has now been reincarnated by the media conglomerate bertelsmann to be used as its berlin headquarters .
architect thomas van den valentyn has reconstructed the building ’ s historic shell while creating a thoroughly modern interior of glass and precious materials .
bertelsmann completed the project in two years , with a shoestring budget of € 22.1 million .
as part of the deal to take control of the land that occupied the former kommandatur , the city-state ordered the company to recreate the building ’ s historic facades in any construction it planned .
the building has special historical significance in the city because the last person to command the building was paul von hase , one of the men executed in a failed plot to assassinate hitler .
recreating the former facade presented countless challenges for valentyn and his team of architects , since all original plans for the building had been lost .
all they knew was that it was originally erected in 1653 and then remodelled in 1873 .
persistent researchers later found a negative of a 1910 photo of the building and used it as the basis for drafting new blueprints .

home to germany ’ s second-largest jewish community , bavaria ’ s capital begins construction of a synagogue and cultural center that organizers hope will help the city ’ s reestablished jewish population flourish and grow . german president johannes rau on sunday called on germans to join together to fight for freedom and tolerance in the wake of a recent spate of anti-semitic incidents in the country .
rau traveled to munich to lay the foundation stone for a new jewish community center in the bavarian city .
the presence of police and sharpshooters , however , focused attention on less fortunate developments in recent weeks .
two months ago , police foiled plans by right-wing extremists to bomb sunday 's event .
since then , 14 extremists have been arrested total – a fact not lost on the german president .
" whoever attacks minorities is planting a bomb in the foundation of our society , " rau said while laying the stone at the future synagogue and community center .
rau said he had been " distraught " by the idea that " right-wing extremists set on murder " had again planned an attack on a jewish center on the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
the extremists arrested in the incident are part of a group organized by 27-year-old neo nazi martin wiese .
prosecutors say they will seek to charge the group ’ s followers with membership in a terrorist organization , following the discovery of 14 kilograms of explosives , including 1.7 kilograms of highly explosive tnt , they believe were intended for use in the planned attack .
" we have to show that intimidation and violence don ’ t set the climate in our country , " rau told the more than 600 people gathered at the event .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber also attended , warning that " anti-semitism can never again be allowed to become socially acceptable in germany or anywhere else on the continent . "
stoiber added that all legal tools at the state ’ s disposal must be used to fight what he called the " criminal lunacy " of right-wing extremists .
" we won ’ t accept that jewish life has to be hidden out of fear of attacks , " he warned .
meanwhile , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , called for increased vigilance in combating germany ’ s anti-semites and warned against the " minimization of right-wing extremist " crimes .
remembrance and reconciliation taking place on the anniversary of one of the nazi ’ s worst crimes against the jews – which led to the destruction of synagogues , the murder of hundreds and the plundering of jewish businesses – sunday ’ s event served as both a remembrance of the horrid event as well as a symbol of reconciliation .
" this isn ’ t just a day of unclouded joy , " said charlotte knobloch , chairwoman of the munich ’ s jewish community organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch -lrb- right -rrb- still , there was much to celebrate on sunday .
with the € 57 million project , community leaders are seeking to restore jewish life " where it used to be , in the city center . "
in addition to the new synagogue , a museum and cultural and community facilities will also be constructed by 2007 .
a kosher restaurant , jewish school and daycare center are also planned .
despite the revelations in september of a possible attack against the facility , the local jewish community has decided not to install high-security barricades , as cities like berlin have assembled at jewish facilities .
instead , organizers want a " meeting place of the cultures . "
to ensure the safety of visitors , center officials say they will work closely with police and install security cameras .
" there won ’ t be any walls or barbed wire , " munich culture community vice president jehoshua chmiel told the public broadcaster bayerische rundfunk .
9,000 and growing for the local jewish community , germany ’ s second largest after berlin , the center can ’ t come soon enough .
the 9,000-strong jewish community grew quickly after the fall of the wall , with a major influx of russian jews with german ancestry .
the community 's existing facilities are buckling under the pressure of a growing population and , already , they are having trouble finding enough space to hold language and religion classes that aid the integration of newcomers . more importantly , perhaps , is that many see the construction of the complex as a further sign of the recovery of munich ’ s jewish community .
the city ’ s original synagogue was destroyed by the nazis on june 8 , 1938 .
shortly after , mass deportations of the city ’ s jews began to concentration camps .

home to germany ’ s second-largest jewish community , bavaria ’ s capital begins construction of a synagogue and cultural center that organizers hope will help the city ’ s reestablished jewish population flourish and grow . german president johannes rau on sunday called on germans to join together to fight for freedom and tolerance in the wake of a recent spate of anti-semitic incidents in the country .
rau traveled to munich to lay the foundation stone for a new jewish community center in the bavarian city .
the presence of police and sharpshooters , however , focused attention on less fortunate developments in recent weeks .
two months ago , police foiled plans by right-wing extremists to bomb sunday 's event .
since then , 14 extremists have been arrested total – a fact not lost on the german president .
" whoever attacks minorities is planting a bomb in the foundation of our society , " rau said while laying the stone at the future synagogue and community center .
rau said he had been " distraught " by the idea that " right-wing extremists set on murder " had again planned an attack on a jewish center on the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
the extremists arrested in the incident are part of a group organized by 27-year-old neo nazi martin wiese .
prosecutors say they will seek to charge the group ’ s followers with membership in a terrorist organization , following the discovery of 14 kilograms of explosives , including 1.7 kilograms of highly explosive tnt , they believe were intended for use in the planned attack .
" we have to show that intimidation and violence don ’ t set the climate in our country , " rau told the more than 600 people gathered at the event .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber also attended , warning that " anti-semitism can never again be allowed to become socially acceptable in germany or anywhere else on the continent . "
stoiber added that all legal tools at the state ’ s disposal must be used to fight what he called the " criminal lunacy " of right-wing extremists .
" we won ’ t accept that jewish life has to be hidden out of fear of attacks , " he warned .
meanwhile , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , called for increased vigilance in combating germany ’ s anti-semites and warned against the " minimization of right-wing extremist " crimes .
remembrance and reconciliation taking place on the anniversary of one of the nazi ’ s worst crimes against the jews – which led to the destruction of synagogues , the murder of hundreds and the plundering of jewish businesses – sunday ’ s event served as both a remembrance of the horrid event as well as a symbol of reconciliation .
" this isn ’ t just a day of unclouded joy , " said charlotte knobloch , chairwoman of the munich ’ s jewish community organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch -lrb- right -rrb- still , there was much to celebrate on sunday .
with the € 57 million project , community leaders are seeking to restore jewish life " where it used to be , in the city center . "
in addition to the new synagogue , a museum and cultural and community facilities will also be constructed by 2007 .
a kosher restaurant , jewish school and daycare center are also planned .
despite the revelations in september of a possible attack against the facility , the local jewish community has decided not to install high-security barricades , as cities like berlin have assembled at jewish facilities .
instead , organizers want a " meeting place of the cultures . "
to ensure the safety of visitors , center officials say they will work closely with police and install security cameras .
" there won ’ t be any walls or barbed wire , " munich culture community vice president jehoshua chmiel told the public broadcaster bayerische rundfunk .
9,000 and growing for the local jewish community , germany ’ s second largest after berlin , the center can ’ t come soon enough .
the 9,000-strong jewish community grew quickly after the fall of the wall , with a major influx of russian jews with german ancestry .
the community 's existing facilities are buckling under the pressure of a growing population and , already , they are having trouble finding enough space to hold language and religion classes that aid the integration of newcomers . more importantly , perhaps , is that many see the construction of the complex as a further sign of the recovery of munich ’ s jewish community .
the city ’ s original synagogue was destroyed by the nazis on june 8 , 1938 .
shortly after , mass deportations of the city ’ s jews began to concentration camps .
by april 30 , 1945 , american forces occupying the city were only able to register seven living jews in the city . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chief federal prosecutor will charge neo-nazis a group of neo-nazis , who were arrested in september after allegedly planning an attack on the construction site of a new synagogue in munich , will have to stand trial .

architect thomas van den valentyn has reconstructed the building ’ s historic shell while creating a thoroughly modern interior of glass and precious materials .
bertelsmann completed the project in two years , with a shoestring budget of € 22.1 million .
as part of the deal to take control of the land that occupied the former kommandatur , the city-state ordered the company to recreate the building ’ s historic facades in any construction it planned .
the building has special historical significance in the city because the last person to command the building was paul von hase , one of the men executed in a failed plot to assassinate hitler .
recreating the former facade presented countless challenges for valentyn and his team of architects , since all original plans for the building had been lost .
all they knew was that it was originally erected in 1653 and then remodelled in 1873 .
persistent researchers later found a negative of a 1910 photo of the building and used it as the basis for drafting new blueprints .

home to germany ’ s second-largest jewish community , bavaria ’ s capital begins construction of a synagogue and cultural center that organizers hope will help the city ’ s reestablished jewish population flourish and grow . german president johannes rau on sunday called on germans to join together to fight for freedom and tolerance in the wake of a recent spate of anti-semitic incidents in the country .
rau traveled to munich to lay the foundation stone for a new jewish community center in the bavarian city .
the presence of police and sharpshooters , however , focused attention on less fortunate developments in recent weeks .
two months ago , police foiled plans by right-wing extremists to bomb sunday 's event .
since then , 14 extremists have been arrested total – a fact not lost on the german president .
" whoever attacks minorities is planting a bomb in the foundation of our society , " rau said while laying the stone at the future synagogue and community center .
rau said he had been " distraught " by the idea that " right-wing extremists set on murder " had again planned an attack on a jewish center on the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
the extremists arrested in the incident are part of a group organized by 27-year-old neo nazi martin wiese .
prosecutors say they will seek to charge the group ’ s followers with membership in a terrorist organization , following the discovery of 14 kilograms of explosives , including 1.7 kilograms of highly explosive tnt , they believe were intended for use in the planned attack .
" we have to show that intimidation and violence don ’ t set the climate in our country , " rau told the more than 600 people gathered at the event .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber also attended , warning that " anti-semitism can never again be allowed to become socially acceptable in germany or anywhere else on the continent . "
stoiber added that all legal tools at the state ’ s disposal must be used to fight what he called the " criminal lunacy " of right-wing extremists .
" we won ’ t accept that jewish life has to be hidden out of fear of attacks , " he warned .
meanwhile , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , called for increased vigilance in combating germany ’ s anti-semites and warned against the " minimization of right-wing extremist " crimes .
remembrance and reconciliation taking place on the anniversary of one of the nazi ’ s worst crimes against the jews – which led to the destruction of synagogues , the murder of hundreds and the plundering of jewish businesses – sunday ’ s event served as both a remembrance of the horrid event as well as a symbol of reconciliation .
" this isn ’ t just a day of unclouded joy , " said charlotte knobloch , chairwoman of the munich ’ s jewish community organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch -lrb- right -rrb- still , there was much to celebrate on sunday .
with the € 57 million project , community leaders are seeking to restore jewish life " where it used to be , in the city center . "
in addition to the new synagogue , a museum and cultural and community facilities will also be constructed by 2007 .
a kosher restaurant , jewish school and daycare center are also planned .
despite the revelations in september of a possible attack against the facility , the local jewish community has decided not to install high-security barricades , as cities like berlin have assembled at jewish facilities .
instead , organizers want a " meeting place of the cultures . "
to ensure the safety of visitors , center officials say they will work closely with police and install security cameras .
" there won ’ t be any walls or barbed wire , " munich culture community vice president jehoshua chmiel told the public broadcaster bayerische rundfunk .
9,000 and growing for the local jewish community , germany ’ s second largest after berlin , the center can ’ t come soon enough .
the 9,000-strong jewish community grew quickly after the fall of the wall , with a major influx of russian jews with german ancestry .
the community 's existing facilities are buckling under the pressure of a growing population and , already , they are having trouble finding enough space to hold language and religion classes that aid the integration of newcomers . more importantly , perhaps , is that many see the construction of the complex as a further sign of the recovery of munich ’ s jewish community .
the city ’ s original synagogue was destroyed by the nazis on june 8 , 1938 .
shortly after , mass deportations of the city ’ s jews began to concentration camps .
by april 30 , 1945 , american forces occupying the city were only able to register seven living jews in the city . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chief federal prosecutor will charge neo-nazis a group of neo-nazis , who were arrested in september after allegedly planning an attack on the construction site of a new synagogue in munich , will have to stand trial .

home to germany ’ s second-largest jewish community , bavaria ’ s capital begins construction of a synagogue and cultural center that organizers hope will help the city ’ s reestablished jewish population flourish and grow . german president johannes rau on sunday called on germans to join together to fight for freedom and tolerance in the wake of a recent spate of anti-semitic incidents in the country .
rau traveled to munich to lay the foundation stone for a new jewish community center in the bavarian city .
the presence of police and sharpshooters , however , focused attention on less fortunate developments in recent weeks .
two months ago , police foiled plans by right-wing extremists to bomb sunday 's event .
since then , 14 extremists have been arrested total – a fact not lost on the german president .
" whoever attacks minorities is planting a bomb in the foundation of our society , " rau said while laying the stone at the future synagogue and community center .
rau said he had been " distraught " by the idea that " right-wing extremists set on murder " had again planned an attack on a jewish center on the 65th anniversary of the kristallnacht nazi pogroms .
the extremists arrested in the incident are part of a group organized by 27-year-old neo nazi martin wiese .
prosecutors say they will seek to charge the group ’ s followers with membership in a terrorist organization , following the discovery of 14 kilograms of explosives , including 1.7 kilograms of highly explosive tnt , they believe were intended for use in the planned attack .
" we have to show that intimidation and violence don ’ t set the climate in our country , " rau told the more than 600 people gathered at the event .
bavarian premier edmund stoiber also attended , warning that " anti-semitism can never again be allowed to become socially acceptable in germany or anywhere else on the continent . "
stoiber added that all legal tools at the state ’ s disposal must be used to fight what he called the " criminal lunacy " of right-wing extremists .
" we won ’ t accept that jewish life has to be hidden out of fear of attacks , " he warned .
meanwhile , the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , called for increased vigilance in combating germany ’ s anti-semites and warned against the " minimization of right-wing extremist " crimes .
remembrance and reconciliation taking place on the anniversary of one of the nazi ’ s worst crimes against the jews – which led to the destruction of synagogues , the murder of hundreds and the plundering of jewish businesses – sunday ’ s event served as both a remembrance of the horrid event as well as a symbol of reconciliation .
" this isn ’ t just a day of unclouded joy , " said charlotte knobloch , chairwoman of the munich ’ s jewish community organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch -lrb- right -rrb- still , there was much to celebrate on sunday .
with the € 57 million project , community leaders are seeking to restore jewish life " where it used to be , in the city center . "
in addition to the new synagogue , a museum and cultural and community facilities will also be constructed by 2007 .
a kosher restaurant , jewish school and daycare center are also planned .
despite the revelations in september of a possible attack against the facility , the local jewish community has decided not to install high-security barricades , as cities like berlin have assembled at jewish facilities .
instead , organizers want a " meeting place of the cultures . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.11.2003 a victory for the old in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertelmann 's new berlin headquarters .
with the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters and plans to reconstruct hohenzollern palace , someday , germany 's capital is looking back to the future . steel- and glass- framed skyscrapers and other staples of postmodernist design have become the signature of post-unification berlin .
among the best examples are the towers rising over potsdamer platz , i.m. pei ’ s extension to the german historical museum and rem koolhaas ’ stark new dutch embassy .
some even play to the city 's lost architecture , but none have sought to recreate the past - at least not until now .
fans of classical architecture scored two major victories in the capital last week .
the first was the city ’ s decision that it will destroy the former east german capital building , the palace of the republic , and eventually replace it with a reconstruction of hohenzollern palace , a spectacular edifice that once dominated the city ’ s center .
the second coup is the opening of bertelsmann ’ s new berlin headquarters in a reconstruction of the city ’ s old kommandantur building .
goodbye lenin , hello green space fewer stories in post-unification berlin have been as complicated as that of the former palace of the republic .
along with the debate over the construction of a holocaust memorial , it ’ s been one of the city ’ s two never-ending stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palast der republik but this week that chapter came one step closer to completion as the cultural affairs committee of the bundestag , germany ’ s parliament , moved to raise the building , which has sat vacant for 13 years as contractors removed toxic asbestos from the building and it awaited a ruling on its final fate .
the building , an east german prestige object beloved and feared by the communist country ’ s citizens – is also the place where freely elected parliamentarians in the east german volkskammer , the then-parliament , concluded a majority vote in summer 1990 adopting the rules of the west german constitution and clearing the way for reunification .
though there are plans to reconstruct the 19th century baroque hohenzollern palace , they are currently on ice until the city can turn around its own financial problems or find outside investors willing to put up hundreds of millions .
instead , the government wants tear down the palace of the republic as soon as possible and use it as a green space until the € 650 million bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's former city palace hohenzollern project is financially feasible .
on thursday , the committee said that plans for the hohenzollern palace facade should be " prepared as much as possible " so that construction could commence as soon as the money is there .
but that could take some time .
the government has made little secret of the fact it will first focus its resources on continuing to refurbish the run-down museum island , a unesco world heritage site .
whatever happens with the palace of the republic , it will no doubt be controversial .
some would like to keep it , in some form , as a memorial to the both the good and bad aspects of east german communism .
critics of the building , who are fond of recalling the fact that it was the seat of eric honecker 's totalitarian regime , want to see it subjected to the same fate as the berlin wall , permanently removing a painful part of the city ’ s history .
bertelmann ’ s blast from the past as the debate over the palace continued to simmer , fans of classic architecture had reason to celebrate on thursday , just across the road .
german celebrities from chancellor gerhard schröder to tennis champ boris becker turned out on unter den linden for the magnificant rebirth of the kommandantur building , which was badly damaged from world war ii bombing raids and raised by the east germans in 1950 .
it has now been reincarnated by the media conglomerate bertelsmann to be used as its berlin headquarters .
architect thomas van den valentyn has reconstructed the building ’ s historic shell while creating a thoroughly modern interior of glass and precious materials .
bertelsmann completed the project in two years , with a shoestring budget of € 22.1 million .
as part of the deal to take control of the land that occupied the former kommandatur , the city-state ordered the company to recreate the building ’ s historic facades in any construction it planned .
the building has special historical significance in the city because the last person to command the building was paul von hase , one of the men executed in a failed plot to assassinate hitler .
recreating the former facade presented countless challenges for valentyn and his team of architects , since all original plans for the building had been lost .
all they knew was that it was originally erected in 1653 and then remodelled in 1873 .
persistent researchers later found a negative of a 1910 photo of the building and used it as the basis for drafting new blueprints .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kommandantur as seen from the front .
the inability to recreate a precise and historically accurate kommandantur , however , has drawn mixed reactions in a city where war-time and cold war scars are still abundant .
" a handsome dishonesty , " wrote the architectural critic of the berliner zeit ung newspaper .
" it ’ s okay , really , " wrote die welt .
the public and tourists , however , seem to be adjusting quickly to the bertelsmann building , a report in der spiegel suggested .
in recent weeks , the newsweekly wrote , passersby could be heard saying : " it ’ s good that they ’ ve given that building a fresh coat of paint .

the attack , shortly after midnight -lrb- 2100 gmt -rrb- on saturday , hit the muhaya residential compound in the west of the capital and left many children among the wounded .
saudi officials have said that the attack bore the hallmarks of an al-qaeda suicide bombing .
" this is a crime against innocents which is in the style of al-qaeda , it is an al-qaeda operation , " said a saudi security source quoted by reuters news agency .
the explosion came a day after the united states shut its diplomatic missions in saudi arabia after " credible evidence " of a threat and the uk embassy in bahrain issued a similar warning .
the us warned its embassy staff in the saudi capital to stay at home on sunday , " pending further assessment of the security situation " .
saudi police in mecca recently uncovered a suspected al-qaeda cell believed to be planning attacks .
thirty-five people were killed in a string of suicide attacks in may on a western compound in riyadh .
the saudi ambassador in london , prince turki al-faisal , condemned the attack as " a terrible event carried out by evil people whose sole aim is the destruction of the kingdom " .
screams the muhaya compound contains about 200 houses , mainly home to foreigners from the arab world - including lebanese , egyptians and syrians .
there are no confirmed foreign fatalities , but one american is wounded and another missing , according to a us official .
in pictures : riyadh blast no us diplomatic staff live in the compound , which is several kilometres away from the diplomatic quarter .
the uk foreign office said two britons were unaccounted for .
the compound is near several private residences belonging to the saudi royal family , according to a western diplomat quoted by reuters news agency .
government officials said that gunmen tried to enter the compound , and there was an exchange of fire with security guards .
eyewitnesses said the attackers tried to get through an outer wall , to drive a car bomb as close as possible before detonating it .
eyewitnesses said a crater five metres wide and two metres deep was left by the blast , and rescue workers are trying to locate anyone trapped under rubble .
it is unknown how many people carried out the attacks .
at least 10 houses are reported to have been destroyed .
" we heard very strong explosion and we saw the fire , " bassem al-hourani , who said he was a resident at the targeted compound , told arabic television station al-arabiya .
" i heard screams of the children and women ...
i saw a lot of people injured and i believe there a lot of people dead , " he said .
many of the injured are children who were at home while their parents were out , following the breaking of the ramadan fast for the day .
during ramadan , shopping and public life takes place after sunset and people stay out later in the evenings .
' extremely wary ' the us embassy in riyadh said on friday it had " credible information that terrorists in saudi arabia have moved from the planning to operational phase of planned attacks in the kingdom . "
the statement said : " the embassy strongly urges all american citizens in the kingdom to be especially vigilant when in any area that is perceived to be american or western . "
state department spokesman richard boucher said fears of an imminent attack in the kingdom meant it was " prudent ... to warn americans and to close our operations for a review . "
missions in riyadh , jeddah and dhahran were closed on saturday .
britain , canada and australia last month issued similar alerts , which angered saudi officials , who say they have made important strides in fighting terror inside the country .
on thursday , two suspected members of the al-qaeda cell in mecca blew themselves up apparently to avoid arrest , while a third suspect was shot dead by security forces in riyadh .

king norodom sihanouk brokered an agreement between the three main parties to form a coalition government last week - following july 's inconclusive elections .
he urged legislators to take their seats in the national assembly " without delay " and get on with the business of government .
thousands of people lined the streets of the capital phnom penh to watch the independence celebrations , which coincided with an annual water festival .
the 81-year-old king , with his wife queen monineath , began the day 's festivities by driving to the independence monument to light a candle .
he was later joined by leading politicians , members of the royal family and foreign ambassadors for a civilian parade .
king sihanouk was on the throne when the country won its freedom from the french on 9 november 1953 , after 90 years of colonial rule .
warning although he has no actual power , the king still plays an important role in the country and helped bring about a breakthrough over a new government .
but he warned the politicians , in an independence day speech : " if you can not -lrb- work together -rrb- you have to take responsibility before the people and the nation . "
the king and his wife took part in independence day celebrations prime minister hun sen 's cambodian people 's party fell short of a two-thirds majority needed to form its own government in elections last july .
the other two parties , royalist funcinpec and opposition sam rainsy party , had refused to join a coalition until an agreement in principle last wednesday .
under the deal , funcinpec leader prince norodom ranariddh would become president of the national assembly and a sam rainsy party member would be one of parliament 's three vice-presidents .
however , some reports suggest opposition leaders still have concerns about the agreement - and want assurances that the political system will be reformed .
correspondents say that the king 's survival apart , much has changed in cambodia since its move to independence .
once a dominant power in the region , it is now one of the world 's poorest countries .
it still bears the scars of the khmer rouge regime , which is estimated to have killed more than 1.5 million people between 1975 and 1979 .

talks between the us and brazil over a planned free-trade deal for the americas have been described as " positive and useful " .
the discussions were aimed at settling differences between the two countries ahead of a 34-country summit later this month .
the two have disagreed over farm subsidies and anti-dumping tariffs .
the " free trade agreement of the americas " -lrb- ftaa -rrb- is meant to be signed off by the end of this year .
the meeting in washington included 16 of the 34 countries whom the us wants included in the ftaa .
optimism brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said progress had been made in his meeting with us trade representative robert zoellick .
" i think we now have a good basis for a successful meeting in miami , " he said , referring to the forthcoming 34-country summit .
he added that he and mr zoellick had outlined their vision for the free trade area to the other 14 countries at the meeting .
" of course , the substantive issues are not resolved , but the general approach is one , that maybe with observations that should be included , will enable us to move forward , " he said .
a senior us trade official told reporters the meeting had been " positive and useful " , although settling the differences would remain a tough task .
" it is going to be a challenge , " he said .
" but i feel certainly better about it today than i did two days ago because i think that we got some useful insight in this meeting . "
the us wants the ftaa to include regional rules covering , among other things , government procurement , foreign investment and lower tariffs .
but brazil says these issues should be decided by the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- and wants to focus on farm subsidies instead .
opposition the creation of the ftaa is one of us president george w bush 's key economic goals .
but in the wake of the collapse of world trade talks in the mexican resort of cancun in september , the chances of reaching a deal looked remote .
brazil was one of three leading developing countries - the other two were india and china - who led opposition to the us , japan and europe in cancun .
they demanded that the richer countries move further and faster on agricultural subsidies and tariffs before they were prepared to accept new issues such as investment protection and the trade in services .
brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva renewed calls for fairer trade rules for developing nations this weekend .
speaking in south africa on the last leg of his african tour , he urged " joint action " to promote developing countries ' interests .

metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens said the technology being developed by scientists for scotland yard , " represents a quantum leap in terms of how we tackle this type of crime " .
the scheme was initiated by met commissioner sir john earlier this year as he announced a crack down on gun crime .
figures show that shooting incidents across england and wales rose by 35 % from 17,589 in 2000-2001 to 22,314 last year . "
we will have the proper safeguards in place to make sure it is not misused " sir john stevens speaking on bbc one 's breakfast with frost , sir john said : " we 're trying to make use of all the technology that 's around .
" it 's bringing together the techniques used in anti-terrorism also linking it to technology used to search people at airports . "
he added : " we hope to be using the device by christmas or in the new year . "
asked if it was inspired by the james bond movies , he said : " no , it is a work up of the techniques used in anti-terrorism . "
