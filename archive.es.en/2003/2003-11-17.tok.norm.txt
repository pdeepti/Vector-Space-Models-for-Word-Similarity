not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "
the appreciative audience , nary a dissenting voice among them , responded with whoops and cheers .
this , like the rest of moore 's german tour stops , was going to be an easy crowd .
germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .
his book titles have etched themselves into the newsmagazine der spiegel 's bestseller lists , and " bowling for columbine " drew in half a million fans in the first two months after opening last year .

he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .
the group wants to turn the gigantic building into an amusement park called " tropical island , " complete with rainforests , lagoons and sandy beaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to turn the gigantic cargolifter hall into a tropical amusement park .
on thursday , the investors announced that they have already bought plants and aim for an oct .
2004 opening .
the park is expected to create 500 jobs .
the consortium is shouldering the € 70 million -lrb- $ 82.3 million -rrb- construction costs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2003 ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decade after its inception , the war crimes tribunal is still dealing with the horror of the balkan wars .
the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .

the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .

semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .
according to handelsblatt , amd ceo hector ruiz recently described the existing plant as a " phenomenal success , " adding that " the factory has the highest productivity of any amd factory ever , as well delivering excellent production quality . " still competitive amd 's decision shows that despite high taxation and a costly social system , germany is still a competitive location for investors .
since the early 1990s , nearly 2,000 foreign companies from over 40 countries have invested in eastern germany , of which 300 are from the united states , including dow chemical , motorola , coca-cola and general motors .
other foreign investors include france 's vivendi and totalfinaelf , as well as japan 's sony and fujitsu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd factories in dresden represent a success story that contrasts starkly with the fate of a similar chip factory still under construction in the struggling east german state of brandenburg .
the project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , has failed to hand over funds and the plant is on hold until federal and state officials decide whether or not to act as guarantors . the microelectronics industry may be flourishing in the dresden region , but the problems in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- show that clusters have yet to emerge in eastern germany on a larger scale .
and according to the regional newspaper sächsische zeitung , the good news for dresden now almost certainly spells bad news for frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in terms of state subsidies . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hope dwindling for chip plant in eastern germany a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region -lrb- november 17 , 2003 -rrb- 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .
the group wants to turn the gigantic building into an amusement park called " tropical island , " complete with rainforests , lagoons and sandy beaches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2003 ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decade after its inception , the war crimes tribunal is still dealing with the horror of the balkan wars .
the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .
this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .
the group wants to turn the gigantic building into an amusement park called " tropical island , " complete with rainforests , lagoons and sandy beaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to turn the gigantic cargolifter hall into a tropical amusement park .
on thursday , the investors announced that they have already bought plants and aim for an oct .
2004 opening .
the park is expected to create 500 jobs .
the consortium is shouldering the € 70 million -lrb- $ 82.3 million -rrb- construction costs .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .

semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .
according to handelsblatt , amd ceo hector ruiz recently described the existing plant as a " phenomenal success , " adding that " the factory has the highest productivity of any amd factory ever , as well delivering excellent production quality . " still competitive amd 's decision shows that despite high taxation and a costly social system , germany is still a competitive location for investors .
since the early 1990s , nearly 2,000 foreign companies from over 40 countries have invested in eastern germany , of which 300 are from the united states , including dow chemical , motorola , coca-cola and general motors .
other foreign investors include france 's vivendi and totalfinaelf , as well as japan 's sony and fujitsu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd factories in dresden represent a success story that contrasts starkly with the fate of a similar chip factory still under construction in the struggling east german state of brandenburg .
the project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , has failed to hand over funds and the plant is on hold until federal and state officials decide whether or not to act as guarantors . the microelectronics industry may be flourishing in the dresden region , but the problems in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- show that clusters have yet to emerge in eastern germany on a larger scale .
and according to the regional newspaper sächsische zeitung , the good news for dresden now almost certainly spells bad news for frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in terms of state subsidies . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hope dwindling for chip plant in eastern germany a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .

semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .
according to handelsblatt , amd ceo hector ruiz recently described the existing plant as a " phenomenal success , " adding that " the factory has the highest productivity of any amd factory ever , as well delivering excellent production quality . " still competitive amd 's decision shows that despite high taxation and a costly social system , germany is still a competitive location for investors .
since the early 1990s , nearly 2,000 foreign companies from over 40 countries have invested in eastern germany , of which 300 are from the united states , including dow chemical , motorola , coca-cola and general motors .
other foreign investors include france 's vivendi and totalfinaelf , as well as japan 's sony and fujitsu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd factories in dresden represent a success story that contrasts starkly with the fate of a similar chip factory still under construction in the struggling east german state of brandenburg .
the project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , has failed to hand over funds and the plant is on hold until federal and state officials decide whether or not to act as guarantors . the microelectronics industry may be flourishing in the dresden region , but the problems in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- show that clusters have yet to emerge in eastern germany on a larger scale .
and according to the regional newspaper sächsische zeitung , the good news for dresden now almost certainly spells bad news for frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in terms of state subsidies . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hope dwindling for chip plant in eastern germany a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .
the group wants to turn the gigantic building into an amusement park called " tropical island , " complete with rainforests , lagoons and sandy beaches .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .

this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .
milosevic has denied the legality of the court on many occasions , saying on one appearance : “ i consider this trial to be a false trial and these accusations to be false accusations .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

but its commitment to european values and norms should be recognized in light of the tragedy . " even snakes leave worshipers in peace , " goes an old turkish saying .
seen as such , those responsible for the bombing attacks against faithful jews at two synagogues in istanbul are lower than snakes and have only their outside appearance in common with human beings .
there can be no justification and no understanding for the violent acts that destroyed two jewish religious institutions on the bosporous .
which organizations are behind the attack remains unclear .
but the fact that various groups are competing against each other to claim responsibility only heightens the blasphemy .
what is clear is that extremist groups and fanatics are as capable of igniting infernos in the largely muslim turkey as they are in the rest of the world .
it is impossible to understand what sort of fanaticism drives people to bring pain to others and destroy houses of worship .
the readiness for violence does n't even stop short of aid organizations and civilian peace groups , as was recently seen in iraq .
symbols like the red cross and red crescent on cars , or trucks with the u.n. emblem on the side are no longer a guarantee that they will be left unscathed by bombs , grenades or bullets .
fight against terror failed that turkey has long been the target of international terrorism is no secret .
the country has been trying for 80 years to find a peaceful co-existence between islam and democracy and regards itself as a model for other countries with islamic populations .
as a result , the shock within the islamic justice and development party of prime minister tayyip erdogan , is that much greater : the goal of taking turkey out of the gun sights of terrorism has failed .
more visibly than ever before , the attack on the synagogues shows how big a threat the secular foundation of the turkish republic is actually facing .
the nato nation that shares borders with middle east hotspots needs more than military protection and verbal commitments from the west .
turkey is europe the concrete ties between turkey and europe and the anchoring of european values and standards in turkish society should at the very latest be clear now , in light of the attacks in istanbul .
those who want to claim the values and standards of contemporary civilization exclusively for christianity , go against the christian teaching to love thy neighbor .
those who still want to block turkey 's progress towards europe on religious and cultural grounds , and use their rejection in election campaigns , are behaving irresponsibly .
turkey 's efforts to fulfill european expectations in areas such as human rights , democracy , minority protection rights and economic progress need to be attended to seriously and supported - there can be no alternative . baha güngör heads deutsche welle 's turkish program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says cyprus could be obstacle to turkish bid the european union on wednesday praised recent reforms by turkey .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .
the group wants to turn the gigantic building into an amusement park called " tropical island , " complete with rainforests , lagoons and sandy beaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to turn the gigantic cargolifter hall into a tropical amusement park .
on thursday , the investors announced that they have already bought plants and aim for an oct .
2004 opening .
the park is expected to create 500 jobs .
the consortium is shouldering the € 70 million -lrb- $ 82.3 million -rrb- construction costs .

not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "
the appreciative audience , nary a dissenting voice among them , responded with whoops and cheers .
this , like the rest of moore 's german tour stops , was going to be an easy crowd .
germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .
his book titles have etched themselves into the newsmagazine der spiegel 's bestseller lists , and " bowling for columbine " drew in half a million fans in the first two months after opening last year .
all of which put moore , dressed in jeans , an untucked shirt and brown jacket , in a thankful mood sunday night at the columbia-halle in berlin .
" it has not been the easiest year in america to stand up and voice your dissent , " said moore , leaning his large frame into the podium .
" it makes a lot of difference to have friends overseas supporting me . "
for the next hour , moore riffed , sang and joked his way through the topics that have become standard fare in his books and crowd favorites .
he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "
germany , " do n't be like us " moore even took aim at the reforms chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition are trying to push through .
he warned germany not to " cut away the safety net . "
" do n't be like us , " he said .
" you 've got to stand up , right ?

mixing in sports metaphors , moore said popular european sports like rugby and soccer revealed the old continent 's more cooperative , team-oriented approach to matters .
" in rugby , if someone gets tackled with the ball , he just throws it to the next person , " he said .
" ' no !

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .

the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .
the group wants to turn the gigantic building into an amusement park called " tropical island , " complete with rainforests , lagoons and sandy beaches .

not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "
the appreciative audience , nary a dissenting voice among them , responded with whoops and cheers .
this , like the rest of moore 's german tour stops , was going to be an easy crowd .
germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .
his book titles have etched themselves into the newsmagazine der spiegel 's bestseller lists , and " bowling for columbine " drew in half a million fans in the first two months after opening last year .
all of which put moore , dressed in jeans , an untucked shirt and brown jacket , in a thankful mood sunday night at the columbia-halle in berlin .
" it has not been the easiest year in america to stand up and voice your dissent , " said moore , leaning his large frame into the podium .
" it makes a lot of difference to have friends overseas supporting me . "
for the next hour , moore riffed , sang and joked his way through the topics that have become standard fare in his books and crowd favorites .
he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "
germany , " do n't be like us " moore even took aim at the reforms chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition are trying to push through .
he warned germany not to " cut away the safety net . "
" do n't be like us , " he said .
" you 've got to stand up , right ?
you 've got to be brave . "
mixing in sports metaphors , moore said popular european sports like rugby and soccer revealed the old continent 's more cooperative , team-oriented approach to matters .
" in rugby , if someone gets tackled with the ball , he just throws it to the next person , " he said .
" ' no !
you go on without me ! " ' he sang , slipping into one of many over-the-top imitations that delighted the berlin crowd .
too much showboating ?

-lrb- ap photo / mark j. terrill -rrb- " he 's an entertainer , " said german literature student janina alfen , 22 .
" he writes things that are funny to laugh about and later make you think . "
but moore 's alleged creative handling of the facts in his books and films , a standard criticism in the united states , is beginning to make its way across the atlantic .
german journalists , professors and critics have begun to take off the gloves when talking about the bestseller .
even devoted fans left feeling empty-handed after an appearance they felt was more entertainment than substance .
" i thought it was almost like a kind of cult .
he says somebody is crap and everyone cheers , " said max klemmt , a truck driver .
" i thought he would bring a few more examples and a bit more context . "
but for most , moore 's ranting against bush 's handling of the iraq war and his plan to unseat the incumbent president was enough .
" i think germany is sick of the whole iraq war thing , and they 're starting to see they were right , " said tarek ahmia , 37 , a music technician , after the show , " and finally an american comes along and confirms that .

not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "
the appreciative audience , nary a dissenting voice among them , responded with whoops and cheers .
this , like the rest of moore 's german tour stops , was going to be an easy crowd .
germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .
his book titles have etched themselves into the newsmagazine der spiegel 's bestseller lists , and " bowling for columbine " drew in half a million fans in the first two months after opening last year .
all of which put moore , dressed in jeans , an untucked shirt and brown jacket , in a thankful mood sunday night at the columbia-halle in berlin .
" it has not been the easiest year in america to stand up and voice your dissent , " said moore , leaning his large frame into the podium .
" it makes a lot of difference to have friends overseas supporting me . "
for the next hour , moore riffed , sang and joked his way through the topics that have become standard fare in his books and crowd favorites .
he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "
germany , " do n't be like us " moore even took aim at the reforms chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition are trying to push through .
he warned germany not to " cut away the safety net . "
" do n't be like us , " he said .
" you 've got to stand up , right ?
you 've got to be brave . "
mixing in sports metaphors , moore said popular european sports like rugby and soccer revealed the old continent 's more cooperative , team-oriented approach to matters .
" in rugby , if someone gets tackled with the ball , he just throws it to the next person , " he said .
" ' no !
you go on without me ! " ' he sang , slipping into one of many over-the-top imitations that delighted the berlin crowd .

semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .

" still competitive amd 's decision shows that despite high taxation and a costly social system , germany is still a competitive location for investors .
since the early 1990s , nearly 2,000 foreign companies from over 40 countries have invested in eastern germany , of which 300 are from the united states , including dow chemical , motorola , coca-cola and general motors .
other foreign investors include france 's vivendi and totalfinaelf , as well as japan 's sony and fujitsu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd factories in dresden represent a success story that contrasts starkly with the fate of a similar chip factory still under construction in the struggling east german state of brandenburg .

for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "

germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .

" it makes a lot of difference to have friends overseas supporting me . "
for the next hour , moore riffed , sang and joked his way through the topics that have become standard fare in his books and crowd favorites .
he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .

in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2003 ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decade after its inception , the war crimes tribunal is still dealing with the horror of the balkan wars .
the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .

also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .

after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2003 opinion : attacks prove turkey is part of europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish government 's efforts to avoid the scope of international terrorism failed with the bombing of two synagogues .
but its commitment to european values and norms should be recognized in light of the tragedy . " even snakes leave worshipers in peace , " goes an old turkish saying .
seen as such , those responsible for the bombing attacks against faithful jews at two synagogues in istanbul are lower than snakes and have only their outside appearance in common with human beings .
there can be no justification and no understanding for the violent acts that destroyed two jewish religious institutions on the bosporous .
which organizations are behind the attack remains unclear .
but the fact that various groups are competing against each other to claim responsibility only heightens the blasphemy .
what is clear is that extremist groups and fanatics are as capable of igniting infernos in the largely muslim turkey as they are in the rest of the world .
it is impossible to understand what sort of fanaticism drives people to bring pain to others and destroy houses of worship .
the readiness for violence does n't even stop short of aid organizations and civilian peace groups , as was recently seen in iraq .
symbols like the red cross and red crescent on cars , or trucks with the u.n. emblem on the side are no longer a guarantee that they will be left unscathed by bombs , grenades or bullets .
fight against terror failed that turkey has long been the target of international terrorism is no secret .
the country has been trying for 80 years to find a peaceful co-existence between islam and democracy and regards itself as a model for other countries with islamic populations .
as a result , the shock within the islamic justice and development party of prime minister tayyip erdogan , is that much greater : the goal of taking turkey out of the gun sights of terrorism has failed .
more visibly than ever before , the attack on the synagogues shows how big a threat the secular foundation of the turkish republic is actually facing .
the nato nation that shares borders with middle east hotspots needs more than military protection and verbal commitments from the west .
turkey is europe the concrete ties between turkey and europe and the anchoring of european values and standards in turkish society should at the very latest be clear now , in light of the attacks in istanbul .
those who want to claim the values and standards of contemporary civilization exclusively for christianity , go against the christian teaching to love thy neighbor .
those who still want to block turkey 's progress towards europe on religious and cultural grounds , and use their rejection in election campaigns , are behaving irresponsibly .
turkey 's efforts to fulfill european expectations in areas such as human rights , democracy , minority protection rights and economic progress need to be attended to seriously and supported - there can be no alternative . baha güngör heads deutsche welle 's turkish program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says cyprus could be obstacle to turkish bid the european union on wednesday praised recent reforms by turkey .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .

not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "
the appreciative audience , nary a dissenting voice among them , responded with whoops and cheers .
this , like the rest of moore 's german tour stops , was going to be an easy crowd .
germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .
his book titles have etched themselves into the newsmagazine der spiegel 's bestseller lists , and " bowling for columbine " drew in half a million fans in the first two months after opening last year .
all of which put moore , dressed in jeans , an untucked shirt and brown jacket , in a thankful mood sunday night at the columbia-halle in berlin .
" it has not been the easiest year in america to stand up and voice your dissent , " said moore , leaning his large frame into the podium .
" it makes a lot of difference to have friends overseas supporting me . "
for the next hour , moore riffed , sang and joked his way through the topics that have become standard fare in his books and crowd favorites .
he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "
germany , " do n't be like us " moore even took aim at the reforms chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition are trying to push through .
he warned germany not to " cut away the safety net . "
" do n't be like us , " he said .
" you 've got to stand up , right ?
you 've got to be brave . "
mixing in sports metaphors , moore said popular european sports like rugby and soccer revealed the old continent 's more cooperative , team-oriented approach to matters .
" in rugby , if someone gets tackled with the ball , he just throws it to the next person , " he said .
" ' no !
you go on without me ! " ' he sang , slipping into one of many over-the-top imitations that delighted the berlin crowd .
too much showboating ?

-lrb- ap photo / mark j. terrill -rrb- " he 's an entertainer , " said german literature student janina alfen , 22 .
" he writes things that are funny to laugh about and later make you think . "
but moore 's alleged creative handling of the facts in his books and films , a standard criticism in the united states , is beginning to make its way across the atlantic .
german journalists , professors and critics have begun to take off the gloves when talking about the bestseller .
even devoted fans left feeling empty-handed after an appearance they felt was more entertainment than substance .
" i thought it was almost like a kind of cult .
he says somebody is crap and everyone cheers , " said max klemmt , a truck driver .
" i thought he would bring a few more examples and a bit more context . "
but for most , moore 's ranting against bush 's handling of the iraq war and his plan to unseat the incumbent president was enough .
" i think germany is sick of the whole iraq war thing , and they 're starting to see they were right , " said tarek ahmia , 37 , a music technician , after the show , " and finally an american comes along and confirms that .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .
this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .
milosevic has denied the legality of the court on many occasions , saying on one appearance : “ i consider this trial to be a false trial and these accusations to be false accusations .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .
the group wants to turn the gigantic building into an amusement park called " tropical island , " complete with rainforests , lagoons and sandy beaches .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .

in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .
this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .
milosevic has denied the legality of the court on many occasions , saying on one appearance : “ i consider this trial to be a false trial and these accusations to be false accusations .
they are illegal ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte stands during statements , after meeting with yugoslav justice minister savo markovic , in belgrade , thursday , april 18 , 2002 .
del ponte arrived to belgrade to press anew for the extradition of war crimes suspects , including top fugitives accused of genocide in the bosnian war .
as the tribunal commemorates its ten year anniversary , chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- picture -rrb- continues to clash with the ex-president and his fellow detainees as she pushes for the maximum sentence allowed - life imprisonment .
it is a slow process to hear all the evidence and instigate the trials of the accused ; a process that will undoubtedly continue for many months to come . long , slow process to justice to date , 38 indicted war criminals are currently in the detention unit in the hague .
three of the indicted have been provisionally released .
the judges have so far reached 19 guilty verdicts and ordered two acquittals . as the search continues for suspects and justice , it is quite possible that the united nations tribunal for war crimes will mark its 20th anniversary with alleged serbian war criminals sitting in the cells below it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctant unlocking of serbia 's secret past by the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime , serbian secret police had files on 400,000 of the country 's citizens .

but its commitment to european values and norms should be recognized in light of the tragedy . " even snakes leave worshipers in peace , " goes an old turkish saying .
seen as such , those responsible for the bombing attacks against faithful jews at two synagogues in istanbul are lower than snakes and have only their outside appearance in common with human beings .
there can be no justification and no understanding for the violent acts that destroyed two jewish religious institutions on the bosporous .
which organizations are behind the attack remains unclear .
but the fact that various groups are competing against each other to claim responsibility only heightens the blasphemy .
what is clear is that extremist groups and fanatics are as capable of igniting infernos in the largely muslim turkey as they are in the rest of the world .
it is impossible to understand what sort of fanaticism drives people to bring pain to others and destroy houses of worship .
the readiness for violence does n't even stop short of aid organizations and civilian peace groups , as was recently seen in iraq .
symbols like the red cross and red crescent on cars , or trucks with the u.n. emblem on the side are no longer a guarantee that they will be left unscathed by bombs , grenades or bullets .
fight against terror failed that turkey has long been the target of international terrorism is no secret .
the country has been trying for 80 years to find a peaceful co-existence between islam and democracy and regards itself as a model for other countries with islamic populations .
as a result , the shock within the islamic justice and development party of prime minister tayyip erdogan , is that much greater : the goal of taking turkey out of the gun sights of terrorism has failed .
more visibly than ever before , the attack on the synagogues shows how big a threat the secular foundation of the turkish republic is actually facing .
the nato nation that shares borders with middle east hotspots needs more than military protection and verbal commitments from the west .
turkey is europe the concrete ties between turkey and europe and the anchoring of european values and standards in turkish society should at the very latest be clear now , in light of the attacks in istanbul .
those who want to claim the values and standards of contemporary civilization exclusively for christianity , go against the christian teaching to love thy neighbor .
those who still want to block turkey 's progress towards europe on religious and cultural grounds , and use their rejection in election campaigns , are behaving irresponsibly .
turkey 's efforts to fulfill european expectations in areas such as human rights , democracy , minority protection rights and economic progress need to be attended to seriously and supported - there can be no alternative . baha güngör heads deutsche welle 's turkish program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says cyprus could be obstacle to turkish bid the european union on wednesday praised recent reforms by turkey .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .
according to handelsblatt , amd ceo hector ruiz recently described the existing plant as a " phenomenal success , " adding that " the factory has the highest productivity of any amd factory ever , as well delivering excellent production quality . " still competitive amd 's decision shows that despite high taxation and a costly social system , germany is still a competitive location for investors .
since the early 1990s , nearly 2,000 foreign companies from over 40 countries have invested in eastern germany , of which 300 are from the united states , including dow chemical , motorola , coca-cola and general motors .
other foreign investors include france 's vivendi and totalfinaelf , as well as japan 's sony and fujitsu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd factories in dresden represent a success story that contrasts starkly with the fate of a similar chip factory still under construction in the struggling east german state of brandenburg .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .
the group wants to turn the gigantic building into an amusement park called " tropical island , " complete with rainforests , lagoons and sandy beaches .

not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "
the appreciative audience , nary a dissenting voice among them , responded with whoops and cheers .
this , like the rest of moore 's german tour stops , was going to be an easy crowd .
germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .
his book titles have etched themselves into the newsmagazine der spiegel 's bestseller lists , and " bowling for columbine " drew in half a million fans in the first two months after opening last year .
all of which put moore , dressed in jeans , an untucked shirt and brown jacket , in a thankful mood sunday night at the columbia-halle in berlin .
" it has not been the easiest year in america to stand up and voice your dissent , " said moore , leaning his large frame into the podium .
" it makes a lot of difference to have friends overseas supporting me . "
for the next hour , moore riffed , sang and joked his way through the topics that have become standard fare in his books and crowd favorites .
he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "
germany , " do n't be like us " moore even took aim at the reforms chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition are trying to push through .
he warned germany not to " cut away the safety net . "
" do n't be like us , " he said .
" you 've got to stand up , right ?
you 've got to be brave . "
mixing in sports metaphors , moore said popular european sports like rugby and soccer revealed the old continent 's more cooperative , team-oriented approach to matters .
" in rugby , if someone gets tackled with the ball , he just throws it to the next person , " he said .
" ' no !
you go on without me ! " ' he sang , slipping into one of many over-the-top imitations that delighted the berlin crowd .

but moore 's alleged creative handling of the facts in his books and films , a standard criticism in the united states , is beginning to make its way across the atlantic .
german journalists , professors and critics have begun to take off the gloves when talking about the bestseller .
even devoted fans left feeling empty-handed after an appearance they felt was more entertainment than substance .
" i thought it was almost like a kind of cult .
he says somebody is crap and everyone cheers , " said max klemmt , a truck driver .
" i thought he would bring a few more examples and a bit more context . "
but for most , moore 's ranting against bush 's handling of the iraq war and his plan to unseat the incumbent president was enough .
" i think germany is sick of the whole iraq war thing , and they 're starting to see they were right , " said tarek ahmia , 37 , a music technician , after the show , " and finally an american comes along and confirms that .

" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .
the group wants to turn the gigantic building into an amusement park called " tropical island , " complete with rainforests , lagoons and sandy beaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to turn the gigantic cargolifter hall into a tropical amusement park .
on thursday , the investors announced that they have already bought plants and aim for an oct .
2004 opening .
the park is expected to create 500 jobs .
the consortium is shouldering the € 70 million -lrb- $ 82.3 million -rrb- construction costs .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .

" we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .

the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2003 u.s. investor poised to build semiconductor plant in dresden großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd is already at work in dresden , the former center of computer production for east germany .
semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .
according to handelsblatt , amd ceo hector ruiz recently described the existing plant as a " phenomenal success , " adding that " the factory has the highest productivity of any amd factory ever , as well delivering excellent production quality . " still competitive amd 's decision shows that despite high taxation and a costly social system , germany is still a competitive location for investors .
since the early 1990s , nearly 2,000 foreign companies from over 40 countries have invested in eastern germany , of which 300 are from the united states , including dow chemical , motorola , coca-cola and general motors .
other foreign investors include france 's vivendi and totalfinaelf , as well as japan 's sony and fujitsu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd factories in dresden represent a success story that contrasts starkly with the fate of a similar chip factory still under construction in the struggling east german state of brandenburg .
the project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , has failed to hand over funds and the plant is on hold until federal and state officials decide whether or not to act as guarantors . the microelectronics industry may be flourishing in the dresden region , but the problems in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- show that clusters have yet to emerge in eastern germany on a larger scale .
and according to the regional newspaper sächsische zeitung , the good news for dresden now almost certainly spells bad news for frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in terms of state subsidies . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hope dwindling for chip plant in eastern germany a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .
this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "
the appreciative audience , nary a dissenting voice among them , responded with whoops and cheers .
this , like the rest of moore 's german tour stops , was going to be an easy crowd .
germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .
his book titles have etched themselves into the newsmagazine der spiegel 's bestseller lists , and " bowling for columbine " drew in half a million fans in the first two months after opening last year .
all of which put moore , dressed in jeans , an untucked shirt and brown jacket , in a thankful mood sunday night at the columbia-halle in berlin .
" it has not been the easiest year in america to stand up and voice your dissent , " said moore , leaning his large frame into the podium .
" it makes a lot of difference to have friends overseas supporting me . "
for the next hour , moore riffed , sang and joked his way through the topics that have become standard fare in his books and crowd favorites .
he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "
germany , " do n't be like us " moore even took aim at the reforms chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition are trying to push through .
he warned germany not to " cut away the safety net . "
" do n't be like us , " he said .
" you 've got to stand up , right ?
you 've got to be brave . "
mixing in sports metaphors , moore said popular european sports like rugby and soccer revealed the old continent 's more cooperative , team-oriented approach to matters .
" in rugby , if someone gets tackled with the ball , he just throws it to the next person , " he said .
" ' no !

not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "
the appreciative audience , nary a dissenting voice among them , responded with whoops and cheers .
this , like the rest of moore 's german tour stops , was going to be an easy crowd .
germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .
his book titles have etched themselves into the newsmagazine der spiegel 's bestseller lists , and " bowling for columbine " drew in half a million fans in the first two months after opening last year .
all of which put moore , dressed in jeans , an untucked shirt and brown jacket , in a thankful mood sunday night at the columbia-halle in berlin .
" it has not been the easiest year in america to stand up and voice your dissent , " said moore , leaning his large frame into the podium .
" it makes a lot of difference to have friends overseas supporting me . "
for the next hour , moore riffed , sang and joked his way through the topics that have become standard fare in his books and crowd favorites .
he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "
germany , " do n't be like us " moore even took aim at the reforms chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition are trying to push through .
he warned germany not to " cut away the safety net . "
" do n't be like us , " he said .
" you 've got to stand up , right ?
you 've got to be brave . "
mixing in sports metaphors , moore said popular european sports like rugby and soccer revealed the old continent 's more cooperative , team-oriented approach to matters .
" in rugby , if someone gets tackled with the ball , he just throws it to the next person , " he said .
" ' no !
you go on without me ! " ' he sang , slipping into one of many over-the-top imitations that delighted the berlin crowd .
too much showboating ?

-lrb- ap photo / mark j. terrill -rrb- " he 's an entertainer , " said german literature student janina alfen , 22 .
" he writes things that are funny to laugh about and later make you think . "
but moore 's alleged creative handling of the facts in his books and films , a standard criticism in the united states , is beginning to make its way across the atlantic .
german journalists , professors and critics have begun to take off the gloves when talking about the bestseller .
even devoted fans left feeling empty-handed after an appearance they felt was more entertainment than substance .
" i thought it was almost like a kind of cult .
he says somebody is crap and everyone cheers , " said max klemmt , a truck driver .
" i thought he would bring a few more examples and a bit more context . "
but for most , moore 's ranting against bush 's handling of the iraq war and his plan to unseat the incumbent president was enough .
" i think germany is sick of the whole iraq war thing , and they 're starting to see they were right , " said tarek ahmia , 37 , a music technician , after the show , " and finally an american comes along and confirms that .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .

this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .
the group wants to turn the gigantic building into an amusement park called " tropical island , " complete with rainforests , lagoons and sandy beaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investors want to turn the gigantic cargolifter hall into a tropical amusement park .
on thursday , the investors announced that they have already bought plants and aim for an oct .

but its commitment to european values and norms should be recognized in light of the tragedy . " even snakes leave worshipers in peace , " goes an old turkish saying .
seen as such , those responsible for the bombing attacks against faithful jews at two synagogues in istanbul are lower than snakes and have only their outside appearance in common with human beings .
there can be no justification and no understanding for the violent acts that destroyed two jewish religious institutions on the bosporous .
which organizations are behind the attack remains unclear .
but the fact that various groups are competing against each other to claim responsibility only heightens the blasphemy .
what is clear is that extremist groups and fanatics are as capable of igniting infernos in the largely muslim turkey as they are in the rest of the world .
it is impossible to understand what sort of fanaticism drives people to bring pain to others and destroy houses of worship .
the readiness for violence does n't even stop short of aid organizations and civilian peace groups , as was recently seen in iraq .
symbols like the red cross and red crescent on cars , or trucks with the u.n. emblem on the side are no longer a guarantee that they will be left unscathed by bombs , grenades or bullets .
fight against terror failed that turkey has long been the target of international terrorism is no secret .
the country has been trying for 80 years to find a peaceful co-existence between islam and democracy and regards itself as a model for other countries with islamic populations .
as a result , the shock within the islamic justice and development party of prime minister tayyip erdogan , is that much greater : the goal of taking turkey out of the gun sights of terrorism has failed .
more visibly than ever before , the attack on the synagogues shows how big a threat the secular foundation of the turkish republic is actually facing .
the nato nation that shares borders with middle east hotspots needs more than military protection and verbal commitments from the west .
turkey is europe the concrete ties between turkey and europe and the anchoring of european values and standards in turkish society should at the very latest be clear now , in light of the attacks in istanbul .
those who want to claim the values and standards of contemporary civilization exclusively for christianity , go against the christian teaching to love thy neighbor .
those who still want to block turkey 's progress towards europe on religious and cultural grounds , and use their rejection in election campaigns , are behaving irresponsibly .
turkey 's efforts to fulfill european expectations in areas such as human rights , democracy , minority protection rights and economic progress need to be attended to seriously and supported - there can be no alternative . baha güngör heads deutsche welle 's turkish program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says cyprus could be obstacle to turkish bid the european union on wednesday praised recent reforms by turkey .
but in its annual expansion report , brussels said the country still had to make substantial progress before it could take up negotiations to join the eu .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .
this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .
milosevic has denied the legality of the court on many occasions , saying on one appearance : “ i consider this trial to be a false trial and these accusations to be false accusations .
they are illegal ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte stands during statements , after meeting with yugoslav justice minister savo markovic , in belgrade , thursday , april 18 , 2002 .

it is a slow process to hear all the evidence and instigate the trials of the accused ; a process that will undoubtedly continue for many months to come . long , slow process to justice to date , 38 indicted war criminals are currently in the detention unit in the hague .
three of the indicted have been provisionally released .

after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .
this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .
milosevic has denied the legality of the court on many occasions , saying on one appearance : “ i consider this trial to be a false trial and these accusations to be false accusations .
they are illegal ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte stands during statements , after meeting with yugoslav justice minister savo markovic , in belgrade , thursday , april 18 , 2002 .
del ponte arrived to belgrade to press anew for the extradition of war crimes suspects , including top fugitives accused of genocide in the bosnian war .
as the tribunal commemorates its ten year anniversary , chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- picture -rrb- continues to clash with the ex-president and his fellow detainees as she pushes for the maximum sentence allowed - life imprisonment .
it is a slow process to hear all the evidence and instigate the trials of the accused ; a process that will undoubtedly continue for many months to come . long , slow process to justice to date , 38 indicted war criminals are currently in the detention unit in the hague .
three of the indicted have been provisionally released .
the judges have so far reached 19 guilty verdicts and ordered two acquittals . as the search continues for suspects and justice , it is quite possible that the united nations tribunal for war crimes will mark its 20th anniversary with alleged serbian war criminals sitting in the cells below it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctant unlocking of serbia 's secret past by the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime , serbian secret police had files on 400,000 of the country 's citizens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2003 opinion : attacks prove turkey is part of europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish government 's efforts to avoid the scope of international terrorism failed with the bombing of two synagogues .
but its commitment to european values and norms should be recognized in light of the tragedy . " even snakes leave worshipers in peace , " goes an old turkish saying .
seen as such , those responsible for the bombing attacks against faithful jews at two synagogues in istanbul are lower than snakes and have only their outside appearance in common with human beings .
there can be no justification and no understanding for the violent acts that destroyed two jewish religious institutions on the bosporous .
which organizations are behind the attack remains unclear .
but the fact that various groups are competing against each other to claim responsibility only heightens the blasphemy .
what is clear is that extremist groups and fanatics are as capable of igniting infernos in the largely muslim turkey as they are in the rest of the world .
it is impossible to understand what sort of fanaticism drives people to bring pain to others and destroy houses of worship .
the readiness for violence does n't even stop short of aid organizations and civilian peace groups , as was recently seen in iraq .
symbols like the red cross and red crescent on cars , or trucks with the u.n. emblem on the side are no longer a guarantee that they will be left unscathed by bombs , grenades or bullets .
fight against terror failed that turkey has long been the target of international terrorism is no secret .
the country has been trying for 80 years to find a peaceful co-existence between islam and democracy and regards itself as a model for other countries with islamic populations .
as a result , the shock within the islamic justice and development party of prime minister tayyip erdogan , is that much greater : the goal of taking turkey out of the gun sights of terrorism has failed .
more visibly than ever before , the attack on the synagogues shows how big a threat the secular foundation of the turkish republic is actually facing .
the nato nation that shares borders with middle east hotspots needs more than military protection and verbal commitments from the west .
turkey is europe the concrete ties between turkey and europe and the anchoring of european values and standards in turkish society should at the very latest be clear now , in light of the attacks in istanbul .
those who want to claim the values and standards of contemporary civilization exclusively for christianity , go against the christian teaching to love thy neighbor .
those who still want to block turkey 's progress towards europe on religious and cultural grounds , and use their rejection in election campaigns , are behaving irresponsibly .
turkey 's efforts to fulfill european expectations in areas such as human rights , democracy , minority protection rights and economic progress need to be attended to seriously and supported - there can be no alternative . baha güngör heads deutsche welle 's turkish program send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says cyprus could be obstacle to turkish bid the european union on wednesday praised recent reforms by turkey .
but in its annual expansion report , brussels said the country still had to make substantial progress before it could take up negotiations to join the eu .

semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .
according to handelsblatt , amd ceo hector ruiz recently described the existing plant as a " phenomenal success , " adding that " the factory has the highest productivity of any amd factory ever , as well delivering excellent production quality . " still competitive amd 's decision shows that despite high taxation and a costly social system , germany is still a competitive location for investors .
since the early 1990s , nearly 2,000 foreign companies from over 40 countries have invested in eastern germany , of which 300 are from the united states , including dow chemical , motorola , coca-cola and general motors .
other foreign investors include france 's vivendi and totalfinaelf , as well as japan 's sony and fujitsu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd factories in dresden represent a success story that contrasts starkly with the fate of a similar chip factory still under construction in the struggling east german state of brandenburg .
the project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , has failed to hand over funds and the plant is on hold until federal and state officials decide whether or not to act as guarantors . the microelectronics industry may be flourishing in the dresden region , but the problems in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- show that clusters have yet to emerge in eastern germany on a larger scale .
and according to the regional newspaper sächsische zeitung , the good news for dresden now almost certainly spells bad news for frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in terms of state subsidies . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hope dwindling for chip plant in eastern germany a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dw-world users help afghanistan afghanistan – facts and figures from mujahedeen to farmer 100 classrooms for afghanistan : donations still needed a school for lac laconth germany -pipe- 17.11.2003 germany paves the way for education in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tahey maskan school in kabul is just one of many educational projects financed by germany .
while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .

in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .

" lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "

semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .
according to handelsblatt , amd ceo hector ruiz recently described the existing plant as a " phenomenal success , " adding that " the factory has the highest productivity of any amd factory ever , as well delivering excellent production quality . " still competitive amd 's decision shows that despite high taxation and a costly social system , germany is still a competitive location for investors .
since the early 1990s , nearly 2,000 foreign companies from over 40 countries have invested in eastern germany , of which 300 are from the united states , including dow chemical , motorola , coca-cola and general motors .
other foreign investors include france 's vivendi and totalfinaelf , as well as japan 's sony and fujitsu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd factories in dresden represent a success story that contrasts starkly with the fate of a similar chip factory still under construction in the struggling east german state of brandenburg .
the project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , has failed to hand over funds and the plant is on hold until federal and state officials decide whether or not to act as guarantors . the microelectronics industry may be flourishing in the dresden region , but the problems in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- show that clusters have yet to emerge in eastern germany on a larger scale .
and according to the regional newspaper sächsische zeitung , the good news for dresden now almost certainly spells bad news for frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in terms of state subsidies . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hope dwindling for chip plant in eastern germany a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .

semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .
according to handelsblatt , amd ceo hector ruiz recently described the existing plant as a " phenomenal success , " adding that " the factory has the highest productivity of any amd factory ever , as well delivering excellent production quality .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .
this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .
milosevic has denied the legality of the court on many occasions , saying on one appearance : “ i consider this trial to be a false trial and these accusations to be false accusations .
they are illegal ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte stands during statements , after meeting with yugoslav justice minister savo markovic , in belgrade , thursday , april 18 , 2002 .

as the tribunal commemorates its ten year anniversary , chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- picture -rrb- continues to clash with the ex-president and his fellow detainees as she pushes for the maximum sentence allowed - life imprisonment .
it is a slow process to hear all the evidence and instigate the trials of the accused ; a process that will undoubtedly continue for many months to come . long , slow process to justice to date , 38 indicted war criminals are currently in the detention unit in the hague .
three of the indicted have been provisionally released .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .
this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .
milosevic has denied the legality of the court on many occasions , saying on one appearance : “ i consider this trial to be a false trial and these accusations to be false accusations .

not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "
the appreciative audience , nary a dissenting voice among them , responded with whoops and cheers .
this , like the rest of moore 's german tour stops , was going to be an easy crowd .
germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .
his book titles have etched themselves into the newsmagazine der spiegel 's bestseller lists , and " bowling for columbine " drew in half a million fans in the first two months after opening last year .

" it makes a lot of difference to have friends overseas supporting me . "
for the next hour , moore riffed , sang and joked his way through the topics that have become standard fare in his books and crowd favorites .
he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "

he warned germany not to " cut away the safety net . "
" do n't be like us , " he said .
" you 've got to stand up , right ?
you 've got to be brave . "
mixing in sports metaphors , moore said popular european sports like rugby and soccer revealed the old continent 's more cooperative , team-oriented approach to matters .
" in rugby , if someone gets tackled with the ball , he just throws it to the next person , " he said .

not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "
the appreciative audience , nary a dissenting voice among them , responded with whoops and cheers .
this , like the rest of moore 's german tour stops , was going to be an easy crowd .
germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .
his book titles have etched themselves into the newsmagazine der spiegel 's bestseller lists , and " bowling for columbine " drew in half a million fans in the first two months after opening last year .
all of which put moore , dressed in jeans , an untucked shirt and brown jacket , in a thankful mood sunday night at the columbia-halle in berlin .
" it has not been the easiest year in america to stand up and voice your dissent , " said moore , leaning his large frame into the podium .
" it makes a lot of difference to have friends overseas supporting me . "
for the next hour , moore riffed , sang and joked his way through the topics that have become standard fare in his books and crowd favorites .
he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "
germany , " do n't be like us " moore even took aim at the reforms chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition are trying to push through .
he warned germany not to " cut away the safety net . "
" do n't be like us , " he said .
" you 've got to stand up , right ?
you 've got to be brave . "
mixing in sports metaphors , moore said popular european sports like rugby and soccer revealed the old continent 's more cooperative , team-oriented approach to matters .
" in rugby , if someone gets tackled with the ball , he just throws it to the next person , " he said .
" ' no !
you go on without me ! " ' he sang , slipping into one of many over-the-top imitations that delighted the berlin crowd .

" it has not been the easiest year in america to stand up and voice your dissent , " said moore , leaning his large frame into the podium .
" it makes a lot of difference to have friends overseas supporting me . "
for the next hour , moore riffed , sang and joked his way through the topics that have become standard fare in his books and crowd favorites .
he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "
germany , " do n't be like us " moore even took aim at the reforms chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition are trying to push through .
he warned germany not to " cut away the safety net . "
" do n't be like us , " he said .
" you 've got to stand up , right ?
you 've got to be brave . "
mixing in sports metaphors , moore said popular european sports like rugby and soccer revealed the old continent 's more cooperative , team-oriented approach to matters .
" in rugby , if someone gets tackled with the ball , he just throws it to the next person , " he said .
" ' no !
you go on without me ! " ' he sang , slipping into one of many over-the-top imitations that delighted the berlin crowd .
too much showboating ?

-lrb- ap photo / mark j. terrill -rrb- " he 's an entertainer , " said german literature student janina alfen , 22 .
" he writes things that are funny to laugh about and later make you think . "
but moore 's alleged creative handling of the facts in his books and films , a standard criticism in the united states , is beginning to make its way across the atlantic .
german journalists , professors and critics have begun to take off the gloves when talking about the bestseller .
even devoted fans left feeling empty-handed after an appearance they felt was more entertainment than substance .
" i thought it was almost like a kind of cult .
he says somebody is crap and everyone cheers , " said max klemmt , a truck driver .
" i thought he would bring a few more examples and a bit more context . "
but for most , moore 's ranting against bush 's handling of the iraq war and his plan to unseat the incumbent president was enough .
" i think germany is sick of the whole iraq war thing , and they 're starting to see they were right , " said tarek ahmia , 37 , a music technician , after the show , " and finally an american comes along and confirms that .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .

this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .
milosevic has denied the legality of the court on many occasions , saying on one appearance : “ i consider this trial to be a false trial and these accusations to be false accusations .
they are illegal ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte stands during statements , after meeting with yugoslav justice minister savo markovic , in belgrade , thursday , april 18 , 2002 .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .

in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .

the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.11.2003 u.s. investor poised to build semiconductor plant in dresden großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amd is already at work in dresden , the former center of computer production for east germany .
semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .
according to handelsblatt , amd ceo hector ruiz recently described the existing plant as a " phenomenal success , " adding that " the factory has the highest productivity of any amd factory ever , as well delivering excellent production quality . " still competitive amd 's decision shows that despite high taxation and a costly social system , germany is still a competitive location for investors .
since the early 1990s , nearly 2,000 foreign companies from over 40 countries have invested in eastern germany , of which 300 are from the united states , including dow chemical , motorola , coca-cola and general motors .

semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .
according to handelsblatt , amd ceo hector ruiz recently described the existing plant as a " phenomenal success , " adding that " the factory has the highest productivity of any amd factory ever , as well delivering excellent production quality .

semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .

the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .
the group wants to turn the gigantic building into an amusement park called " tropical island , " complete with rainforests , lagoons and sandy beaches .

the park is expected to create 500 jobs .
the consortium is shouldering the € 70 million -lrb- $ 82.3 million -rrb- construction costs .

not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .

the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .

" lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .

not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "
the appreciative audience , nary a dissenting voice among them , responded with whoops and cheers .
this , like the rest of moore 's german tour stops , was going to be an easy crowd .
germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .
his book titles have etched themselves into the newsmagazine der spiegel 's bestseller lists , and " bowling for columbine " drew in half a million fans in the first two months after opening last year .
all of which put moore , dressed in jeans , an untucked shirt and brown jacket , in a thankful mood sunday night at the columbia-halle in berlin .
" it has not been the easiest year in america to stand up and voice your dissent , " said moore , leaning his large frame into the podium .

not everyone was impressed . if michael moore did n't have the mostly young berlin crowd on his side when he rumbled on to the stage of a sold-out berlin concert hall sunday night , his opening line brought over the stragglers .
" welcome , old europe ! "
moore said to cheers , a reference to u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld 's dig at germany for its iraq war opposition .
for the next hour , moore , 49 , delivered the expected dosage of bush and iraq war criticism to the first audiences of what will be a five-city german tour promoting his new book , " dude , where 's my country ? "
the appreciative audience , nary a dissenting voice among them , responded with whoops and cheers .
this , like the rest of moore 's german tour stops , was going to be an easy crowd .
germany 's favorite anti-american nowhere has moore 's entertaining , sound-byte light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buchcover : michael moore - stupid white men introspection been more successful than in germany .
riding on a wave of anti-bush sentiment around the iraq war , moore 's book " stupid white men " sold one million copies in germany before it did in the united states .
his book titles have etched themselves into the newsmagazine der spiegel 's bestseller lists , and " bowling for columbine " drew in half a million fans in the first two months after opening last year .
all of which put moore , dressed in jeans , an untucked shirt and brown jacket , in a thankful mood sunday night at the columbia-halle in berlin .
" it has not been the easiest year in america to stand up and voice your dissent , " said moore , leaning his large frame into the podium .
" it makes a lot of difference to have friends overseas supporting me . "
for the next hour , moore riffed , sang and joked his way through the topics that have become standard fare in his books and crowd favorites .
he mocked american ignorance by citing a national geographic geography study in which 70 percent could n't identify where the u.k. was on the map .
he slammed george w. bush for acting in god 's name in iraq , and read a chapter from his book he titled " jesus w. christ . "
germany , " do n't be like us " moore even took aim at the reforms chancellor gerhard schröder and his government coalition are trying to push through .
he warned germany not to " cut away the safety net . "
" do n't be like us , " he said .
" you 've got to stand up , right ?
you 've got to be brave . "
mixing in sports metaphors , moore said popular european sports like rugby and soccer revealed the old continent 's more cooperative , team-oriented approach to matters .
" in rugby , if someone gets tackled with the ball , he just throws it to the next person , " he said .
" ' no !
you go on without me ! " ' he sang , slipping into one of many over-the-top imitations that delighted the berlin crowd .
too much showboating ?

-lrb- ap photo / mark j. terrill -rrb- " he 's an entertainer , " said german literature student janina alfen , 22 .
" he writes things that are funny to laugh about and later make you think . "
but moore 's alleged creative handling of the facts in his books and films , a standard criticism in the united states , is beginning to make its way across the atlantic .
german journalists , professors and critics have begun to take off the gloves when talking about the bestseller .
even devoted fans left feeling empty-handed after an appearance they felt was more entertainment than substance .
" i thought it was almost like a kind of cult .
he says somebody is crap and everyone cheers , " said max klemmt , a truck driver .
" i thought he would bring a few more examples and a bit more context . "
but for most , moore 's ranting against bush 's handling of the iraq war and his plan to unseat the incumbent president was enough .
" i think germany is sick of the whole iraq war thing , and they 're starting to see they were right , " said tarek ahmia , 37 , a music technician , after the show , " and finally an american comes along and confirms that .

a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .
the half-built factory might join a growing list of unsuccessful investments aimed at creating jobs in this struggling region . a few minutes from the german-polish border , just outside the town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the chip factory is slowly taking shape next to a freeway .
the construction has provided hope to those living in the area , who face some of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
if the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project is completed , 1,300 people could find work here . but after years of negotiations , financing is still not in place and communicant , the plant 's operating company , might be insolvent as soon as the end of the month .
the emirate of dubai , the project 's biggest investor , has so far failed to inject more money . " we have n't filed for bankruptcy yet , " a spokesman for communicant , said this week . investor wants government as guarantor the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million -lrb- $ 250 million -rrb- in the plant , was supposed to hand over € 89 million -lrb- $ 105 million -rrb- in early november .
it has n't done so since it 's waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million -lrb- $ 763 million -rrb- loan .
federal and state officials have yet to decide on the matter . brandenburg itself has given € 40 million -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- to build the plant , which is intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , has contributed the same amount .
the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . a growing list of bad investments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lausitzring during better times .
the chip plant would not be the first investment project in brandenburg to fail .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , went bankrupt . " lausitzring , " hailed as europe 's most modern motor speedway , failed to lure big ticket events such as the formula 1 to its location in a former coal mining area in southern brandenburg .
only 40 people , not 1,500 as originally expected , found a job there .
the state of brandenburg covered most of the € 158 million -lrb- $ 168 million -rrb- construction costs . on friday , state government officials said the speedway should be leased out until a buyer has been found .
under the controversial deal , brandenburg would spend millions more to subsidize operations over the next five years .
" it 's clearly better to keep lausitzring open for business than shutting it down , " brandenburg 's minister of economics said . state and federal governments also pumped millions into cargolifter , an ambitious venture that news reports described as the " perfect money destruction machine . "
the company never produced any zeppelins at the site south of berlin .
in october , cargolifter 's brand-new furniture and machinery went on auction . will a tropical island save the day ? what 's left is one of the world 's largest cantilever construction halls .
an investor consortium from malaysia and britain claims it knows exactly what to do with it .
the group wants to turn the gigantic building into an amusement park called " tropical island , " complete with rainforests , lagoons and sandy beaches .

semiconductor maker advanced micro devices has announced plans to build a new chip plant in the eastern german city of dresden . if a german parliament committee gives the green light to the project by agreeing on a loan guarantee of some € 336 million -lrb- $ 397 million -rrb- , the groundbreaking ceremony for dresden 's new factory could be held as early as thursday . this will be the first new major chip plant in europe in several years . according to germany daily handelsblatt , amd , the world 's second largest pc manufacturer after intel , will be investing over € 2 billion in the new plant , the third largest single investment in eastern germany since the country 's unification in 1990 . last week , industry sources revealed that amd had short-listed east fishkill in new york and the saxon city of dresden - where unemployment is currently hovering at around 13 percent - as possible locations for a new chip plant .
a spokesman for amd in germany confirmed at the weekend the company was holding talks about a new plant but declined to give details . according to industry sources , the federal and state governments will jointly guarantee up to 80 percent of a € 700 million loan package for the new plant , while the u.s. chip maker can also count on further grants of more than € 100 million . reaping benefits amd already employs some 2,000 people in its existing , ultra-modern dresden plant , which opened in 1996 to the tune of € 2.2 billion - € 400 million of which was provided by the state of saxony with a minimum of red tape . dresden is also home to an advanced memory chip factory of german chip maker infineon technologies , as well as an infineon and dupont photomasks factory .
the new amd plant will create several hundred jobs in the depressed eastern state and consolidate dresden 's standing as europe 's main center for microelectronics , a reputation first established by east germany 's ruling sed party during the communist years with companies such as robotron dresden . experts say the decision may well be thanks to amd 's positive track record with the saxon authorities and the success of the existing plant , which also enjoys a constructive working relationship with dresden 's internationally renowned technical university .
according to handelsblatt , amd ceo hector ruiz recently described the existing plant as a " phenomenal success , " adding that " the factory has the highest productivity of any amd factory ever , as well delivering excellent production quality . " still competitive amd 's decision shows that despite high taxation and a costly social system , germany is still a competitive location for investors .
since the early 1990s , nearly 2,000 foreign companies from over 40 countries have invested in eastern germany , of which 300 are from the united states , including dow chemical , motorola , coca-cola and general motors .
other foreign investors include france 's vivendi and totalfinaelf , as well as japan 's sony and fujitsu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the amd factories in dresden represent a success story that contrasts starkly with the fate of a similar chip factory still under construction in the struggling east german state of brandenburg .
the project 's main investor , the emirate of dubai , has failed to hand over funds and the plant is on hold until federal and state officials decide whether or not to act as guarantors . the microelectronics industry may be flourishing in the dresden region , but the problems in frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- show that clusters have yet to emerge in eastern germany on a larger scale .
and according to the regional newspaper sächsische zeitung , the good news for dresden now almost certainly spells bad news for frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- in terms of state subsidies . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hope dwindling for chip plant in eastern germany a massive project to build a chip factory in eastern germany is running out of funds .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .
this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .
milosevic has denied the legality of the court on many occasions , saying on one appearance : “ i consider this trial to be a false trial and these accusations to be false accusations .
they are illegal ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte stands during statements , after meeting with yugoslav justice minister savo markovic , in belgrade , thursday , april 18 , 2002 .

as the tribunal commemorates its ten year anniversary , chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- picture -rrb- continues to clash with the ex-president and his fellow detainees as she pushes for the maximum sentence allowed - life imprisonment .
it is a slow process to hear all the evidence and instigate the trials of the accused ; a process that will undoubtedly continue for many months to come . long , slow process to justice to date , 38 indicted war criminals are currently in the detention unit in the hague .
three of the indicted have been provisionally released .
the judges have so far reached 19 guilty verdicts and ordered two acquittals . as the search continues for suspects and justice , it is quite possible that the united nations tribunal for war crimes will mark its 20th anniversary with alleged serbian war criminals sitting in the cells below it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctant unlocking of serbia 's secret past by the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime , serbian secret police had files on 400,000 of the country 's citizens .

the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .
this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .
milosevic has denied the legality of the court on many occasions , saying on one appearance : “ i consider this trial to be a false trial and these accusations to be false accusations .
they are illegal ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte stands during statements , after meeting with yugoslav justice minister savo markovic , in belgrade , thursday , april 18 , 2002 .
del ponte arrived to belgrade to press anew for the extradition of war crimes suspects , including top fugitives accused of genocide in the bosnian war .
as the tribunal commemorates its ten year anniversary , chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- picture -rrb- continues to clash with the ex-president and his fellow detainees as she pushes for the maximum sentence allowed - life imprisonment .
it is a slow process to hear all the evidence and instigate the trials of the accused ; a process that will undoubtedly continue for many months to come . long , slow process to justice to date , 38 indicted war criminals are currently in the detention unit in the hague .
three of the indicted have been provisionally released .
the judges have so far reached 19 guilty verdicts and ordered two acquittals . as the search continues for suspects and justice , it is quite possible that the united nations tribunal for war crimes will mark its 20th anniversary with alleged serbian war criminals sitting in the cells below it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctant unlocking of serbia 's secret past by the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime , serbian secret police had files on 400,000 of the country 's citizens .

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "

while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dw-world users help afghanistan afghanistan – facts and figures from mujahedeen to farmer 100 classrooms for afghanistan : donations still needed a school for lac laconth germany -pipe- 17.11.2003 germany paves the way for education in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tahey maskan school in kabul is just one of many educational projects financed by germany .
while the army takes on an extended military mandate in afghanistan , germany keeps up a quiet but comprehensive educational mission in the ravaged country . in an interview with associated press , wilfried grolig , head of culture and education at the german foreign ministry , described germany 's efforts to promote education in afghanistan as pioneering , saying that germany is " by far the most active nation in terms of afghanistan 's higher education . "
" the gentle power of culture " germany 's commitment reflects a long history of positive german-afghan relations .
today , germany is home to some 90,000 people of afghan origin - more than any other country in europe .
after the taliban regime was toppled in late 2001 , germany was a major player in drawing up the international community 's reconstruction plans , even hosting the united nations talks on afghanistan held outside bonn in november that same year .
grolig emphasizes that the foreign ministry now sees it as its task to contribute to stability in the war-torn country , and bases its policy on civilian crisis prevention .
spending some € 8.8 million in 2002 and € 9.2 million in 2003 so far , the ministry earmarks almost two thirds of its afghanistan budget for reconstruction of cultural and educational projects .
by building schools , colleges and a media infrastructure designed to promote human rights and encourage the participation of women , germany is investing in the future of the country .
in kandahar , for example , berlin is financing a number of educational projects especially for women , including a residential college and twenty mobile women 's centers .
goethe institute back on map in 2002 , the goethe institute was the first foreign cultural institute to reopen in kabul .
until its closing in 1990 amid the repression of the taliban , the goethe institute for german language and culture had been extremely popular - and it now hopes to reestablish itself on the afghan capital 's educational map .
at the official opening center , wolfgang bader , deputy secretary general of the institute , stressed that " the focus is on the common search for a new way forward after more than twenty years of war and destruction , a way forward which draws on the gentle power of culture . "
the amani school for boys , which opened in 2003 , and the aysha-i-durani school for girls also both enjoy german backing .
in the last two years , over 200 students and teachers have visited germany as part of further training programs and grants provided by the daad -lrb- german academic exchange service -rrb- .
germany has also awarded more scholarships to afghan university staff than any other country .
in turn , a number of german lecturers now teach at kabul university , where the technical university berlin is also helping set up a computer center .
creating a media infrastructure in 2003 , the aid organization cap anamur , which has been working in the northern provinces of afghanistan since late 2001 , launched an initiative in cooperation with deutsche welle to collect donations to help fund 100 classrooms in afghanistan , especially in rural regions outside kabul .
earlier this year , the foreign ministry and deutsche welle also set up media training centers for journalists and technicians in seven afghan provinces .
deutsche welle is also the only foreign media providing afghanistan 's public broadcasters with daily news bulletins in dari and pashtu .
preserving cultural heritage the foreign ministry has been quick to support projects aimed at restoring the country 's beleaguered cultural heritage .
grolig stresses its importance " for the country 's rediscovered national identity " .
projects include reconstruction of kabul 's only park - the 16th century gardens of the first mughal emperor babur - where the first german delegation to visit afghanistan stayed in 1923 .
another historical preservation project with german funding is the restoration of the 15th century mausoleum of princess gawhar shad in herat .
with its comprehensive efforts to reintroduce a functioning civil society in the country , germany is building on a relationship that dates back many decades .
" many afghans , and particularly the older generation , " says grolig , " told me they have many good memories of german projects in afghanistan before the civil war . "
he adds that the projects currently in operation now give plenty of " grounds for hope .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.11.2003 ten years on : the fight for justice in the balkans continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a decade after its inception , the war crimes tribunal is still dealing with the horror of the balkan wars .
the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .
this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .
milosevic has denied the legality of the court on many occasions , saying on one appearance : “ i consider this trial to be a false trial and these accusations to be false accusations .
they are illegal ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte stands during statements , after meeting with yugoslav justice minister savo markovic , in belgrade , thursday , april 18 , 2002 .

but its commitment to european values and norms should be recognized in light of the tragedy . " even snakes leave worshipers in peace , " goes an old turkish saying .
seen as such , those responsible for the bombing attacks against faithful jews at two synagogues in istanbul are lower than snakes and have only their outside appearance in common with human beings .
there can be no justification and no understanding for the violent acts that destroyed two jewish religious institutions on the bosporous .
which organizations are behind the attack remains unclear .
but the fact that various groups are competing against each other to claim responsibility only heightens the blasphemy .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .
and , as well as duplicating charges to those brought in reference to croatia , milosevic was accused of genocide , principally based on the bosnian serb assault on the tiny muslim village of srebrenica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic .
the international red cross says about 7,000 muslim men and boys remain unaccounted for after soldiers under the command of milosevic-backed bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic -lrb- picture -rrb- and his military chief , radko mladic , swept through the village . kosovo 1999 after losing bosnia and croatia , and with the republic in tatters , milosevic then turned to kosovo in 1999 .
this time , the west had had enough and nato launched an air campaign , plunging the continent into conflict for the first time in over 50 years . after 74 days of bombing , milosevic capitulated .
in the post-war void , united nations observers swarmed over the country , setting up on-site investigations .
the evidence gathered went towards the final indictment brought against the former dictator - a third charge for crimes against humanity . ex-dictator denies court 's legality since his arrest in april 2000 , milosevic has appeared sporadically in the hague ’ s courtroom due to continuing illness .
on the occasions he has appeared , he has defended himself and has issued three “ not guilty ” pleas to the charges brought against him for crimes in croatia , bosnia and kosovo .
milosevic has denied the legality of the court on many occasions , saying on one appearance : “ i consider this trial to be a false trial and these accusations to be false accusations .
they are illegal ! ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte stands during statements , after meeting with yugoslav justice minister savo markovic , in belgrade , thursday , april 18 , 2002 .
del ponte arrived to belgrade to press anew for the extradition of war crimes suspects , including top fugitives accused of genocide in the bosnian war .
as the tribunal commemorates its ten year anniversary , chief prosecutor carla del ponte -lrb- picture -rrb- continues to clash with the ex-president and his fellow detainees as she pushes for the maximum sentence allowed - life imprisonment .
it is a slow process to hear all the evidence and instigate the trials of the accused ; a process that will undoubtedly continue for many months to come . long , slow process to justice to date , 38 indicted war criminals are currently in the detention unit in the hague .
three of the indicted have been provisionally released .
the judges have so far reached 19 guilty verdicts and ordered two acquittals . as the search continues for suspects and justice , it is quite possible that the united nations tribunal for war crimes will mark its 20th anniversary with alleged serbian war criminals sitting in the cells below it . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the reluctant unlocking of serbia 's secret past by the end of slobodan milosevic 's regime , serbian secret police had files on 400,000 of the country 's citizens .

also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .

after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .

the u.n. tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia marks its ten-year anniversary this week , but it 's business as usual in the hague as the trials of those accused of atrocities in the balkan wars continue . on november 17 , 1993 , the united nations tribunal for war crimes in the former yugoslavia began its unenviable task of searching for and bringing to justice those people responsible for horrific acts during almost 15 years of conflict . from its base in the dutch capital of the hague , the tribunal stretched its rule of law across europe and with the help of united nations and nato troops on the ground in the war-torn balkans ; it started the largest search for war criminals the continent had seen since the fall of the third reich in germany . ten years on , the tribunal is still the nerve center behind the special forces squads who continue to comb the balkan hillsides and suburbs hunting for the ex-army officers and politicians who remain at large , men who are wanted for the worst war crimes in europe in a generation .
and , as if to emphasize the enormity of the task the tribunal was given ten years ago , the hague is still the focus for cases involving those who have been apprehended . milosevic indicted on three counts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic .
the most famous of those who have been brought in to answer for their actions is a man who went by many titles - president of the federal republic of yugoslavia , supreme commander of the yugoslav army , president of the supreme defense council - but a man known to many only by the one name , a name synonymous with the catastrophic loss of life of thousands of people : slobodan milosevic . the last time milosevic visited the hague as a free man was for a peace conference 10 years ago .
he was president of yugoslavia .
the yugoslav wars were just starting .
and there was no united nations war crimes tribunal . when he returned in february 2002 , after almost 13 years of unchallenged power , the 62-year-old ex-dictator was brought before the tribunal to face charges accumulated during a rule which had set his country on a course of conflict and violent disintegration . croatia 1991 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first of the three charges for which he currently stands trial arises from the 1991 conflict instigated by milosevic in croatia .
after the republic declared independence from milosevic ’ s yugoslavia , the serb minority in croatia looked to their ethnic leader for support , fearing for their existence .
milosevic ’ s response was to send in the yugoslav people 's army to fight for a country for the serbs , over-running croatian forces by the end of the year .
up to 20,000 people were killed , and 400,000 people made homeless during the war . the united nations took a very dim view of the conflict and imposed economic sanctions on yugoslavia .
also , u.n. observers began compiling reports of milosevic ’ s brutality from survivors and refugees , which would eventually form the basis of the charges brought against him in reference to croatia . eight years after it had been set up , the tribunal brought the first indictment against milosevic for crimes in croatia .
he was charged on the basis of “ individual criminal responsibility and superior criminal responsibility with grave breaches of the 1949 geneva conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity . ” bosnia 1992 despite international outrage and the u.n. sanctions at the end of the croatian war , milosevic trail of destruction was by no means finished .
after bosnia ’ s declaration of independence by referendum in april 1992 , violence broke out across yet another former republic . again milosevic chose to defend the serbs living in bosnia from what he called " islamic fundamentalism " by unleashing three years of war , the bloodiest in europe since world war ii , and effectively dissolving what was left of the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the tribunal held a hearing on the extent of atrocities carried out in bosnia in the second indictment brought before the court in november 2001 .

the avon longitudinal study of parents and children -lrb- alspac -rrb- , also known as the children of the 90s project , maps the life of the children .
the robots - named the germinator and the robobanker - will help researchers improve their understanding of human molecular biology .
the germinator grows tissue to produce dna while the robobanker extracts samples for analysis .
a spokesman for the bristol university-based project said the robots were designed to provide an unlimited supply of dna from 10,000 children and their mothers " no other study in the world has such a large dna collection from a normal population - or such a sophisticated system for growing human cell lines .
" over the last 12 years the study has collected 500,000 biological samples from parents and children - everything from placentas to milk teeth .
" with the advent of the human genome project , and the progress made in identifying genetic variations , the bristol scientists realised they would need a constant supply of dna . "
dr richard jones , of the alspac project , said : " the amount of dna currently in the alspac bank is sufficient for us to analyse about 500 genes .
" but our worry is that with 30,000 human genes and the discovery of more and more common genetic variants , we will start to run out of dna .
" the solution is to make ' immortalised ' cell lines from blood cells collected from the children of the 90s . "

the firm reported a pre-tax profit of £ 26m for the six months to 30 september compared with a £ 259m loss in the same period last year .
the result was helped by a 13 % jump in customer numbers to 19.2 million .
but mmo2 warned it faced fierce competition in the second half of the year which could slow revenue growth .
growing income " in the second half we expect intense competition in our two main markets , but we are aiming to build on what we achieved in the first half , and deliver our full-year growth and margin targets , " said chief executive peter erskine .
the company has previously warned that its uk revenues will be hit by cheaper call charges which were imposed by the telecoms regulator oftel .
and competitors such as hutchison 's 3 uk have been launching aggressive pricing strategies in an attempt to increase market share .
" frankly , i think you 'd think we were naive if we did n't recognise that , " mr erskine said .
" but i do n't want any sense that there 's anything bleak out there . "

william wilkins claims those in charge of the cash-strapped project have failed to deliver his dream .
the £ 42m garden , which opened at middleton in carmarthenshire three years ago , could shut in a matter of weeks following months of financial problems .
in october , the 10-acre attraction won a last-minute reprieve after organisers had rejected a £ 150,000 rescue package from carmarthenshire county council .
visitor numbers exceeded 200,000 in the garden 's first year , but have been dropping off ever since , and original project director mr wilkins claimed he knows why .
" the visitors are n't coming because the original master plan has not been delivered , " he said .
" you ca n't criticise it for failing to bring in the visitors if you have n't got what was originally envisaged . "
the wrong decisions were taken because it has n't delivered the quality , even if it has consumed the money " william wilkins " i can see money has been spent on elements that i do n't think it should have been spent on .
" it lacks cascades , which should have descended from the south front of the great glasshouse .
" it lacks the restoration of the great 18th century lake - it lacks all the picturesque walks associated with them .
" quite clearly , the wrong decisions were taken because it has n't delivered something of the quality , even if it has consumed the money . "
brian charles , the deputy chair of trustees , said things could have been done differently .
" it takes a long time to grow a garden , " he said .
" had we had the time , it might have been better to have left the garden until it had developed a bit more .
" but we opened because it was a millennium project and it was the millennium . "
mr charles defended the project , saying it had been built " to time and to budget " .
if the garden does close , it could have serious implications for the tourist industry in the area .
berwyn jones , manager of ivy bush royal hotel in carmarthen admitted he was worried about the future of the attraction .
" we have a major refurbishment programme going on now .
" if this garden closes down , it could affect our business quite considerably , " he said .
welsh culture minister alun pugh definitely ruled out changing the garden 's status and giving it the same type of public backing as the national museums and galleries of wales .

william wilkins claims those in charge of the cash-strapped project have failed to deliver his dream .
the £ 42m garden , which opened at middleton in carmarthenshire three years ago , could shut in a matter of weeks following months of financial problems .
in october , the 10-acre attraction won a last-minute reprieve after organisers had rejected a £ 150,000 rescue package from carmarthenshire county council .
visitor numbers exceeded 200,000 in the garden 's first year , but have been dropping off ever since , and original project director mr wilkins claimed he knows why .
" the visitors are n't coming because the original master plan has not been delivered , " he said .
" you ca n't criticise it for failing to bring in the visitors if you have n't got what was originally envisaged .
the wrong decisions were taken because it has n't delivered the quality , even if it has consumed the money william wilkins " i can see money has been spent on elements that i do n't think it should have been spent on .
" it lacks cascades , which should have descended from the south front of the great glasshouse .
" it lacks the restoration of the great 18th century lake - it lacks all the picturesque walks associated with them .
" quite clearly , the wrong decisions were taken because it has n't delivered something of the quality , even if it has consumed the money . "
brian charles , the deputy chair of trustees , said things could have been done differently .
" it takes a long time to grow a garden , " he said .
" had we had the time , it might have been better to have left the garden until it had developed a bit more .
" but we opened because it was a millennium project and it was the millennium . "
visitor numbers exceeded 200,000 in the garden 's first year mr charles defended the project , saying it had been built " to time and to budget " .
if the garden does close , it could have serious implications for the tourist industry in the area .
berwyn jones , manager of ivy bush royal hotel in carmarthen admitted he was worried about the future of the attraction .
" we have a major refurbishment programme going on now .
" if this garden closes down , it could affect our business quite considerably , " he said .

" but the severe business conditions , under which corporate profits are on a downtrend , has not improved , and the realisation of bankruptcies among small- and medium-sized companies has been only postponed by government aid , " it said .
poor sales debts owed by companies that went bankrupt in october came to 851 bn yen , down 55.8 % from a year earlier .
the figures cover companies which failed owing 10 mn yen or more .
teikoku said business conditions remain harsh , with three-quarters of bankruptcies caused by recession-linked factors , such as poor sales or swelling bad loans .
only one listed company collapsed in october - morimoto corporation , a construction company listed on the osaka stock exchange .
bankruptcies in the construction sector declined 19.7 % contributing to the overall fall in october .
overseas trade on friday it was announced that japan 's battered economy had grown for the seventh quarter in a row thanks to continued demand for japanese goods in china and the us .
for the three months to september , gdp was up 0.6 % from the previous quarter , making an annual rate of 2.2 % .
economists said that domestic spending was also climbing , albeit at a slower rate than the impact of overseas trade .

safety campaigners were flagging up the findings in a bid to raise awareness of the personal destruction of fire in the home .
some 87 % of scots said they would be more devastated to lose unique and irreplaceable personal effects , such as letters or children 's mementoes rather than televisions , cds or designer clothing that can be replaced .

charities including the british lung foundation are urging the government to provide more so-called pet scanners , which spot tumours easily .
there are only five such scanners in nhs hospitals in england and wales , but 80 in germany and 160 in the us .
ministers say it is up to local health authorities to choose to buy the kit , which costs millions of pounds .
lung cancer kills about 1.3 million people worldwide each year , more than any other cancer .
it needs to be spotted quickly , as it is difficult to treat and survival rates are low .
pet -lrb- positron emission tomography -rrb- scanners produce 3-d images to either detect disease , or to find out how widespread a disease is in a patient 's body .
i had to wait around eight weeks for my pet scan and a three-hour journey each way to check whether my lung cancer operation was successful patient dennis stowell former leading surgeon jules dussek said : " i have been pet scanning every lung cancer patient coming to surgery for 10 years , the longest experience of anyone in the uk and almost anywhere .
" i would be very unhappy if i would be forced to operate on someone with lung cancer without a pet scan .
i would feel naked and defenceless . "
dennis stowell , from taunton , somerset , had to travel to london for his pet scan .
" we really need to spread them all over the country .
" i had to wait around eight weeks for my pet scan and a three-hour journey each way to check whether my lung cancer operation was successful , " he said .
dr jesme baird , of the roy castle lung cancer foundation , says lung cancer does not receive the same attention as other cancers and diseases because it is stigmatised by its association with tobacco .
lung cancer - the facts kills 1.3m people worldwide each year about 38,000 new cases diagnosed in uk each year 80 % of uk sufferers die within a year of diagnosis only six out of 100 uk sufferers survive the disease she also says patients do not survive long enough to make a stand about better research and treatments .
she told bbc breakfast : " if we can pick up this disease early we know we can cure people , so what we really need to be doing is investing in raising awareness and investing in better techniques for diagnosing the disease .
we will improve outcomes for this disease if we do that .
" if you 're diagnosed with lung cancer you want to make sure that treatments and services are available for you so that you have the best chance of survival .
" what we 're saying today is that there really needs to be more investment in terms of research and treatment so that we have something to offer these patients . "
' self-inflicted ' charities including macmillan cancer relief , the british lung foundation and cancerbacup have joined forces to call for more pet scanners to be provided they urged the government to set out a strategy to make sure at least 15 pet scanners were available across england and wales within five years .
in the meantime , the government is still spending millions of pounds reinforcing the anti-smoking message .
ministers say that while treatment is important , the focus must also be on preventing the 38,000 new cases of lung cancer each year .
but some doctors feel that because some see lung cancer brought on by smoking as a self-inflicted disease , it is missing out on funding .
government response professor mike richards , the government 's cancer czar , told the bbc the government was determined to prevent lung cancer through boosting smoking cessation programmes , and to improve services for patients who have developed symptoms .
he said as yet there was no conclusive proof that widespread early screening was necessarily an effective use of resources .
but he said : " we are developing a framework for pet scanning in this country , looking at how many scanners we really need , and also where they should best be located so that patients can have access to pet scanning . "
professor richards also said an expert group to advise on the best way forward was to be established .

she told bbc breakfast : " if we can pick up this disease early we know we can cure people , so what we really need to be doing is investing in raising awareness and investing in better techniques for diagnosing the disease .
we will improve outcomes for this disease if we do that .
" if you 're diagnosed with lung cancer you want to make sure that treatments and services are available for you so that you have the best chance of survival .
" what we 're saying today is that there really needs to be more investment in terms of research and treatment so that we have something to offer these patients . "
' self-inflicted ' charities including macmillan cancer relief , the british lung foundation and cancerbacup have joined forces to call for more pet scanners to be provided they urged the government to set out a strategy to make sure at least 15 pet scanners were available across england and wales within five years .
in the meantime , the government is still spending millions of pounds reinforcing the anti-smoking message .
ministers say that while treatment is important , the focus must also be on preventing the 38,000 new cases of lung cancer each year .
but some doctors feel that because some see lung cancer brought on by smoking as a self-inflicted disease , it is missing out on funding .
government response professor mike richards , the government 's cancer czar , told the bbc the government was determined to prevent lung cancer through boosting smoking cessation programmes , and to improve services for patients who have developed symptoms .
he said as yet there was no conclusive proof that widespread early screening was necessarily an effective use of resources .
but he said : " we are developing a framework for pet scanning in this country , looking at how many scanners we really need , and also where they should best be located so that patients can have access to pet scanning . "
professor richards also said an expert group to advise on the best way forward was to be established .
