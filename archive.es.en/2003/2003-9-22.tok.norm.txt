“ we hope that the opposition doesn ’ t try to sink the agenda 2010 at every turn , but rather constructively complements it , ” said rogowski in berlin , according to the german news agency dpa .
saying chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s so-called agenda 2010 was only the beginning of necessary reforms , rogowski also presented the bdi ’ s own suggestions to help get the moribund german economy going .
he said the group ’ s most important goal was to lower the amount of government spending as a share of gross domestic product from its current 48 percent to 40 percent by 2010 .
in order to spark growth , rogowski said , social security non-wage labor costs should fall to 35 percent and the highest tax rate should drop to 30 percent . more briefs 22.09.2003 -pipe- german regulator watching deutsche 's ackermann 22.09.2003 -pipe- ecb 's vanhala : german , french deficits endanger growth 19.09.2003 -pipe- china signs on as galileo investor 19.09.2003 -pipe- germany calls on u.s. to tighten belt 19.09.2003 -pipe- belgium 's interbrew acquires munich 's spaten beer 18.09.2003 -pipe- bayer wins latest round in lipobay fight 18.09.2003 -pipe- vw appeal against antitrust fine rejected 18.09.2003 -pipe- .info opens market for german domain names radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

vanhala , who was attending the annual meeting of the international monetary fund and the world bank in dubai , told bloomberg news that german and french plans to spark growth by cutting taxes could backfire if the euro zone ’ s two largest economies continued to breach european union deficit limits .
“ it ’ s a double-edged sword .
there is a continuous risk that this trend will start to spill over into interest rates , ” he said .
“ if they can present credible , strong plans for fiscal consolidation , that will restore confidence . ”
officials at the ecb are concerned both germany and france could top the eu ’ s 3 percent of gross domestic product deficit limit for a third consecutive year in 2004 . more briefs 19.09.2003 -pipe- china signs on as galileo investor 19.09.2003 -pipe- germany calls on u.s. to tighten belt 19.09.2003 -pipe- belgium 's interbrew acquires munich 's spaten beer 18.09.2003 -pipe- bayer wins latest round in lipobay fight 18.09.2003 -pipe- vw appeal against antitrust fine rejected 18.09.2003 -pipe- .info opens market for german domain names 18.09.2003 -pipe- e-plus extends german gsm / gprs network 17.09.2003 -pipe- report : proposed eu laws threaten chemical industry radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the landslide win for conservatives in bavaria ’ s local elections leaves the ruling social democrat party reeling – and calling for changes . with a final result of 60.7 percent of the votes , bavaria ’ s christian social union won its first-ever two-thirds majority in a state parliament .
the result marked the csu ’ s strongest showing since world war ii . the broad win boosts bavaria ’ s state premier edmund stoiber ’ s standing as a potential challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in the next federal election . a win for the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national christian democratic union , was certain from the get-go , but the overwhelming numbers were a blow to the spd .
it made its weakest post-war showing to date , garnering just 19.7 percent of the vote in germany ’ s second-largest state .
the green party edged higher , to 7.7 percent of the vote .
none of the other parties got enough votes to win parliamentary seats . criticism , and calls from within the spd for policy changes , followed on the heels of the stinging defeat as schröder himself accepted responsibility for the result .
yet he vowed to continue on his present course for reform . ' historic dismantling ' of spd the chairman of the spd in the state of saarland , heiko maas , told the berliner zeitung the low numbers represent the further “ historic dismantling of the spd ” that had already begun with devastating losses in the states of hesse and lower saxony in february . he blamed the federal government ’ s reform policies for the defeat , noting that the reforms are alienating typical spd voters .
“ that includes the contents of the policies , but also the way in which they are communicated . something there is going wrong , ” he said . indeed , voter turnout for the bavaria election was reported at an all-time low of 57 percent . “ i ’ ve thought several times that -lrb- the spd -rrb- had hit bottom . but you can always be negatively surprised , ” maas said . more than a local result germany ’ s minister for family affairs , renate schmidt , also pinned the loss on national , rather than local , issues . “ it isn ’ t necessarily a bavarian result ” said schmidt .
rather , the result reflects germans ’ uneasiness with schröder ’ s announced agenda 2010 package of health , welfare and pension reforms . “ people understand theoretically that we need to initiate reforms .
and theoretically they understand the need for spending cuts .
but they don ’ t want to admit that these cuts should apply to them . ” schröder : ' bitter defeat ' schröder also accepted the blame for the result , calling it a “ bitter defeat for the spd . ”
however , he said he will stick to his planned reform course despite the internal criticisms . germany is “ in the middle off a difficult reform phase ” which stands to affect a lot of people , and “ people are afraid of changes , ” schröder said .
but economic growth and jobs can only be created through implementation of the agenda 2010 reforms , he said . blessing in disguise ? indeed , despite internal disappointment , sunday ’ s vote may well open the way for schröder to steer the stalled reform package through parliament this autumn .
the conservative opposition can block most of the measures through their control of the upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat . talks were at a standstill in the run-up to the election , as stoiber tried to avoid taking a stance on potentially unpopular cuts - many of which his party avidly supports . with the election behind them , however , the road is now open for negotiations between the social democrats and the conservatives .

the landslide win for conservatives in bavaria ’ s local elections leaves the ruling social democrat party reeling – and calling for changes . with a final result of 60.7 percent of the votes , bavaria ’ s christian social union won its first-ever two-thirds majority in a state parliament .
the result marked the csu ’ s strongest showing since world war ii . the broad win boosts bavaria ’ s state premier edmund stoiber ’ s standing as a potential challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in the next federal election . a win for the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national christian democratic union , was certain from the get-go , but the overwhelming numbers were a blow to the spd .
it made its weakest post-war showing to date , garnering just 19.7 percent of the vote in germany ’ s second-largest state .
the green party edged higher , to 7.7 percent of the vote .
none of the other parties got enough votes to win parliamentary seats . criticism , and calls from within the spd for policy changes , followed on the heels of the stinging defeat as schröder himself accepted responsibility for the result .
yet he vowed to continue on his present course for reform . ' historic dismantling ' of spd the chairman of the spd in the state of saarland , heiko maas , told the berliner zeitung the low numbers represent the further “ historic dismantling of the spd ” that had already begun with devastating losses in the states of hesse and lower saxony in february . he blamed the federal government ’ s reform policies for the defeat , noting that the reforms are alienating typical spd voters .
“ that includes the contents of the policies , but also the way in which they are communicated . something there is going wrong , ” he said . indeed , voter turnout for the bavaria election was reported at an all-time low of 57 percent . “ i ’ ve thought several times that -lrb- the spd -rrb- had hit bottom . but you can always be negatively surprised , ” maas said . more than a local result germany ’ s minister for family affairs , renate schmidt , also pinned the loss on national , rather than local , issues . “ it isn ’ t necessarily a bavarian result ” said schmidt .
rather , the result reflects germans ’ uneasiness with schröder ’ s announced agenda 2010 package of health , welfare and pension reforms . “ people understand theoretically that we need to initiate reforms .
and theoretically they understand the need for spending cuts .
but they don ’ t want to admit that these cuts should apply to them . ” schröder : ' bitter defeat ' schröder also accepted the blame for the result , calling it a “ bitter defeat for the spd . ”
however , he said he will stick to his planned reform course despite the internal criticisms . germany is “ in the middle off a difficult reform phase ” which stands to affect a lot of people , and “ people are afraid of changes , ” schröder said .
but economic growth and jobs can only be created through implementation of the agenda 2010 reforms , he said . blessing in disguise ? indeed , despite internal disappointment , sunday ’ s vote may well open the way for schröder to steer the stalled reform package through parliament this autumn .
the conservative opposition can block most of the measures through their control of the upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat . talks were at a standstill in the run-up to the election , as stoiber tried to avoid taking a stance on potentially unpopular cuts - many of which his party avidly supports . with the election behind them , however , the road is now open for negotiations between the social democrats and the conservatives .

the landslide win for conservatives in bavaria ’ s local elections leaves the ruling social democrat party reeling – and calling for changes . with a final result of 60.7 percent of the votes , bavaria ’ s christian social union won its first-ever two-thirds majority in a state parliament .
the result marked the csu ’ s strongest showing since world war ii . the broad win boosts bavaria ’ s state premier edmund stoiber ’ s standing as a potential challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in the next federal election . a win for the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national christian democratic union , was certain from the get-go , but the overwhelming numbers were a blow to the spd .
it made its weakest post-war showing to date , garnering just 19.7 percent of the vote in germany ’ s second-largest state .
the green party edged higher , to 7.7 percent of the vote .
none of the other parties got enough votes to win parliamentary seats . criticism , and calls from within the spd for policy changes , followed on the heels of the stinging defeat as schröder himself accepted responsibility for the result .
yet he vowed to continue on his present course for reform . ' historic dismantling ' of spd the chairman of the spd in the state of saarland , heiko maas , told the berliner zeitung the low numbers represent the further “ historic dismantling of the spd ” that had already begun with devastating losses in the states of hesse and lower saxony in february . he blamed the federal government ’ s reform policies for the defeat , noting that the reforms are alienating typical spd voters .
“ that includes the contents of the policies , but also the way in which they are communicated . something there is going wrong , ” he said . indeed , voter turnout for the bavaria election was reported at an all-time low of 57 percent . “ i ’ ve thought several times that -lrb- the spd -rrb- had hit bottom . but you can always be negatively surprised , ” maas said . more than a local result germany ’ s minister for family affairs , renate schmidt , also pinned the loss on national , rather than local , issues . “ it isn ’ t necessarily a bavarian result ” said schmidt .
rather , the result reflects germans ’ uneasiness with schröder ’ s announced agenda 2010 package of health , welfare and pension reforms . “ people understand theoretically that we need to initiate reforms .
and theoretically they understand the need for spending cuts .
but they don ’ t want to admit that these cuts should apply to them . ” schröder : ' bitter defeat ' schröder also accepted the blame for the result , calling it a “ bitter defeat for the spd . ”
however , he said he will stick to his planned reform course despite the internal criticisms . germany is “ in the middle off a difficult reform phase ” which stands to affect a lot of people , and “ people are afraid of changes , ” schröder said .
but economic growth and jobs can only be created through implementation of the agenda 2010 reforms , he said . blessing in disguise ? indeed , despite internal disappointment , sunday ’ s vote may well open the way for schröder to steer the stalled reform package through parliament this autumn .
the conservative opposition can block most of the measures through their control of the upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat . talks were at a standstill in the run-up to the election , as stoiber tried to avoid taking a stance on potentially unpopular cuts - many of which his party avidly supports . with the election behind them , however , the road is now open for negotiations between the social democrats and the conservatives .

the landslide win for conservatives in bavaria ’ s local elections leaves the ruling social democrat party reeling – and calling for changes . with a final result of 60.7 percent of the votes , bavaria ’ s christian social union won its first-ever two-thirds majority in a state parliament .
the result marked the csu ’ s strongest showing since world war ii . the broad win boosts bavaria ’ s state premier edmund stoiber ’ s standing as a potential challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in the next federal election . a win for the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national christian democratic union , was certain from the get-go , but the overwhelming numbers were a blow to the spd .
it made its weakest post-war showing to date , garnering just 19.7 percent of the vote in germany ’ s second-largest state .
the green party edged higher , to 7.7 percent of the vote .
none of the other parties got enough votes to win parliamentary seats . criticism , and calls from within the spd for policy changes , followed on the heels of the stinging defeat as schröder himself accepted responsibility for the result .
yet he vowed to continue on his present course for reform . ' historic dismantling ' of spd the chairman of the spd in the state of saarland , heiko maas , told the berliner zeitung the low numbers represent the further “ historic dismantling of the spd ” that had already begun with devastating losses in the states of hesse and lower saxony in february . he blamed the federal government ’ s reform policies for the defeat , noting that the reforms are alienating typical spd voters .
“ that includes the contents of the policies , but also the way in which they are communicated . something there is going wrong , ” he said . indeed , voter turnout for the bavaria election was reported at an all-time low of 57 percent . “ i ’ ve thought several times that -lrb- the spd -rrb- had hit bottom . but you can always be negatively surprised , ” maas said . more than a local result germany ’ s minister for family affairs , renate schmidt , also pinned the loss on national , rather than local , issues . “ it isn ’ t necessarily a bavarian result ” said schmidt .
rather , the result reflects germans ’ uneasiness with schröder ’ s announced agenda 2010 package of health , welfare and pension reforms . “ people understand theoretically that we need to initiate reforms .
and theoretically they understand the need for spending cuts .
but they don ’ t want to admit that these cuts should apply to them . ” schröder : ' bitter defeat ' schröder also accepted the blame for the result , calling it a “ bitter defeat for the spd . ”
however , he said he will stick to his planned reform course despite the internal criticisms . germany is “ in the middle off a difficult reform phase ” which stands to affect a lot of people , and “ people are afraid of changes , ” schröder said .
but economic growth and jobs can only be created through implementation of the agenda 2010 reforms , he said . blessing in disguise ? indeed , despite internal disappointment , sunday ’ s vote may well open the way for schröder to steer the stalled reform package through parliament this autumn .
the conservative opposition can block most of the measures through their control of the upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat . talks were at a standstill in the run-up to the election , as stoiber tried to avoid taking a stance on potentially unpopular cuts - many of which his party avidly supports . with the election behind them , however , the road is now open for negotiations between the social democrats and the conservatives . " this election sends signals across the nation , " stoiber said .
" we will use our majority in the upper house constructively , but we expect the chancellor to move towards us to find solutions to the problems facing the country .

the landslide win for conservatives in bavaria ’ s local elections leaves the ruling social democrat party reeling – and calling for changes . with a final result of 60.7 percent of the votes , bavaria ’ s christian social union won its first-ever two-thirds majority in a state parliament .
the result marked the csu ’ s strongest showing since world war ii . the broad win boosts bavaria ’ s state premier edmund stoiber ’ s standing as a potential challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in the next federal election . a win for the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national christian democratic union , was certain from the get-go , but the overwhelming numbers were a blow to the spd .
it made its weakest post-war showing to date , garnering just 19.7 percent of the vote in germany ’ s second-largest state .
the green party edged higher , to 7.7 percent of the vote .
none of the other parties got enough votes to win parliamentary seats . criticism , and calls from within the spd for policy changes , followed on the heels of the stinging defeat as schröder himself accepted responsibility for the result .
yet he vowed to continue on his present course for reform . ' historic dismantling ' of spd the chairman of the spd in the state of saarland , heiko maas , told the berliner zeitung the low numbers represent the further “ historic dismantling of the spd ” that had already begun with devastating losses in the states of hesse and lower saxony in february . he blamed the federal government ’ s reform policies for the defeat , noting that the reforms are alienating typical spd voters .
“ that includes the contents of the policies , but also the way in which they are communicated . something there is going wrong , ” he said . indeed , voter turnout for the bavaria election was reported at an all-time low of 57 percent . “ i ’ ve thought several times that -lrb- the spd -rrb- had hit bottom . but you can always be negatively surprised , ” maas said . more than a local result germany ’ s minister for family affairs , renate schmidt , also pinned the loss on national , rather than local , issues . “ it isn ’ t necessarily a bavarian result ” said schmidt .
rather , the result reflects germans ’ uneasiness with schröder ’ s announced agenda 2010 package of health , welfare and pension reforms . “ people understand theoretically that we need to initiate reforms .
and theoretically they understand the need for spending cuts .
but they don ’ t want to admit that these cuts should apply to them . ” schröder : ' bitter defeat ' schröder also accepted the blame for the result , calling it a “ bitter defeat for the spd . ”
however , he said he will stick to his planned reform course despite the internal criticisms . germany is “ in the middle off a difficult reform phase ” which stands to affect a lot of people , and “ people are afraid of changes , ” schröder said .
but economic growth and jobs can only be created through implementation of the agenda 2010 reforms , he said . blessing in disguise ? indeed , despite internal disappointment , sunday ’ s vote may well open the way for schröder to steer the stalled reform package through parliament this autumn .
the conservative opposition can block most of the measures through their control of the upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat . talks were at a standstill in the run-up to the election , as stoiber tried to avoid taking a stance on potentially unpopular cuts - many of which his party avidly supports . with the election behind them , however , the road is now open for negotiations between the social democrats and the conservatives . " this election sends signals across the nation , " stoiber said .

the result marked the csu ’ s strongest showing since world war ii . the broad win boosts bavaria ’ s state premier edmund stoiber ’ s standing as a potential challenger to chancellor gerhard schröder in the next federal election . a win for the csu , the bavarian sister party of the national christian democratic union , was certain from the get-go , but the overwhelming numbers were a blow to the spd .

' historic dismantling ' of spd the chairman of the spd in the state of saarland , heiko maas , told the berliner zeitung the low numbers represent the further “ historic dismantling of the spd ” that had already begun with devastating losses in the states of hesse and lower saxony in february . he blamed the federal government ’ s reform policies for the defeat , noting that the reforms are alienating typical spd voters .

but they don ’ t want to admit that these cuts should apply to them . ” schröder : ' bitter defeat ' schröder also accepted the blame for the result , calling it a “ bitter defeat for the spd . ”
however , he said he will stick to his planned reform course despite the internal criticisms . germany is “ in the middle off a difficult reform phase ” which stands to affect a lot of people , and “ people are afraid of changes , ” schröder said .

sadakazu tanigaki , previously minister for public security , takes over from the 81-year-old masajuro shiokawa , who is stepping down because of illness .
combined with the reappointment of heizo takenaka , the minister for economic policy and financial services and one of japan 's most prominent liberals , the move is seen as an attempt to accelerate economic reform .
mr koizumi 's government needs to create jobs , bolster battered banks and regain the trust of the international investment community .
key appointments sadakazu tanigaki , 58 : newly appointed finance minister heizo takenaka , 52 : reappointed as minister for economic and fiscal policy yoriko kawaguchi , 62 : retained as foreign minister shoichi nakagawa , 50 : newly appointed trade minister taro aso , 63 : newly appointed minister for public mananagement and home affairs mr koizumi was re-elected as leader of the ruling ldp at the weekend , a victory that triggered the reshuffle .
he is now likely to call a general election , as early as november .
but financial markets , which have long been sceptical of the political will to tackle tricky reforms , were unimpressed by the reshuffle , which left almost all other cabinet members unchanged .
" overall it 's more of the same , which is not particularly good because it implies inaction , " said richard jerram of ing securities .
the nikkei share index was down 3.9 % after the reshuffle announcement , but the fall reflected events over the weekend and concerns over japan 's exchange rate , analysts said .
pros and cons under japan 's current cabinet structure , mr takenaka has more economic influence than the finance minister , who is largely restricted to policing the currency , the yen .
mr takenaka was brought in in 2001 to co-ordinate economic reform , and his breezy , vigorous style was initially seen as a welcome change from the traditionally cautious pace of japanese politics .
the nikkei share index closes down 4.2 % , despite cautious optimism over the reshuffle why a soaring yen has battered japanese shares there had been persistent rumours that mr takenaka was to be relieved of one of his two ministerial portfolios in the reshuffle , owing to dissatisfaction at his abrupt methods .
but there are wider concerns that mr takenaka has achieved little , and that the focus of his reforms - on structural elements such as the health of the banking sector - is misplaced .
many economists now argue that japan could kick-start growth more efficiently by making the yen cheaper and boosting exports - something within the province of the finance ministry .
mr tanigaki said he would not change the country 's foreign exchange policy , adding only that currencies should be stable and reflect economic fundamentals .
political boost the reshuffle comes at a time when the japanese economy seems to recovering almost of its own accord .
growth is exceeding even government forecasts , powered by an unexpected surge in exports , and there are even signs that unemployment may be starting to ease .
any economic bounce will be good news for mr koizumi , who has faced mounting opposition - not least from within his liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- .
some in the ldp 's old guard - to which the outgoing finance minister belonged - had demanded mr takenaka 's replacement .

mr takenaka was brought in in 2001 to co-ordinate economic reform , and his breezy , vigorous style was initially seen as a welcome change from the traditionally cautious pace of japanese politics .
the nikkei share index closes down 4.2 % , despite cautious optimism over the reshuffle why a soaring yen has battered japanese shares there had been persistent rumours that mr takenaka was to be relieved of one of his two ministerial portfolios in the reshuffle , owing to dissatisfaction at his abrupt methods .
but there are wider concerns that mr takenaka has achieved little , and that the focus of his reforms - on structural elements such as the health of the banking sector - is misplaced .
many economists now argue that japan could kick-start growth more efficiently by making the yen cheaper and boosting exports - something within the province of the finance ministry .
mr tanigaki said he would not change the country 's foreign exchange policy , adding only that currencies should be stable and reflect economic fundamentals .
political boost the reshuffle comes at a time when the japanese economy seems to recovering almost of its own accord .
growth is exceeding even government forecasts , powered by an unexpected surge in exports , and there are even signs that unemployment may be starting to ease .
any economic bounce will be good news for mr koizumi , who has faced mounting opposition - not least from within his liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- .
some in the ldp 's old guard - to which the outgoing finance minister belonged - had demanded mr takenaka 's replacement .

sadakazu tanigaki , previously minister for public security , takes over from the 81-year-old masajuro shiokawa , who is stepping down because of illness .
combined with the reappointment of heizo takenaka , the minister for economic policy and financial services and one of japan 's most prominent liberals , the move is seen as an attempt to accelerate economic reform .

in a statement , the cwu said : " the national ballot is disappointing news for the union but royal mail can not view a less than 1 % majority as a mandate for massive job losses across the industry . "
a cwu spokesman added : " we still have to get a negotiated settlement , all that 's changed is that the union 's position is considerably less strong that it was before . "
keeping post moving union officials blamed pressure from management for the outcome , but said postal workers would continue to fight for a better wage .
the dispute is over pay and conditions , with postal staff rejecting a pay raise valued by management at 14.5 % over 18 months , because they say it is tied to changes which would mean the loss of thousands of jobs .
