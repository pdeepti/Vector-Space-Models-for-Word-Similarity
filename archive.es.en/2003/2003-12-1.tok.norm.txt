program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2003 kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan focuses on emissions and the environment .
experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .
then we control such extremes to an extent , " trittin said .
" but it ’ s a very challenging goal , " the minister admitted . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.12.2003 german companies join south africa 's battle with aids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is a major epidemic in south africa as the aids epidemic in south africa continues to rage , german companies with bases there have developed programs to promote prevention and improve treatment for their employees . latest statistics suggest that aids will have wiped out 20 percent of the world ’ s population by the year 2050 , with some four million people falling victim to the killer disease in south africa alone .
aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .
bmw south africa is one of the companies which has recognized the importance of helping its employees to help and protect themselves . containing the epidemic in a bid to prevent the disease reaching epidemic proportions within the confines of the company , bmw south africa developed a far-reaching program which offers advice , counseling and voluntary aids tests to the company ’ s employees .
communications manager for bmw south africa , richard carter , is pleased with the results . “ we are satisfied that our infection rate is less than the norm , and we believe the program from the last three or four years of getting people to know their status has really helped to keep the infection rate down , which is very gratifying for us , and very good for our work force , ” carter told deutsche welle . of the almost 3,000 bmw employees , some 85 percent have already volunteered to be tested .
and of those , some 6.5 percent have proved to be infected with the hiv virus , which is significantly lower than the standard 20 percent infection rate in the south african workforce .
but actually convincing people to take the test in the first place required bmw to create an atmosphere of trust . “ people are a little worried about going for the test , particularly if they think they might be positive .
they don ’ t want to hear the bad news .
but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .
richard carter explains that it is not enough to have a program operating at the bmw plant .
“ these people go home ; our people have families , schools , churches .
we feel it is very very important to get out into the communities and to spread this language and this message , ” carter said . a growing trend bmw is not the only german company in south africa engaged in a program to promote aids awareness and prevention .
some 79 percent of daimlerchrysler ’ s 5,000-strong south african workforce have been tested .
for the 9 percent with hiv , daimlerchrysler offers free medication to help keep the disease under control .
the strategy , which was created between germany ’ s gtz charity for technical cooperation and daimlerchrysler , has proved successful in protecting both the company 's profit and productivity . electronics giant siemens is cutting a similar path in south africa . the company has set up a 24-hour telephone line for help and advice on aids-related problems , and has installed condom machines throughout the plant .
siemens has also appointed 20 voluntary counselors who are on site to answer questions and offer support . overall the business world has been slow to react to hiv and aids , but bmw , daimlerchrysler and siemens are setting a example others might well follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .
bmw south africa is one of the companies which has recognized the importance of helping its employees to help and protect themselves . containing the epidemic in a bid to prevent the disease reaching epidemic proportions within the confines of the company , bmw south africa developed a far-reaching program which offers advice , counseling and voluntary aids tests to the company ’ s employees .
communications manager for bmw south africa , richard carter , is pleased with the results . “ we are satisfied that our infection rate is less than the norm , and we believe the program from the last three or four years of getting people to know their status has really helped to keep the infection rate down , which is very gratifying for us , and very good for our work force , ” carter told deutsche welle . of the almost 3,000 bmw employees , some 85 percent have already volunteered to be tested .
and of those , some 6.5 percent have proved to be infected with the hiv virus , which is significantly lower than the standard 20 percent infection rate in the south african workforce .
but actually convincing people to take the test in the first place required bmw to create an atmosphere of trust . “ people are a little worried about going for the test , particularly if they think they might be positive .
they don ’ t want to hear the bad news .
but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .
richard carter explains that it is not enough to have a program operating at the bmw plant .
“ these people go home ; our people have families , schools , churches .
we feel it is very very important to get out into the communities and to spread this language and this message , ” carter said . a growing trend bmw is not the only german company in south africa engaged in a program to promote aids awareness and prevention .
some 79 percent of daimlerchrysler ’ s 5,000-strong south african workforce have been tested .
for the 9 percent with hiv , daimlerchrysler offers free medication to help keep the disease under control .
the strategy , which was created between germany ’ s gtz charity for technical cooperation and daimlerchrysler , has proved successful in protecting both the company 's profit and productivity . electronics giant siemens is cutting a similar path in south africa . the company has set up a 24-hour telephone line for help and advice on aids-related problems , and has installed condom machines throughout the plant .
siemens has also appointed 20 voluntary counselors who are on site to answer questions and offer support . overall the business world has been slow to react to hiv and aids , but bmw , daimlerchrysler and siemens are setting a example others might well follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2003 kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan focuses on emissions and the environment .
experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .
then we control such extremes to an extent , " trittin said .

experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .

but a new kind of market lets visitors experience the holiday as it was celebrated hundreds of years ago . more and more , germany 's countless christmas markets are coming to resemble temporary , winter-themed shopping malls .
stand after stand offers ornaments , children 's toys , candles , clothes , and various other seasonal knick-knacks .
a key aspect of the weinachtsmarkt experience is drinking spiced mulled glühwein and eating wurst and french fries while tinny christmas carols pipe out of loudspeakers .
in recent years , though , some christmas market organizers have begun offering an alternative .
sometimes called " medieval " and sometimes " historic , " these themed christmas markets aim to recreate feudal market life in the middle ages .
visitors enter a world as it existed before electricity , when the languages spoken were middle-high german and latin .
most often , the events are held in evocative , authentic-looking locations , such as the grounds of a castle or in an historic town square .
living history one of the most impressive of these is held at burg satzvey , a 12th century moated castle in the eifel region , not far from cologne .
the castle regularly hosts medieval jousting tournaments and renaissance fairs , and , since the mid-1990s , a market with a living nativity -lrb- spoken in latin and involving a large herd of sheep -rrb- , over each of the four weekends leading up to christmas .
entering the market at satzvey is a lot like going into a living history museum .
the first thing you notice is the lack of electricity – no gaudy strings of bulbs , no fairground rides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burg satzvey at night .
instead , the castle and booths are lit by flaming torches , and people stand sipping warm drinks -lrb- glühwein did n't exist yet – how about a nice flagon of mead ? -rrb- around small open fires .
you can forget about getting french fries for the kids , though they may enjoy chunks of roasted meat on pita-like bread from a wood oven .
the only music to be heard is live : small groups of minstrels and musicians stroll about , playing ancient instruments -lrb- think sackbut and dulcimer -rrb- .
instead of fairground rides , live performers do tumbling , fire eating and juggling acts among the crowds .
talking the talk the entertainers and stall vendors alike are dressed in medieval garb , and will often pepper their german with either latin or middle-high german – demanding payment in long-extinct taler or silberlinge instead of euros -lrb- which are , nonetheless , the true coin of the realm . -rrb-
the wares that they are selling , too , differ from the traditional weinachtsmarkt fare of glittering ornaments and carved nutcrackers .
everything for sale must be hand crafted and historically appropriate , with wooden toys , baskets , musical instruments , period clothing and handmade jewelry especially heavily represented .
-lrb- if you want to buy a celtic drinking horn or a starter crossbow set for your child , you could do worse than to visit a medieval christmas market . -rrb-
no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .
the winter solstice is celebrated in a series of fire-lit short plays and ceremonies .
the market stands are decorated with natural materials , such as pine cones , acorns and chestnuts .
medieval christmas markets are found all over germany – nearly thirty were recently listed in ludwig fischer ’ s pax-et-gaudium .
for his part , fischer recommends the following five as being particularly worth a visit .
they are : 1 -rrb- dresden .
historical christmas market among the arched arcades of dresden ’ s famous stallhof building .
2 -rrb- esslingen . -lrb- near stuttgart -rrb- the medieval market starts at the beautiful baroque rathaus square , continuing under the half-timbered facades on the market square and through the narrow alleyways of the old town .
3 -rrb- burg satzvey -lrb- mechernich , near cologne / bonn -rrb- on four weekends leading up to christmas , historic christmas market and nativity scene with live animals .
4 -rrb- siegburg .
on the main market square , germany ’ s first medieval christmas market , and one of the most genuine .
with 45 stands .
5 -rrb- cologne .
at the historic chocolate museum , on the banks of the rhine .

no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .
the winter solstice is celebrated in a series of fire-lit short plays and ceremonies .
the market stands are decorated with natural materials , such as pine cones , acorns and chestnuts .
medieval christmas markets are found all over germany – nearly thirty were recently listed in ludwig fischer ’ s pax-et-gaudium .
for his part , fischer recommends the following five as being particularly worth a visit .
they are : 1 -rrb- dresden .
historical christmas market among the arched arcades of dresden ’ s famous stallhof building .

no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .

but a new kind of market lets visitors experience the holiday as it was celebrated hundreds of years ago . more and more , germany 's countless christmas markets are coming to resemble temporary , winter-themed shopping malls .
stand after stand offers ornaments , children 's toys , candles , clothes , and various other seasonal knick-knacks .
a key aspect of the weinachtsmarkt experience is drinking spiced mulled glühwein and eating wurst and french fries while tinny christmas carols pipe out of loudspeakers .
in recent years , though , some christmas market organizers have begun offering an alternative .
sometimes called " medieval " and sometimes " historic , " these themed christmas markets aim to recreate feudal market life in the middle ages .
visitors enter a world as it existed before electricity , when the languages spoken were middle-high german and latin .
most often , the events are held in evocative , authentic-looking locations , such as the grounds of a castle or in an historic town square .
living history one of the most impressive of these is held at burg satzvey , a 12th century moated castle in the eifel region , not far from cologne .
the castle regularly hosts medieval jousting tournaments and renaissance fairs , and , since the mid-1990s , a market with a living nativity -lrb- spoken in latin and involving a large herd of sheep -rrb- , over each of the four weekends leading up to christmas .
entering the market at satzvey is a lot like going into a living history museum .
the first thing you notice is the lack of electricity – no gaudy strings of bulbs , no fairground rides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burg satzvey at night .
instead , the castle and booths are lit by flaming torches , and people stand sipping warm drinks -lrb- glühwein did n't exist yet – how about a nice flagon of mead ? -rrb- around small open fires .
you can forget about getting french fries for the kids , though they may enjoy chunks of roasted meat on pita-like bread from a wood oven .
the only music to be heard is live : small groups of minstrels and musicians stroll about , playing ancient instruments -lrb- think sackbut and dulcimer -rrb- .
instead of fairground rides , live performers do tumbling , fire eating and juggling acts among the crowds .
talking the talk the entertainers and stall vendors alike are dressed in medieval garb , and will often pepper their german with either latin or middle-high german – demanding payment in long-extinct taler or silberlinge instead of euros -lrb- which are , nonetheless , the true coin of the realm . -rrb-
the wares that they are selling , too , differ from the traditional weinachtsmarkt fare of glittering ornaments and carved nutcrackers .
everything for sale must be hand crafted and historically appropriate , with wooden toys , baskets , musical instruments , period clothing and handmade jewelry especially heavily represented .
-lrb- if you want to buy a celtic drinking horn or a starter crossbow set for your child , you could do worse than to visit a medieval christmas market . -rrb-
no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .
the winter solstice is celebrated in a series of fire-lit short plays and ceremonies .
the market stands are decorated with natural materials , such as pine cones , acorns and chestnuts .
medieval christmas markets are found all over germany – nearly thirty were recently listed in ludwig fischer ’ s pax-et-gaudium .
for his part , fischer recommends the following five as being particularly worth a visit .
they are : 1 -rrb- dresden .
historical christmas market among the arched arcades of dresden ’ s famous stallhof building .
2 -rrb- esslingen . -lrb- near stuttgart -rrb- the medieval market starts at the beautiful baroque rathaus square , continuing under the half-timbered facades on the market square and through the narrow alleyways of the old town .
3 -rrb- burg satzvey -lrb- mechernich , near cologne / bonn -rrb- on four weekends leading up to christmas , historic christmas market and nativity scene with live animals .
4 -rrb- siegburg .
on the main market square , germany ’ s first medieval christmas market , and one of the most genuine .
with 45 stands .
5 -rrb- cologne .
at the historic chocolate museum , on the banks of the rhine .

aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .
bmw south africa is one of the companies which has recognized the importance of helping its employees to help and protect themselves . containing the epidemic in a bid to prevent the disease reaching epidemic proportions within the confines of the company , bmw south africa developed a far-reaching program which offers advice , counseling and voluntary aids tests to the company ’ s employees .
communications manager for bmw south africa , richard carter , is pleased with the results . “ we are satisfied that our infection rate is less than the norm , and we believe the program from the last three or four years of getting people to know their status has really helped to keep the infection rate down , which is very gratifying for us , and very good for our work force , ” carter told deutsche welle . of the almost 3,000 bmw employees , some 85 percent have already volunteered to be tested .
and of those , some 6.5 percent have proved to be infected with the hiv virus , which is significantly lower than the standard 20 percent infection rate in the south african workforce .
but actually convincing people to take the test in the first place required bmw to create an atmosphere of trust . “ people are a little worried about going for the test , particularly if they think they might be positive .
they don ’ t want to hear the bad news .
but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .
richard carter explains that it is not enough to have a program operating at the bmw plant .
“ these people go home ; our people have families , schools , churches .
we feel it is very very important to get out into the communities and to spread this language and this message , ” carter said . a growing trend bmw is not the only german company in south africa engaged in a program to promote aids awareness and prevention .
some 79 percent of daimlerchrysler ’ s 5,000-strong south african workforce have been tested .
for the 9 percent with hiv , daimlerchrysler offers free medication to help keep the disease under control .
the strategy , which was created between germany ’ s gtz charity for technical cooperation and daimlerchrysler , has proved successful in protecting both the company 's profit and productivity . electronics giant siemens is cutting a similar path in south africa . the company has set up a 24-hour telephone line for help and advice on aids-related problems , and has installed condom machines throughout the plant .
siemens has also appointed 20 voluntary counselors who are on site to answer questions and offer support . overall the business world has been slow to react to hiv and aids , but bmw , daimlerchrysler and siemens are setting a example others might well follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .
bmw south africa is one of the companies which has recognized the importance of helping its employees to help and protect themselves . containing the epidemic in a bid to prevent the disease reaching epidemic proportions within the confines of the company , bmw south africa developed a far-reaching program which offers advice , counseling and voluntary aids tests to the company ’ s employees .
communications manager for bmw south africa , richard carter , is pleased with the results . “ we are satisfied that our infection rate is less than the norm , and we believe the program from the last three or four years of getting people to know their status has really helped to keep the infection rate down , which is very gratifying for us , and very good for our work force , ” carter told deutsche welle . of the almost 3,000 bmw employees , some 85 percent have already volunteered to be tested .
and of those , some 6.5 percent have proved to be infected with the hiv virus , which is significantly lower than the standard 20 percent infection rate in the south african workforce .
but actually convincing people to take the test in the first place required bmw to create an atmosphere of trust . “ people are a little worried about going for the test , particularly if they think they might be positive .
they don ’ t want to hear the bad news .
but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2003 kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan focuses on emissions and the environment .
experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .

the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .

experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .

the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .
then we control such extremes to an extent , " trittin said .
" but it ’ s a very challenging goal , " the minister admitted . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.12.2003 german companies join south africa 's battle with aids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is a major epidemic in south africa as the aids epidemic in south africa continues to rage , german companies with bases there have developed programs to promote prevention and improve treatment for their employees . latest statistics suggest that aids will have wiped out 20 percent of the world ’ s population by the year 2050 , with some four million people falling victim to the killer disease in south africa alone .
aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .
bmw south africa is one of the companies which has recognized the importance of helping its employees to help and protect themselves . containing the epidemic in a bid to prevent the disease reaching epidemic proportions within the confines of the company , bmw south africa developed a far-reaching program which offers advice , counseling and voluntary aids tests to the company ’ s employees .
communications manager for bmw south africa , richard carter , is pleased with the results . “ we are satisfied that our infection rate is less than the norm , and we believe the program from the last three or four years of getting people to know their status has really helped to keep the infection rate down , which is very gratifying for us , and very good for our work force , ” carter told deutsche welle . of the almost 3,000 bmw employees , some 85 percent have already volunteered to be tested .
and of those , some 6.5 percent have proved to be infected with the hiv virus , which is significantly lower than the standard 20 percent infection rate in the south african workforce .
but actually convincing people to take the test in the first place required bmw to create an atmosphere of trust . “ people are a little worried about going for the test , particularly if they think they might be positive .
they don ’ t want to hear the bad news .
but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .
richard carter explains that it is not enough to have a program operating at the bmw plant .
“ these people go home ; our people have families , schools , churches .
we feel it is very very important to get out into the communities and to spread this language and this message , ” carter said . a growing trend bmw is not the only german company in south africa engaged in a program to promote aids awareness and prevention .
some 79 percent of daimlerchrysler ’ s 5,000-strong south african workforce have been tested .
for the 9 percent with hiv , daimlerchrysler offers free medication to help keep the disease under control .
the strategy , which was created between germany ’ s gtz charity for technical cooperation and daimlerchrysler , has proved successful in protecting both the company 's profit and productivity . electronics giant siemens is cutting a similar path in south africa . the company has set up a 24-hour telephone line for help and advice on aids-related problems , and has installed condom machines throughout the plant .
siemens has also appointed 20 voluntary counselors who are on site to answer questions and offer support . overall the business world has been slow to react to hiv and aids , but bmw , daimlerchrysler and siemens are setting a example others might well follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .
bmw south africa is one of the companies which has recognized the importance of helping its employees to help and protect themselves . containing the epidemic in a bid to prevent the disease reaching epidemic proportions within the confines of the company , bmw south africa developed a far-reaching program which offers advice , counseling and voluntary aids tests to the company ’ s employees .
communications manager for bmw south africa , richard carter , is pleased with the results . “ we are satisfied that our infection rate is less than the norm , and we believe the program from the last three or four years of getting people to know their status has really helped to keep the infection rate down , which is very gratifying for us , and very good for our work force , ” carter told deutsche welle . of the almost 3,000 bmw employees , some 85 percent have already volunteered to be tested .
and of those , some 6.5 percent have proved to be infected with the hiv virus , which is significantly lower than the standard 20 percent infection rate in the south african workforce .
but actually convincing people to take the test in the first place required bmw to create an atmosphere of trust . “ people are a little worried about going for the test , particularly if they think they might be positive .
they don ’ t want to hear the bad news .
but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .
richard carter explains that it is not enough to have a program operating at the bmw plant .
“ these people go home ; our people have families , schools , churches .
we feel it is very very important to get out into the communities and to spread this language and this message , ” carter said . a growing trend bmw is not the only german company in south africa engaged in a program to promote aids awareness and prevention .
some 79 percent of daimlerchrysler ’ s 5,000-strong south african workforce have been tested .
for the 9 percent with hiv , daimlerchrysler offers free medication to help keep the disease under control .
the strategy , which was created between germany ’ s gtz charity for technical cooperation and daimlerchrysler , has proved successful in protecting both the company 's profit and productivity . electronics giant siemens is cutting a similar path in south africa . the company has set up a 24-hour telephone line for help and advice on aids-related problems , and has installed condom machines throughout the plant .

but a new kind of market lets visitors experience the holiday as it was celebrated hundreds of years ago . more and more , germany 's countless christmas markets are coming to resemble temporary , winter-themed shopping malls .
stand after stand offers ornaments , children 's toys , candles , clothes , and various other seasonal knick-knacks .
a key aspect of the weinachtsmarkt experience is drinking spiced mulled glühwein and eating wurst and french fries while tinny christmas carols pipe out of loudspeakers .
in recent years , though , some christmas market organizers have begun offering an alternative .
sometimes called " medieval " and sometimes " historic , " these themed christmas markets aim to recreate feudal market life in the middle ages .
visitors enter a world as it existed before electricity , when the languages spoken were middle-high german and latin .
most often , the events are held in evocative , authentic-looking locations , such as the grounds of a castle or in an historic town square .
living history one of the most impressive of these is held at burg satzvey , a 12th century moated castle in the eifel region , not far from cologne .
the castle regularly hosts medieval jousting tournaments and renaissance fairs , and , since the mid-1990s , a market with a living nativity -lrb- spoken in latin and involving a large herd of sheep -rrb- , over each of the four weekends leading up to christmas .
entering the market at satzvey is a lot like going into a living history museum .
the first thing you notice is the lack of electricity – no gaudy strings of bulbs , no fairground rides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burg satzvey at night .
instead , the castle and booths are lit by flaming torches , and people stand sipping warm drinks -lrb- glühwein did n't exist yet – how about a nice flagon of mead ? -rrb- around small open fires .
you can forget about getting french fries for the kids , though they may enjoy chunks of roasted meat on pita-like bread from a wood oven .
the only music to be heard is live : small groups of minstrels and musicians stroll about , playing ancient instruments -lrb- think sackbut and dulcimer -rrb- .
instead of fairground rides , live performers do tumbling , fire eating and juggling acts among the crowds .
talking the talk the entertainers and stall vendors alike are dressed in medieval garb , and will often pepper their german with either latin or middle-high german – demanding payment in long-extinct taler or silberlinge instead of euros -lrb- which are , nonetheless , the true coin of the realm . -rrb-
the wares that they are selling , too , differ from the traditional weinachtsmarkt fare of glittering ornaments and carved nutcrackers .
everything for sale must be hand crafted and historically appropriate , with wooden toys , baskets , musical instruments , period clothing and handmade jewelry especially heavily represented .
-lrb- if you want to buy a celtic drinking horn or a starter crossbow set for your child , you could do worse than to visit a medieval christmas market . -rrb-
no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .
the winter solstice is celebrated in a series of fire-lit short plays and ceremonies .
the market stands are decorated with natural materials , such as pine cones , acorns and chestnuts .
medieval christmas markets are found all over germany – nearly thirty were recently listed in ludwig fischer ’ s pax-et-gaudium .
for his part , fischer recommends the following five as being particularly worth a visit .
they are : 1 -rrb- dresden .
historical christmas market among the arched arcades of dresden ’ s famous stallhof building .

no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .
the winter solstice is celebrated in a series of fire-lit short plays and ceremonies .
the market stands are decorated with natural materials , such as pine cones , acorns and chestnuts .
medieval christmas markets are found all over germany – nearly thirty were recently listed in ludwig fischer ’ s pax-et-gaudium .
for his part , fischer recommends the following five as being particularly worth a visit .
they are : 1 -rrb- dresden .
historical christmas market among the arched arcades of dresden ’ s famous stallhof building .
2 -rrb- esslingen . -lrb- near stuttgart -rrb- the medieval market starts at the beautiful baroque rathaus square , continuing under the half-timbered facades on the market square and through the narrow alleyways of the old town .

4 -rrb- siegburg .

"
german business leaders hope to initiate deals worth billions as they accompany chancellor gerhard schröder to china .
the three-day visit begins monday .
human rights , some fear , will not get enough attention . liu di is bound to remember schröder ’ s trip to her country .
along with two others , the 23-year-old student was released from prison prior to the chancellor ’ s arrival .
liu , who became known under her chat-room nickname , “ stainless-steel mouse , ” had been jailed for a year for criticizing the government ’ s restrictions on internet use . representatives from the information center for human rights and democracy in hong kong called the release “ a present for schröder , ” but warned about forgetting other dissidents who remain behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese dissident liu di was released prior to schröder 's visit . human rights low on the agenda althougth the protection of human rights is expressly mentioned in a german-chinese accord expected to be signed on monday , schröder does not plan to discuss human rights with chinese president hu jintao and chinese premier wen jiabao , according to news reports . while the chancellor is slated to focus on business during his talks with hu and wen , both of whom he hasn ’ t met since they ascended to their current positions , german justice minister brigitte zypries will be responsible for plans to extend the german-chinese dialogue on the constitutional state for another two years . the german government views the dialogue as the most effective form for discussing human rights .
however , during this trip , zypries is expected to spend more time focusing on patent protection and procedural law . despite failing to fulfil a central criteria for german development aid by violating human rights , china has been the main recipient of financial help from germany for years . germany ’ s top trading partner in asia the chancellor 's main purpose in touring china is to promote business ties between the two countries , as the list of schröder ’ s travel companions shows : it includes the chief executives of siemens , commerzbank and the travel giant tui . economic relations between germany and china are flourishing .
german exports to china doubled during the first half of 2003 .
while china has replaced japan as germany ’ s most important trade partner in asia , germany has become the biggest european investor there . opening a joint venture between tui and china travel service , the first chinese travel agency that ’ s majority foreign owned , schröder jokingly said he expected every chinese person to visit germany .
“ and the way we germans are , we ’ ll figure out how to deal with the logistics , ” schröder said , referring to china ’ s population of 1.3 billion . venturing into new territory for business after meeting chinese leaders in beijing , schröder plans to explore new territory on his fifth visit to the country since 1999 . he will travel to an automobile exhibition in guanzhou -lrb- canton -rrb- and continue on to chengdu , the capital of sichuan province .
situated in southwestern china and bordering tibet , sichuan has a population of 85 million , roughly the same as germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhu rongji and german chancellor gerhard schröder travel in shanghai 's german-built magnetic levitation train during schröder 's visit last year .
chengdu has become known as the “ gate to the west . ”
german companies want to use the city as a base to venture into new markets in less developed regions of china .
a german consulate , which will open soon here , is expected to help in that respect . germany ’ s business sector could lend a hand in developing the region , similar to the economic boost it created when it supported the building of a modern auto industry in china decades ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

"
german business leaders hope to initiate deals worth billions as they accompany chancellor gerhard schröder to china .
the three-day visit begins monday .
human rights , some fear , will not get enough attention . liu di is bound to remember schröder ’ s trip to her country .
along with two others , the 23-year-old student was released from prison prior to the chancellor ’ s arrival .
liu , who became known under her chat-room nickname , “ stainless-steel mouse , ” had been jailed for a year for criticizing the government ’ s restrictions on internet use . representatives from the information center for human rights and democracy in hong kong called the release “ a present for schröder , ” but warned about forgetting other dissidents who remain behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese dissident liu di was released prior to schröder 's visit . human rights low on the agenda althougth the protection of human rights is expressly mentioned in a german-chinese accord expected to be signed on monday , schröder does not plan to discuss human rights with chinese president hu jintao and chinese premier wen jiabao , according to news reports . while the chancellor is slated to focus on business during his talks with hu and wen , both of whom he hasn ’ t met since they ascended to their current positions , german justice minister brigitte zypries will be responsible for plans to extend the german-chinese dialogue on the constitutional state for another two years . the german government views the dialogue as the most effective form for discussing human rights .
however , during this trip , zypries is expected to spend more time focusing on patent protection and procedural law . despite failing to fulfil a central criteria for german development aid by violating human rights , china has been the main recipient of financial help from germany for years . germany ’ s top trading partner in asia the chancellor 's main purpose in touring china is to promote business ties between the two countries , as the list of schröder ’ s travel companions shows : it includes the chief executives of siemens , commerzbank and the travel giant tui . economic relations between germany and china are flourishing .
german exports to china doubled during the first half of 2003 .
while china has replaced japan as germany ’ s most important trade partner in asia , germany has become the biggest european investor there . opening a joint venture between tui and china travel service , the first chinese travel agency that ’ s majority foreign owned , schröder jokingly said he expected every chinese person to visit germany .
“ and the way we germans are , we ’ ll figure out how to deal with the logistics , ” schröder said , referring to china ’ s population of 1.3 billion . venturing into new territory for business after meeting chinese leaders in beijing , schröder plans to explore new territory on his fifth visit to the country since 1999 . he will travel to an automobile exhibition in guanzhou -lrb- canton -rrb- and continue on to chengdu , the capital of sichuan province .
situated in southwestern china and bordering tibet , sichuan has a population of 85 million , roughly the same as germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhu rongji and german chancellor gerhard schröder travel in shanghai 's german-built magnetic levitation train during schröder 's visit last year .
chengdu has become known as the “ gate to the west . ”
german companies want to use the city as a base to venture into new markets in less developed regions of china .
a german consulate , which will open soon here , is expected to help in that respect . germany ’ s business sector could lend a hand in developing the region , similar to the economic boost it created when it supported the building of a modern auto industry in china decades ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2003 kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan focuses on emissions and the environment .
experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .
then we control such extremes to an extent , " trittin said .
" but it ’ s a very challenging goal , " the minister admitted . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2003 kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan focuses on emissions and the environment .
experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.12.2003 german companies join south africa 's battle with aids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is a major epidemic in south africa as the aids epidemic in south africa continues to rage , german companies with bases there have developed programs to promote prevention and improve treatment for their employees . latest statistics suggest that aids will have wiped out 20 percent of the world ’ s population by the year 2050 , with some four million people falling victim to the killer disease in south africa alone .
aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .
bmw south africa is one of the companies which has recognized the importance of helping its employees to help and protect themselves . containing the epidemic in a bid to prevent the disease reaching epidemic proportions within the confines of the company , bmw south africa developed a far-reaching program which offers advice , counseling and voluntary aids tests to the company ’ s employees .
communications manager for bmw south africa , richard carter , is pleased with the results . “ we are satisfied that our infection rate is less than the norm , and we believe the program from the last three or four years of getting people to know their status has really helped to keep the infection rate down , which is very gratifying for us , and very good for our work force , ” carter told deutsche welle . of the almost 3,000 bmw employees , some 85 percent have already volunteered to be tested .
and of those , some 6.5 percent have proved to be infected with the hiv virus , which is significantly lower than the standard 20 percent infection rate in the south african workforce .
but actually convincing people to take the test in the first place required bmw to create an atmosphere of trust . “ people are a little worried about going for the test , particularly if they think they might be positive .
they don ’ t want to hear the bad news .
but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .
richard carter explains that it is not enough to have a program operating at the bmw plant .
“ these people go home ; our people have families , schools , churches .
we feel it is very very important to get out into the communities and to spread this language and this message , ” carter said . a growing trend bmw is not the only german company in south africa engaged in a program to promote aids awareness and prevention .
some 79 percent of daimlerchrysler ’ s 5,000-strong south african workforce have been tested .
for the 9 percent with hiv , daimlerchrysler offers free medication to help keep the disease under control .
the strategy , which was created between germany ’ s gtz charity for technical cooperation and daimlerchrysler , has proved successful in protecting both the company 's profit and productivity . electronics giant siemens is cutting a similar path in south africa . the company has set up a 24-hour telephone line for help and advice on aids-related problems , and has installed condom machines throughout the plant .
siemens has also appointed 20 voluntary counselors who are on site to answer questions and offer support . overall the business world has been slow to react to hiv and aids , but bmw , daimlerchrysler and siemens are setting a example others might well follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

"
german business leaders hope to initiate deals worth billions as they accompany chancellor gerhard schröder to china .
the three-day visit begins monday .
human rights , some fear , will not get enough attention . liu di is bound to remember schröder ’ s trip to her country .
along with two others , the 23-year-old student was released from prison prior to the chancellor ’ s arrival .
liu , who became known under her chat-room nickname , “ stainless-steel mouse , ” had been jailed for a year for criticizing the government ’ s restrictions on internet use . representatives from the information center for human rights and democracy in hong kong called the release “ a present for schröder , ” but warned about forgetting other dissidents who remain behind bars .

however , during this trip , zypries is expected to spend more time focusing on patent protection and procedural law . despite failing to fulfil a central criteria for german development aid by violating human rights , china has been the main recipient of financial help from germany for years . germany ’ s top trading partner in asia the chancellor 's main purpose in touring china is to promote business ties between the two countries , as the list of schröder ’ s travel companions shows : it includes the chief executives of siemens , commerzbank and the travel giant tui . economic relations between germany and china are flourishing .
german exports to china doubled during the first half of 2003 .
while china has replaced japan as germany ’ s most important trade partner in asia , germany has become the biggest european investor there . opening a joint venture between tui and china travel service , the first chinese travel agency that ’ s majority foreign owned , schröder jokingly said he expected every chinese person to visit germany .
“ and the way we germans are , we ’ ll figure out how to deal with the logistics , ” schröder said , referring to china ’ s population of 1.3 billion . venturing into new territory for business after meeting chinese leaders in beijing , schröder plans to explore new territory on his fifth visit to the country since 1999 . he will travel to an automobile exhibition in guanzhou -lrb- canton -rrb- and continue on to chengdu , the capital of sichuan province .
situated in southwestern china and bordering tibet , sichuan has a population of 85 million , roughly the same as germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhu rongji and german chancellor gerhard schröder travel in shanghai 's german-built magnetic levitation train during schröder 's visit last year .
chengdu has become known as the “ gate to the west . ”
german companies want to use the city as a base to venture into new markets in less developed regions of china .
a german consulate , which will open soon here , is expected to help in that respect . germany ’ s business sector could lend a hand in developing the region , similar to the economic boost it created when it supported the building of a modern auto industry in china decades ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .
richard carter explains that it is not enough to have a program operating at the bmw plant .
“ these people go home ; our people have families , schools , churches .
we feel it is very very important to get out into the communities and to spread this language and this message , ” carter said . a growing trend bmw is not the only german company in south africa engaged in a program to promote aids awareness and prevention .
some 79 percent of daimlerchrysler ’ s 5,000-strong south african workforce have been tested .
for the 9 percent with hiv , daimlerchrysler offers free medication to help keep the disease under control .
the strategy , which was created between germany ’ s gtz charity for technical cooperation and daimlerchrysler , has proved successful in protecting both the company 's profit and productivity . electronics giant siemens is cutting a similar path in south africa . the company has set up a 24-hour telephone line for help and advice on aids-related problems , and has installed condom machines throughout the plant .
siemens has also appointed 20 voluntary counselors who are on site to answer questions and offer support . overall the business world has been slow to react to hiv and aids , but bmw , daimlerchrysler and siemens are setting a example others might well follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

"
german business leaders hope to initiate deals worth billions as they accompany chancellor gerhard schröder to china .
the three-day visit begins monday .
human rights , some fear , will not get enough attention . liu di is bound to remember schröder ’ s trip to her country .
along with two others , the 23-year-old student was released from prison prior to the chancellor ’ s arrival .
liu , who became known under her chat-room nickname , “ stainless-steel mouse , ” had been jailed for a year for criticizing the government ’ s restrictions on internet use . representatives from the information center for human rights and democracy in hong kong called the release “ a present for schröder , ” but warned about forgetting other dissidents who remain behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese dissident liu di was released prior to schröder 's visit . human rights low on the agenda althougth the protection of human rights is expressly mentioned in a german-chinese accord expected to be signed on monday , schröder does not plan to discuss human rights with chinese president hu jintao and chinese premier wen jiabao , according to news reports . while the chancellor is slated to focus on business during his talks with hu and wen , both of whom he hasn ’ t met since they ascended to their current positions , german justice minister brigitte zypries will be responsible for plans to extend the german-chinese dialogue on the constitutional state for another two years . the german government views the dialogue as the most effective form for discussing human rights .
however , during this trip , zypries is expected to spend more time focusing on patent protection and procedural law . despite failing to fulfil a central criteria for german development aid by violating human rights , china has been the main recipient of financial help from germany for years . germany ’ s top trading partner in asia the chancellor 's main purpose in touring china is to promote business ties between the two countries , as the list of schröder ’ s travel companions shows : it includes the chief executives of siemens , commerzbank and the travel giant tui . economic relations between germany and china are flourishing .
german exports to china doubled during the first half of 2003 .
while china has replaced japan as germany ’ s most important trade partner in asia , germany has become the biggest european investor there . opening a joint venture between tui and china travel service , the first chinese travel agency that ’ s majority foreign owned , schröder jokingly said he expected every chinese person to visit germany .
“ and the way we germans are , we ’ ll figure out how to deal with the logistics , ” schröder said , referring to china ’ s population of 1.3 billion . venturing into new territory for business after meeting chinese leaders in beijing , schröder plans to explore new territory on his fifth visit to the country since 1999 . he will travel to an automobile exhibition in guanzhou -lrb- canton -rrb- and continue on to chengdu , the capital of sichuan province .
situated in southwestern china and bordering tibet , sichuan has a population of 85 million , roughly the same as germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhu rongji and german chancellor gerhard schröder travel in shanghai 's german-built magnetic levitation train during schröder 's visit last year .
chengdu has become known as the “ gate to the west . ”
german companies want to use the city as a base to venture into new markets in less developed regions of china .
a german consulate , which will open soon here , is expected to help in that respect . germany ’ s business sector could lend a hand in developing the region , similar to the economic boost it created when it supported the building of a modern auto industry in china decades ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

visitors enter a world as it existed before electricity , when the languages spoken were middle-high german and latin .

no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .
the winter solstice is celebrated in a series of fire-lit short plays and ceremonies .
the market stands are decorated with natural materials , such as pine cones , acorns and chestnuts .
medieval christmas markets are found all over germany – nearly thirty were recently listed in ludwig fischer ’ s pax-et-gaudium .
for his part , fischer recommends the following five as being particularly worth a visit .
they are : 1 -rrb- dresden .
historical christmas market among the arched arcades of dresden ’ s famous stallhof building .

no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .
the winter solstice is celebrated in a series of fire-lit short plays and ceremonies .
the market stands are decorated with natural materials , such as pine cones , acorns and chestnuts .
medieval christmas markets are found all over germany – nearly thirty were recently listed in ludwig fischer ’ s pax-et-gaudium .
for his part , fischer recommends the following five as being particularly worth a visit .
they are : 1 -rrb- dresden .
historical christmas market among the arched arcades of dresden ’ s famous stallhof building .

the castle regularly hosts medieval jousting tournaments and renaissance fairs , and , since the mid-1990s , a market with a living nativity -lrb- spoken in latin and involving a large herd of sheep -rrb- , over each of the four weekends leading up to christmas .
entering the market at satzvey is a lot like going into a living history museum .
the first thing you notice is the lack of electricity – no gaudy strings of bulbs , no fairground rides .

no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .
the winter solstice is celebrated in a series of fire-lit short plays and ceremonies .
the market stands are decorated with natural materials , such as pine cones , acorns and chestnuts .
medieval christmas markets are found all over germany – nearly thirty were recently listed in ludwig fischer ’ s pax-et-gaudium .
for his part , fischer recommends the following five as being particularly worth a visit .
they are : 1 -rrb- dresden .
historical christmas market among the arched arcades of dresden ’ s famous stallhof building .
2 -rrb- esslingen . -lrb- near stuttgart -rrb- the medieval market starts at the beautiful baroque rathaus square , continuing under the half-timbered facades on the market square and through the narrow alleyways of the old town .
3 -rrb- burg satzvey -lrb- mechernich , near cologne / bonn -rrb- on four weekends leading up to christmas , historic christmas market and nativity scene with live animals .
4 -rrb- siegburg .
on the main market square , germany ’ s first medieval christmas market , and one of the most genuine .
with 45 stands .
5 -rrb- cologne .
at the historic chocolate museum , on the banks of the rhine .

or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .
the winter solstice is celebrated in a series of fire-lit short plays and ceremonies .
the market stands are decorated with natural materials , such as pine cones , acorns and chestnuts .
medieval christmas markets are found all over germany – nearly thirty were recently listed in ludwig fischer ’ s pax-et-gaudium .
for his part , fischer recommends the following five as being particularly worth a visit .
they are : 1 -rrb- dresden .
historical christmas market among the arched arcades of dresden ’ s famous stallhof building .

but a new kind of market lets visitors experience the holiday as it was celebrated hundreds of years ago . more and more , germany 's countless christmas markets are coming to resemble temporary , winter-themed shopping malls .
stand after stand offers ornaments , children 's toys , candles , clothes , and various other seasonal knick-knacks .
a key aspect of the weinachtsmarkt experience is drinking spiced mulled glühwein and eating wurst and french fries while tinny christmas carols pipe out of loudspeakers .
in recent years , though , some christmas market organizers have begun offering an alternative .
sometimes called " medieval " and sometimes " historic , " these themed christmas markets aim to recreate feudal market life in the middle ages .
visitors enter a world as it existed before electricity , when the languages spoken were middle-high german and latin .
most often , the events are held in evocative , authentic-looking locations , such as the grounds of a castle or in an historic town square .
living history one of the most impressive of these is held at burg satzvey , a 12th century moated castle in the eifel region , not far from cologne .
the castle regularly hosts medieval jousting tournaments and renaissance fairs , and , since the mid-1990s , a market with a living nativity -lrb- spoken in latin and involving a large herd of sheep -rrb- , over each of the four weekends leading up to christmas .
entering the market at satzvey is a lot like going into a living history museum .
the first thing you notice is the lack of electricity – no gaudy strings of bulbs , no fairground rides .

instead , the castle and booths are lit by flaming torches , and people stand sipping warm drinks -lrb- glühwein did n't exist yet – how about a nice flagon of mead ? -rrb- around small open fires .
you can forget about getting french fries for the kids , though they may enjoy chunks of roasted meat on pita-like bread from a wood oven .
the only music to be heard is live : small groups of minstrels and musicians stroll about , playing ancient instruments -lrb- think sackbut and dulcimer -rrb- .
instead of fairground rides , live performers do tumbling , fire eating and juggling acts among the crowds .
talking the talk the entertainers and stall vendors alike are dressed in medieval garb , and will often pepper their german with either latin or middle-high german – demanding payment in long-extinct taler or silberlinge instead of euros -lrb- which are , nonetheless , the true coin of the realm . -rrb-
the wares that they are selling , too , differ from the traditional weinachtsmarkt fare of glittering ornaments and carved nutcrackers .
everything for sale must be hand crafted and historically appropriate , with wooden toys , baskets , musical instruments , period clothing and handmade jewelry especially heavily represented .
-lrb- if you want to buy a celtic drinking horn or a starter crossbow set for your child , you could do worse than to visit a medieval christmas market . -rrb-
no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .

experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .
then we control such extremes to an extent , " trittin said .
" but it ’ s a very challenging goal , " the minister admitted . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan .

experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "

but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .
then we control such extremes to an extent , " trittin said .
" but it ’ s a very challenging goal , " the minister admitted . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.12.2003 german companies join south africa 's battle with aids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is a major epidemic in south africa as the aids epidemic in south africa continues to rage , german companies with bases there have developed programs to promote prevention and improve treatment for their employees . latest statistics suggest that aids will have wiped out 20 percent of the world ’ s population by the year 2050 , with some four million people falling victim to the killer disease in south africa alone .
aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .
bmw south africa is one of the companies which has recognized the importance of helping its employees to help and protect themselves . containing the epidemic in a bid to prevent the disease reaching epidemic proportions within the confines of the company , bmw south africa developed a far-reaching program which offers advice , counseling and voluntary aids tests to the company ’ s employees .
communications manager for bmw south africa , richard carter , is pleased with the results . “ we are satisfied that our infection rate is less than the norm , and we believe the program from the last three or four years of getting people to know their status has really helped to keep the infection rate down , which is very gratifying for us , and very good for our work force , ” carter told deutsche welle . of the almost 3,000 bmw employees , some 85 percent have already volunteered to be tested .
and of those , some 6.5 percent have proved to be infected with the hiv virus , which is significantly lower than the standard 20 percent infection rate in the south african workforce .
but actually convincing people to take the test in the first place required bmw to create an atmosphere of trust . “ people are a little worried about going for the test , particularly if they think they might be positive .
they don ’ t want to hear the bad news .
but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .
richard carter explains that it is not enough to have a program operating at the bmw plant .
“ these people go home ; our people have families , schools , churches .
we feel it is very very important to get out into the communities and to spread this language and this message , ” carter said . a growing trend bmw is not the only german company in south africa engaged in a program to promote aids awareness and prevention .
some 79 percent of daimlerchrysler ’ s 5,000-strong south african workforce have been tested .
for the 9 percent with hiv , daimlerchrysler offers free medication to help keep the disease under control .
the strategy , which was created between germany ’ s gtz charity for technical cooperation and daimlerchrysler , has proved successful in protecting both the company 's profit and productivity . electronics giant siemens is cutting a similar path in south africa . the company has set up a 24-hour telephone line for help and advice on aids-related problems , and has installed condom machines throughout the plant .
siemens has also appointed 20 voluntary counselors who are on site to answer questions and offer support . overall the business world has been slow to react to hiv and aids , but bmw , daimlerchrysler and siemens are setting a example others might well follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

and of those , some 6.5 percent have proved to be infected with the hiv virus , which is significantly lower than the standard 20 percent infection rate in the south african workforce .
but actually convincing people to take the test in the first place required bmw to create an atmosphere of trust . “ people are a little worried about going for the test , particularly if they think they might be positive .
they don ’ t want to hear the bad news .
but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .
richard carter explains that it is not enough to have a program operating at the bmw plant .
“ these people go home ; our people have families , schools , churches .
we feel it is very very important to get out into the communities and to spread this language and this message , ” carter said . a growing trend bmw is not the only german company in south africa engaged in a program to promote aids awareness and prevention .
some 79 percent of daimlerchrysler ’ s 5,000-strong south african workforce have been tested .
for the 9 percent with hiv , daimlerchrysler offers free medication to help keep the disease under control .
the strategy , which was created between germany ’ s gtz charity for technical cooperation and daimlerchrysler , has proved successful in protecting both the company 's profit and productivity . electronics giant siemens is cutting a similar path in south africa . the company has set up a 24-hour telephone line for help and advice on aids-related problems , and has installed condom machines throughout the plant .
siemens has also appointed 20 voluntary counselors who are on site to answer questions and offer support . overall the business world has been slow to react to hiv and aids , but bmw , daimlerchrysler and siemens are setting a example others might well follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2003 kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan focuses on emissions and the environment .
experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .
then we control such extremes to an extent , " trittin said .
" but it ’ s a very challenging goal , " the minister admitted . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan .

liu , who became known under her chat-room nickname , “ stainless-steel mouse , ” had been jailed for a year for criticizing the government ’ s restrictions on internet use . representatives from the information center for human rights and democracy in hong kong called the release “ a present for schröder , ” but warned about forgetting other dissidents who remain behind bars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese dissident liu di was released prior to schröder 's visit . human rights low on the agenda althougth the protection of human rights is expressly mentioned in a german-chinese accord expected to be signed on monday , schröder does not plan to discuss human rights with chinese president hu jintao and chinese premier wen jiabao , according to news reports . while the chancellor is slated to focus on business during his talks with hu and wen , both of whom he hasn ’ t met since they ascended to their current positions , german justice minister brigitte zypries will be responsible for plans to extend the german-chinese dialogue on the constitutional state for another two years . the german government views the dialogue as the most effective form for discussing human rights .
however , during this trip , zypries is expected to spend more time focusing on patent protection and procedural law . despite failing to fulfil a central criteria for german development aid by violating human rights , china has been the main recipient of financial help from germany for years . germany ’ s top trading partner in asia the chancellor 's main purpose in touring china is to promote business ties between the two countries , as the list of schröder ’ s travel companions shows : it includes the chief executives of siemens , commerzbank and the travel giant tui . economic relations between germany and china are flourishing .
german exports to china doubled during the first half of 2003 .
while china has replaced japan as germany ’ s most important trade partner in asia , germany has become the biggest european investor there . opening a joint venture between tui and china travel service , the first chinese travel agency that ’ s majority foreign owned , schröder jokingly said he expected every chinese person to visit germany .
“ and the way we germans are , we ’ ll figure out how to deal with the logistics , ” schröder said , referring to china ’ s population of 1.3 billion . venturing into new territory for business after meeting chinese leaders in beijing , schröder plans to explore new territory on his fifth visit to the country since 1999 . he will travel to an automobile exhibition in guanzhou -lrb- canton -rrb- and continue on to chengdu , the capital of sichuan province .
situated in southwestern china and bordering tibet , sichuan has a population of 85 million , roughly the same as germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhu rongji and german chancellor gerhard schröder travel in shanghai 's german-built magnetic levitation train during schröder 's visit last year .
chengdu has become known as the “ gate to the west . ”
german companies want to use the city as a base to venture into new markets in less developed regions of china .
a german consulate , which will open soon here , is expected to help in that respect . germany ’ s business sector could lend a hand in developing the region , similar to the economic boost it created when it supported the building of a modern auto industry in china decades ago . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chinese tourists in germany : castles and the autobahn since this february , chinese tourist groups have been allowed to travel to germany .

aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .
bmw south africa is one of the companies which has recognized the importance of helping its employees to help and protect themselves . containing the epidemic in a bid to prevent the disease reaching epidemic proportions within the confines of the company , bmw south africa developed a far-reaching program which offers advice , counseling and voluntary aids tests to the company ’ s employees .
communications manager for bmw south africa , richard carter , is pleased with the results . “ we are satisfied that our infection rate is less than the norm , and we believe the program from the last three or four years of getting people to know their status has really helped to keep the infection rate down , which is very gratifying for us , and very good for our work force , ” carter told deutsche welle . of the almost 3,000 bmw employees , some 85 percent have already volunteered to be tested .
and of those , some 6.5 percent have proved to be infected with the hiv virus , which is significantly lower than the standard 20 percent infection rate in the south african workforce .
but actually convincing people to take the test in the first place required bmw to create an atmosphere of trust . “ people are a little worried about going for the test , particularly if they think they might be positive .
they don ’ t want to hear the bad news .
but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .
richard carter explains that it is not enough to have a program operating at the bmw plant .
“ these people go home ; our people have families , schools , churches .
we feel it is very very important to get out into the communities and to spread this language and this message , ” carter said . a growing trend bmw is not the only german company in south africa engaged in a program to promote aids awareness and prevention .
some 79 percent of daimlerchrysler ’ s 5,000-strong south african workforce have been tested .
for the 9 percent with hiv , daimlerchrysler offers free medication to help keep the disease under control .
the strategy , which was created between germany ’ s gtz charity for technical cooperation and daimlerchrysler , has proved successful in protecting both the company 's profit and productivity . electronics giant siemens is cutting a similar path in south africa . the company has set up a 24-hour telephone line for help and advice on aids-related problems , and has installed condom machines throughout the plant .
siemens has also appointed 20 voluntary counselors who are on site to answer questions and offer support . overall the business world has been slow to react to hiv and aids , but bmw , daimlerchrysler and siemens are setting a example others might well follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2003 kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan focuses on emissions and the environment .
experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .
then we control such extremes to an extent , " trittin said .

experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .
then we control such extremes to an extent , " trittin said .
" but it ’ s a very challenging goal , " the minister admitted . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.12.2003 german companies join south africa 's battle with aids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids is a major epidemic in south africa as the aids epidemic in south africa continues to rage , german companies with bases there have developed programs to promote prevention and improve treatment for their employees . latest statistics suggest that aids will have wiped out 20 percent of the world ’ s population by the year 2050 , with some four million people falling victim to the killer disease in south africa alone .
aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .
bmw south africa is one of the companies which has recognized the importance of helping its employees to help and protect themselves . containing the epidemic in a bid to prevent the disease reaching epidemic proportions within the confines of the company , bmw south africa developed a far-reaching program which offers advice , counseling and voluntary aids tests to the company ’ s employees .
communications manager for bmw south africa , richard carter , is pleased with the results . “ we are satisfied that our infection rate is less than the norm , and we believe the program from the last three or four years of getting people to know their status has really helped to keep the infection rate down , which is very gratifying for us , and very good for our work force , ” carter told deutsche welle . of the almost 3,000 bmw employees , some 85 percent have already volunteered to be tested .
and of those , some 6.5 percent have proved to be infected with the hiv virus , which is significantly lower than the standard 20 percent infection rate in the south african workforce .
but actually convincing people to take the test in the first place required bmw to create an atmosphere of trust . “ people are a little worried about going for the test , particularly if they think they might be positive .
they don ’ t want to hear the bad news .
but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .
richard carter explains that it is not enough to have a program operating at the bmw plant .
“ these people go home ; our people have families , schools , churches .
we feel it is very very important to get out into the communities and to spread this language and this message , ” carter said . a growing trend bmw is not the only german company in south africa engaged in a program to promote aids awareness and prevention .
some 79 percent of daimlerchrysler ’ s 5,000-strong south african workforce have been tested .
for the 9 percent with hiv , daimlerchrysler offers free medication to help keep the disease under control .
the strategy , which was created between germany ’ s gtz charity for technical cooperation and daimlerchrysler , has proved successful in protecting both the company 's profit and productivity . electronics giant siemens is cutting a similar path in south africa . the company has set up a 24-hour telephone line for help and advice on aids-related problems , and has installed condom machines throughout the plant .
siemens has also appointed 20 voluntary counselors who are on site to answer questions and offer support . overall the business world has been slow to react to hiv and aids , but bmw , daimlerchrysler and siemens are setting a example others might well follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2003 kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan focuses on emissions and the environment .
experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .
then we control such extremes to an extent , " trittin said .
" but it ’ s a very challenging goal , " the minister admitted . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2003 kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan focuses on emissions and the environment .
experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .

at a two-day meeting in naples , the foreign ministers of the future 25 member states of the european union discussed contentious points of the draft eu constitution .
a major breakthrough was not reached . the countdown has begun to ratify the draft constitutional treaty at the next eu intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in december .
while several smaller points of contention were resolved at the foreign minister 's conference held last weekend , many open issues still remain .
in fact , the truly difficult decisions still must be made .
chances are only fifty-fifty that the eu will actually ratify a new constitution by the end of this year .
agreeing to disagree noticeably visible at the conference was the solidarity between the uk and poland .
apparently the two are keen to build a counterweight to the franco-german axis at the igc .
in particular , the uk wants to block decisions being made by majority voting in the areas of foreign , justice , and tax policy .
poland , like spain , wants to retain the existing voting rules set out in the nice treaty , although these are unfair to larger states .
germany appeared more humble in its position , refraining from making any new demands and instead focusing on retaining the text of the draft constitution .
the atmosphere at the conference was already tense , being overshadowed by the recent dismantling of the stability and growth pact on the part of the germans and french .
nevertheless , german foreign minister joschka fischer denies any deleterious effects of the stability pact fiasco .
but in naples it was evident that the smaller member states soon would seek retribution , maybe even at the upcoming igc .
to resolve the main problems in the current debate on the constitution , some member states propose postponing a decision on voting rules and how votes of individual member states are weighted .
theoretically , these decisions could be made sometime before 2009 when the constitution is to go into force .
however , member states are already practiced in the art of procrastination .
at the legendary marathon igc in nice three years ago , they agreed in principle to create a constitution , but ultimately made lazy compromises .
now the lack of resolve in nice has turned into a painful stumbling block .
to repeat such a mistake again with the ratification of the constitution would be fatal .
if the issues at debate can not be resolved in december , then it would be better simply to lengthen the entire constitution-drafting process .
in any case , having a good constitution that was debated for a longer period of time is certainly more preferable than having a bad constitution that was throw together just to meet a deadline .
common defense the day was saved when , after earlier debates with nato and the u.s. , the eu member states finally agreed in principle to the fundamentals of a common defense policy .
now member states with the capability can prepare for military missions under the umbrella of the eu .
any deployment decisions must be underpinned by a unanimous vote in the council of ministers .
according to the compromise reached in naples , a military planning unit will be created , but a headquarters will not , which is supposed to allay any concerns from nato .
as usual , it 's a typically complicated european compromise .
and in reality , it will have little effect because in all crises and peace missions nato -lrb- with the u.s. -rrb- is required .
only when nato can not , or will not , take action , will the eu be called on .

at a two-day meeting in naples , the foreign ministers of the future 25 member states of the european union discussed contentious points of the draft eu constitution .
a major breakthrough was not reached . the countdown has begun to ratify the draft constitutional treaty at the next eu intergovernmental conference -lrb- igc -rrb- in december .
while several smaller points of contention were resolved at the foreign minister 's conference held last weekend , many open issues still remain .
in fact , the truly difficult decisions still must be made .
chances are only fifty-fifty that the eu will actually ratify a new constitution by the end of this year .
agreeing to disagree noticeably visible at the conference was the solidarity between the uk and poland .
apparently the two are keen to build a counterweight to the franco-german axis at the igc .
in particular , the uk wants to block decisions being made by majority voting in the areas of foreign , justice , and tax policy .
poland , like spain , wants to retain the existing voting rules set out in the nice treaty , although these are unfair to larger states .
germany appeared more humble in its position , refraining from making any new demands and instead focusing on retaining the text of the draft constitution .
the atmosphere at the conference was already tense , being overshadowed by the recent dismantling of the stability and growth pact on the part of the germans and french .
nevertheless , german foreign minister joschka fischer denies any deleterious effects of the stability pact fiasco .
but in naples it was evident that the smaller member states soon would seek retribution , maybe even at the upcoming igc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2003 kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan focuses on emissions and the environment .
experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .
then we control such extremes to an extent , " trittin said .
" but it ’ s a very challenging goal , " the minister admitted . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.12.2003 kyoto set to dominate milan climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan focuses on emissions and the environment .
experts from 180 countries meeting in milan on monday for a new round of u.n. climate talks will thrash out the finer details of the crucial kyoto protocol amid new evidence that global warming is on the rise . government representatives and environmental experts from 180 countries will meet in milan from december 1-12 for an annual review of u.n. efforts to tackle climate change .
the overarching issue for the 12-day meeting is expected to be the u.n. ’ s groundbreaking 1997 kyoto protocol on global warming , which suffered a serious setback in september after russian president vladimir putin shied away from promises that moscow would ratify the key environmental treaty soon .
moscow the environmental kingmaker the fate of the kyoto protocol , which sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years , now rests in moscow ’ s hands after the united states pulled out in 2001 . washington argued at the time that the kyoto protocol was too expensive and unfairly excluded developing nations .
so far 119 nations including the eu member states , japan , canada , new zealand , brazil , india and china have ratified the treaty .
kyoto needs to be approved by countries accounting for 55 percent of emissions in the developed world to enter into force .
the present signatories make for 44 percent of emissions , thus making russia ’ s 17 percent a crucial contributory factor to meet the set target .
but moscow has said it needs time before it signs on the dotted line as it weighs the financial implications of a complex clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
summit could put pressure on russians experts , however , believe it could be months before the russians come around .
" i think we will have to wait until after duma elections -lsb- dec .
7 -rsb- and then putin ’ s own election next spring , " jennifer morgan , climate policy director at the wwf environmental group told reuters last month after the moscow climate conference took place . others believe that the milan summit , though largely technical in tone , could be used to send a powerful message to the russians .
german environmental expert regine günther from wwf said the " the nations that have ratified kyoto must once again put pressure on russia and tell it that they expect russia to ratify it -lrb- kyoto -rrb- as president putin had announced . "
the nuts and bolts the first week of the milan summit is expected to be dominated by technical questions relating to the kyoto protocol like hammering out rules for how countries can plant forests to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
working groups from various nations will also grapple with details of the treaty such as how industrialized nations can invest in clean technologies in developing regions and offset the resulting emissions reductions against their own targets .
the summit will conclude with ministerial round table discussions on dec 10-12 , where ministers will discuss basic underlying issues such as whether the planned proposals actually work and how environmentally friendly technologies can be better promoted .
green concerns could fuel broader debate but even as the mired kyoto protocol dominates the agenda at the milan summit , it ’ s hoped that the meeting will also provide a chance for a broader discussion on climate change .
increasing evidence of global warming is expected to prompt environmental deal makers to explore new long-term measures to contain climate change .
according to new research by the environment organization wwf an overall rise of global temperatures by 4 degrees celsius before the end of the century would eliminate almost all of the world 's glaciers causing sea levels to rise and wiping out fresh water supplies for billions of people .
many now argue that far more drastic action is needed than kyoto ’ s plan to cut emissions by five percent below 1990 levels by 2012 .
german environmental minister jürgen trittin told dw-radio that the german government would like to work towards concrete goals while it waits for the russians to sign up .
" we must set up a task for ourselves .
for instance one can simply say : we must see to it that the average temperature in this century doesn ’ t increase by more than two degrees .
then we control such extremes to an extent , " trittin said .
" but it ’ s a very challenging goal , " the minister admitted . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan .

aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .
bmw south africa is one of the companies which has recognized the importance of helping its employees to help and protect themselves . containing the epidemic in a bid to prevent the disease reaching epidemic proportions within the confines of the company , bmw south africa developed a far-reaching program which offers advice , counseling and voluntary aids tests to the company ’ s employees .
communications manager for bmw south africa , richard carter , is pleased with the results . “ we are satisfied that our infection rate is less than the norm , and we believe the program from the last three or four years of getting people to know their status has really helped to keep the infection rate down , which is very gratifying for us , and very good for our work force , ” carter told deutsche welle . of the almost 3,000 bmw employees , some 85 percent have already volunteered to be tested .

aids is already leaving its devastating mark on the country , with grandparents left to raise their orphaned grandchildren , a lack of qualified teachers to fill the schools and a general depletion of skilled workers . as companies struggle to adapt to the shortage of qualified workers , individual businesses across the country are increasingly having to deal with higher rates of absence and sickness , as well as low moral and production output .
bmw south africa is one of the companies which has recognized the importance of helping its employees to help and protect themselves . containing the epidemic in a bid to prevent the disease reaching epidemic proportions within the confines of the company , bmw south africa developed a far-reaching program which offers advice , counseling and voluntary aids tests to the company ’ s employees .
communications manager for bmw south africa , richard carter , is pleased with the results . “ we are satisfied that our infection rate is less than the norm , and we believe the program from the last three or four years of getting people to know their status has really helped to keep the infection rate down , which is very gratifying for us , and very good for our work force , ” carter told deutsche welle . of the almost 3,000 bmw employees , some 85 percent have already volunteered to be tested .
and of those , some 6.5 percent have proved to be infected with the hiv virus , which is significantly lower than the standard 20 percent infection rate in the south african workforce .
but actually convincing people to take the test in the first place required bmw to create an atmosphere of trust . “ people are a little worried about going for the test , particularly if they think they might be positive .
they don ’ t want to hear the bad news .
but it isn ’ t a death sentence , you can in fact live with the virus and have it controlled , ” carter explains . startling research in order to develop the program , it was important for bmw to find out what employees ' opinions about aids are .
a study commissioned from the university of pretoria revealed - to bmw 's astonishment - how many false assumptions were still attached to hiv and aids . some believed that the disease could be transmitted by simply exchanging a glance or a kiss with a carrier . the results of the study sparked bmw into offering their employees a year of different educational seminars and courses around the subject of aids .
the company had to convince employees that if they went for a test , their results would remain confidential , that bmw would pay for their treatment , and that they would not lose their jobs . learning from each other a team of experts , including a doctor , nurse and psychologist , worked together to come up with the program .
they created voluntary counselling positions for employees who wanted to help their colleagues learn and understand more about the epidemic .
the strategy has been popular , as it removes some of the fear which many employees experience when faced with having to talk to managers or doctors about the disease . carter is particularly concerned about younger , unmarried employees between the ages of 18 and 26 .
“ these are all very high risk groups and we specifically target them by bringing speakers in who are young people living with aids , who can speak to the youngsters in the company in their own language , not just in english , ” he said . bmw also has plans to open an aids testing centre in a suburb where many of its employees live .
richard carter explains that it is not enough to have a program operating at the bmw plant .
“ these people go home ; our people have families , schools , churches .
we feel it is very very important to get out into the communities and to spread this language and this message , ” carter said . a growing trend bmw is not the only german company in south africa engaged in a program to promote aids awareness and prevention .
some 79 percent of daimlerchrysler ’ s 5,000-strong south african workforce have been tested .
for the 9 percent with hiv , daimlerchrysler offers free medication to help keep the disease under control .
the strategy , which was created between germany ’ s gtz charity for technical cooperation and daimlerchrysler , has proved successful in protecting both the company 's profit and productivity . electronics giant siemens is cutting a similar path in south africa . the company has set up a 24-hour telephone line for help and advice on aids-related problems , and has installed condom machines throughout the plant .
siemens has also appointed 20 voluntary counselors who are on site to answer questions and offer support . overall the business world has been slow to react to hiv and aids , but bmw , daimlerchrysler and siemens are setting a example others might well follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers warn about aids in eastern europe of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .

but a new kind of market lets visitors experience the holiday as it was celebrated hundreds of years ago . more and more , germany 's countless christmas markets are coming to resemble temporary , winter-themed shopping malls .
stand after stand offers ornaments , children 's toys , candles , clothes , and various other seasonal knick-knacks .
a key aspect of the weinachtsmarkt experience is drinking spiced mulled glühwein and eating wurst and french fries while tinny christmas carols pipe out of loudspeakers .
in recent years , though , some christmas market organizers have begun offering an alternative .
sometimes called " medieval " and sometimes " historic , " these themed christmas markets aim to recreate feudal market life in the middle ages .
visitors enter a world as it existed before electricity , when the languages spoken were middle-high german and latin .
most often , the events are held in evocative , authentic-looking locations , such as the grounds of a castle or in an historic town square .
living history one of the most impressive of these is held at burg satzvey , a 12th century moated castle in the eifel region , not far from cologne .
the castle regularly hosts medieval jousting tournaments and renaissance fairs , and , since the mid-1990s , a market with a living nativity -lrb- spoken in latin and involving a large herd of sheep -rrb- , over each of the four weekends leading up to christmas .
entering the market at satzvey is a lot like going into a living history museum .
the first thing you notice is the lack of electricity – no gaudy strings of bulbs , no fairground rides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burg satzvey at night .
instead , the castle and booths are lit by flaming torches , and people stand sipping warm drinks -lrb- glühwein did n't exist yet – how about a nice flagon of mead ? -rrb- around small open fires .
you can forget about getting french fries for the kids , though they may enjoy chunks of roasted meat on pita-like bread from a wood oven .
the only music to be heard is live : small groups of minstrels and musicians stroll about , playing ancient instruments -lrb- think sackbut and dulcimer -rrb- .
instead of fairground rides , live performers do tumbling , fire eating and juggling acts among the crowds .
talking the talk the entertainers and stall vendors alike are dressed in medieval garb , and will often pepper their german with either latin or middle-high german – demanding payment in long-extinct taler or silberlinge instead of euros -lrb- which are , nonetheless , the true coin of the realm . -rrb-
the wares that they are selling , too , differ from the traditional weinachtsmarkt fare of glittering ornaments and carved nutcrackers .
everything for sale must be hand crafted and historically appropriate , with wooden toys , baskets , musical instruments , period clothing and handmade jewelry especially heavily represented .
-lrb- if you want to buy a celtic drinking horn or a starter crossbow set for your child , you could do worse than to visit a medieval christmas market . -rrb-
no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .
the winter solstice is celebrated in a series of fire-lit short plays and ceremonies .
the market stands are decorated with natural materials , such as pine cones , acorns and chestnuts .
medieval christmas markets are found all over germany – nearly thirty were recently listed in ludwig fischer ’ s pax-et-gaudium .
for his part , fischer recommends the following five as being particularly worth a visit .
they are : 1 -rrb- dresden .
historical christmas market among the arched arcades of dresden ’ s famous stallhof building .
2 -rrb- esslingen . -lrb- near stuttgart -rrb- the medieval market starts at the beautiful baroque rathaus square , continuing under the half-timbered facades on the market square and through the narrow alleyways of the old town .
3 -rrb- burg satzvey -lrb- mechernich , near cologne / bonn -rrb- on four weekends leading up to christmas , historic christmas market and nativity scene with live animals .
4 -rrb- siegburg .
on the main market square , germany ’ s first medieval christmas market , and one of the most genuine .
with 45 stands .
5 -rrb- cologne .
at the historic chocolate museum , on the banks of the rhine .

no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .
the winter solstice is celebrated in a series of fire-lit short plays and ceremonies .
the market stands are decorated with natural materials , such as pine cones , acorns and chestnuts .
medieval christmas markets are found all over germany – nearly thirty were recently listed in ludwig fischer ’ s pax-et-gaudium .
for his part , fischer recommends the following five as being particularly worth a visit .
they are : 1 -rrb- dresden .
historical christmas market among the arched arcades of dresden ’ s famous stallhof building .
2 -rrb- esslingen . -lrb- near stuttgart -rrb- the medieval market starts at the beautiful baroque rathaus square , continuing under the half-timbered facades on the market square and through the narrow alleyways of the old town .
3 -rrb- burg satzvey -lrb- mechernich , near cologne / bonn -rrb- on four weekends leading up to christmas , historic christmas market and nativity scene with live animals .
4 -rrb- siegburg .

with 45 stands .
5 -rrb- cologne .

a key aspect of the weinachtsmarkt experience is drinking spiced mulled glühwein and eating wurst and french fries while tinny christmas carols pipe out of loudspeakers .
in recent years , though , some christmas market organizers have begun offering an alternative .
sometimes called " medieval " and sometimes " historic , " these themed christmas markets aim to recreate feudal market life in the middle ages .

most often , the events are held in evocative , authentic-looking locations , such as the grounds of a castle or in an historic town square .
living history one of the most impressive of these is held at burg satzvey , a 12th century moated castle in the eifel region , not far from cologne .
the castle regularly hosts medieval jousting tournaments and renaissance fairs , and , since the mid-1990s , a market with a living nativity -lrb- spoken in latin and involving a large herd of sheep -rrb- , over each of the four weekends leading up to christmas .
entering the market at satzvey is a lot like going into a living history museum .

instead of fairground rides , live performers do tumbling , fire eating and juggling acts among the crowds .
talking the talk the entertainers and stall vendors alike are dressed in medieval garb , and will often pepper their german with either latin or middle-high german – demanding payment in long-extinct taler or silberlinge instead of euros -lrb- which are , nonetheless , the true coin of the realm . -rrb-
the wares that they are selling , too , differ from the traditional weinachtsmarkt fare of glittering ornaments and carved nutcrackers .
everything for sale must be hand crafted and historically appropriate , with wooden toys , baskets , musical instruments , period clothing and handmade jewelry especially heavily represented .

no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .

during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .

but a new kind of market lets visitors experience the holiday as it was celebrated hundreds of years ago . more and more , germany 's countless christmas markets are coming to resemble temporary , winter-themed shopping malls .
stand after stand offers ornaments , children 's toys , candles , clothes , and various other seasonal knick-knacks .
a key aspect of the weinachtsmarkt experience is drinking spiced mulled glühwein and eating wurst and french fries while tinny christmas carols pipe out of loudspeakers .
in recent years , though , some christmas market organizers have begun offering an alternative .
sometimes called " medieval " and sometimes " historic , " these themed christmas markets aim to recreate feudal market life in the middle ages .
visitors enter a world as it existed before electricity , when the languages spoken were middle-high german and latin .
most often , the events are held in evocative , authentic-looking locations , such as the grounds of a castle or in an historic town square .
living history one of the most impressive of these is held at burg satzvey , a 12th century moated castle in the eifel region , not far from cologne .
the castle regularly hosts medieval jousting tournaments and renaissance fairs , and , since the mid-1990s , a market with a living nativity -lrb- spoken in latin and involving a large herd of sheep -rrb- , over each of the four weekends leading up to christmas .
entering the market at satzvey is a lot like going into a living history museum .
the first thing you notice is the lack of electricity – no gaudy strings of bulbs , no fairground rides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burg satzvey at night .
instead , the castle and booths are lit by flaming torches , and people stand sipping warm drinks -lrb- glühwein did n't exist yet – how about a nice flagon of mead ? -rrb- around small open fires .
you can forget about getting french fries for the kids , though they may enjoy chunks of roasted meat on pita-like bread from a wood oven .
the only music to be heard is live : small groups of minstrels and musicians stroll about , playing ancient instruments -lrb- think sackbut and dulcimer -rrb- .
instead of fairground rides , live performers do tumbling , fire eating and juggling acts among the crowds .
talking the talk the entertainers and stall vendors alike are dressed in medieval garb , and will often pepper their german with either latin or middle-high german – demanding payment in long-extinct taler or silberlinge instead of euros -lrb- which are , nonetheless , the true coin of the realm . -rrb-
the wares that they are selling , too , differ from the traditional weinachtsmarkt fare of glittering ornaments and carved nutcrackers .
everything for sale must be hand crafted and historically appropriate , with wooden toys , baskets , musical instruments , period clothing and handmade jewelry especially heavily represented .
-lrb- if you want to buy a celtic drinking horn or a starter crossbow set for your child , you could do worse than to visit a medieval christmas market . -rrb-
no one can say for sure how many medieval and historic christmas markets take place in germany – the markets are run by a varied group of hobbyists and event organizers .
but the number has been steadily growing since they first appeared in the early 1990s , says ludwig fischer , editor in chief of pax-et-gaudium , a magazine for middle ages hobbyists and professionals .
a hidden hotplate because there is no official oversight , fischer explains , some markets are more historically correct than others .
many of them are simply " a mixture of romanticism and the middle ages , " he says .
some use the term " historic " instead of medieval , giving them more leeway when it comes to historic accuracy .
in those cases , for example , it could be ok to use an electric hotplate to keep food warm as long as it stays well hidden .
or , vendors may appear to be wearing period garments , but underneath the sheepskin throw is a layer of modern clothes in high-tech , insulating fibers .
burg satzvey also bills its market as " historic , " thus allowing the presence of a beautiful – but electrically powered - carousel from the last century .
the organizers of two other major medieval christmas markets , in siegburg -lrb- near bonn -rrb- and cologne , take the historic aspect more seriously .
christian and pagan kramer zunft & kurzweyl is one of the oldest organizers of medieval events in germany ; their market in siegburg , which runs for the three full weeks leading up to christmas , is the oldest and one of the largest , with 45 stands .
it concentrates on the christian aspects of the holiday , with nightly torch-lit carol singing and a nativity play on weekends .
during the week , school groups visit the various craftspeople to learn about such disappearing arts as blacksmithing and calligraphy .
a smaller market cologne , in the shadow of a small castle housing the chcolate museum , focuses on the pagan christmas rituals , which , according to hella von beckerath of kramer zunft , existed alongside the christian rituals in the middle ages .
the winter solstice is celebrated in a series of fire-lit short plays and ceremonies .
the market stands are decorated with natural materials , such as pine cones , acorns and chestnuts .
medieval christmas markets are found all over germany – nearly thirty were recently listed in ludwig fischer ’ s pax-et-gaudium .
for his part , fischer recommends the following five as being particularly worth a visit .
they are : 1 -rrb- dresden .
historical christmas market among the arched arcades of dresden ’ s famous stallhof building .
2 -rrb- esslingen . -lrb- near stuttgart -rrb- the medieval market starts at the beautiful baroque rathaus square , continuing under the half-timbered facades on the market square and through the narrow alleyways of the old town .
3 -rrb- burg satzvey -lrb- mechernich , near cologne / bonn -rrb- on four weekends leading up to christmas , historic christmas market and nativity scene with live animals .
4 -rrb- siegburg .
on the main market square , germany ’ s first medieval christmas market , and one of the most genuine .
with 45 stands .
5 -rrb- cologne .
at the historic chocolate museum , on the banks of the rhine .

followers of the fashionable low carbohydrate , high protein diet were advised that mixing it with other weight-loss programmes could be dangerous .
in particular , it could be " deadly " to mix high carbohydrate foods with high fat foods , collette heimowitz , vice president of atkins health and medical information services , told the bbc .
she made the comments in an interview with the real story programme , following an experiment in which three doctors followed the diet for a month on behalf of the show .
' worse and worse ' one of the doctors was hospitalised and given morphine to control chronic stomach pains .
he had to be fed intravenously .
i was very , very , very cold because with the pain i was sweating profusely and then shivering dr maurice gleeson maurice gleeson , 42 , a psychiatrist in london , was taken to hospital after suffering from acute constipation .
dr gleeson said : " the pain just started getting worse and worse .
i could not find any position that was comfortable so in the end i called an ambulance .
" i was concerned i would need an operation to unblock the bowel . "
the former a & e doctor said that if there is complete obstruction of the bowel it can lead to death .
" i was very , very , very cold because with the pain i was sweating profusely and then shivering .
i was very , very shut down - my fingers were blue , " he said .
" i was almost crying on several occasions because i have never had pain like this before .
i was completely convinced that was due to the atkins diet . "
' chocolate biscuits ' dr gleeson fell ill after a month on the diet , which has been tried by four million britons in the last five years .
dr sarah brewer found the diet very successful he kept a video diary for the duration of the diet and admitted to deviating from the low carb , high fat regime on a number of occasions .
he drank small quantities of alcohol and ate ten chocolate biscuits .
then , when the pains in his intestine became so severe , he ate bread and drank mango juice " to try and get things moving " .
a few hours later , he had to call the ambulance .
' when you cheat ' commenting on dr gleeson 's ordeal , ms heimowitz said he had cheated and had not actually been on the diet .
she said : " when you cheat with alcohol , when you cheat with juice , when you cheat with bread , you 're switching back to a carbohydrate metabolism .
" it 's a different metabolism , so the risk factors associated with high carb ' , high fat is the most deadliest of combinations and you 're not on the programme if that 's what you 're doing .
" the only reason why taking in high fat is safe is because you 're burning it as a primary source of fuel . "
very successful another doctor who tested the diet , gill jenkins , an air ambulance doctor and gp , found that her levels of " bad " cholesterol had risen above a clinically safe level .
but medical journalist dr sarah brewer found the programme very successful .
her bad cholesterol fell slightly and so did her fat tissue .
she lost 11lbs in weight and has decided to continue with the atkins diet .
aggressive efforts ms heimowitz said only highly motivated individuals should follow the diet .
she said people who suffer from side effects should see a doctor and follow their advice .
the company was making aggressive efforts to educate doctors about the atkins diet , ms heimowitz said .

the 41-year-old talks to bbc news online about how she campaigns for disabled rights through her art .
my take on disability , is that to describe someone as disabled is , in a way , absolute nonsense .
we are all this unique mixture of strengths and weaknesses - it does n't matter if they are emotional , physical or intellectual .
and this can change the course of our lives .
anyone can become disabled .
from the disability rights perspective it is not the disability that is the impairment but the way you are treated in society .
we must to remember that over the course of our lives , unless we die tragically young , we are all going to become disabled ju gosling in pictures : ju gosling 's work there are false ideas and perceptions , so that the only images you see of people that are not regarded as physically perfect , are either charitable or medical images .
mostly though , disabled people are invisible .
because of my illness i am largely house-bound , so i ca n't really go out and chain myself to a bus .
so i try to raise awareness using the opportunities i have as an artist to highlight issues and generate debate .
newham , the area in which i live , has a reputation for being poor and very hard - which it is .
but for me it is a very good area to live in .
there has been lots of work done on very basic things like dropped kerbs .
disabled london 2003 is the european year for disabled people there are more than 1.4m disabled people in london - about 20 % of the city 's population 17 % of working age londoners are disabled - about 810,000 people from minority ethnic groups are more likely to be disabled than people from white groups in 2001/2 the unemployment rate for disabled londoners was 11 % compared to 6.2 % for non-disabled londoners during 2001/2 the average hourly rate of pay for disabled londoners was £ 10.25 - compared to £ 12.74 for non-disabled people 39 % of disabled 16-24 year olds participate in some form of education compared to 50 % of young non-disabled londoners but also many of the shopping centres are accessible , the local buses are great , there are accessible stations , the docklands light railway has always been accessible and the jubilee line is accessible .
even on the streets , you might get some tough looking kids but even they will hold doors open for you or apologise if they get in your way .
on the other hand central london can be unnecessarily difficult .
i do n't think there is any real recognition that in many other parts of the world the situation is much better .
you do see shops where the steps are so small that it would have been just as easy to put in wheelchair access ramps or stores so cramped that you ca n't get your wheelchair round .
i think things are changing but not quickly enough .
i would like to see ken livingstone do more .
city hall is a brand new building , but it 's horrendously difficult for disabled people to use on a number of levels .
ms gosling tries to inspire debate about disability through her art often it is the staff rather than the building that makes somewhere wheelchair accessible .
i think transport is a huge issue in terms of improving the tube and the buses and not just saying we 'll do it in another 20 years time .
blue badge holders may be exempt from the congestion charge but some people who ca n't climb steps or have mental health problems still have to use their cars .
they are not eligible for a blue badge and are being unfairly penalised .

breakfast tested your grammar this morning .
we asked whether you knew your colon from your hyphen or if you knew where to stick your apostrophe .
so , does it all matter ?
our guest lynne truss thought so , she said we 've got ourselves into " punctuation anarchy " .
she has written a book on the subject , " eats , shoots and leaves " send us your thoughts : name your e-mail address town or city comments disclaimer : the bbc may edit your comments and can not guarantee that all e-mails will be published .
lynne truss says she never expected the book to be a success , publishers thought it was for a niche market , but somehow the book and the way it is written has really captured the market .
lynne talks about punctuation marks as characters : the exclamation mark has no volume control and should not be used by comic writers .
it can also be used to indicate self effacement .
she says the title of the book comes from a joke about a panda going into a bar and ordering a sandwich , it then fires a gun and walks out of the pub .
the barman asks him why - and the panda throws him a badly punctuated wildlife book and tells him to look up panda .
the barman turns to the right page and reads " panda : bear-like mammal native to china .

ashikaga bank , from tochigi to the north of tokyo , admitted on saturday that it had gone bust .
the government immediately announced that it was taking over all ashikaga shares , making the bank the second to fall into public hands this year .
the news calmed uncertainty about the bank , and the nikkei index leapt 3 % .
the closing level was 10,403.27 , a rise of 302.7 points for a three-week high .
the dollar was rising on monday as well , as positive economic data in the us combined with a long weekend for the us thanksgiving holiday .
at the close on monday in tokyo , the dollar was worth 109.56 yen , up 0.22 yen on friday .
the market gains accompanied news from the bank of japan that it is planning to inject one trillion yen -lrb- $ 9.1bn ; £ 5.3bn -rrb- into the markets to stabilise them following the nationalisation .
help ashikaga 's shares officially passed into public ownership on monday morning , in the wake of the bank 's announcement on saturday that its debts exceeded its assets .
earlier this year , the ministry of finance took over failing resona bank , which last week turned in trillion-yen losses at a time when many of the nation 's banks were finally moving into the black .
but the recovery was limited to the big national banks , and many fear that more in the regional sector may follow where ashikaga has led .
ashikaga has already been bailed out once , when the government sunk 135bn yen into its coffers to try to support its balance sheet .
that money , one official said , will " very probably prove unrecoverable " .
the ministry of finance will hold ashikaga 's shares till a buyer can be found , e-mail this to a friend printable version see also : japan bank bail-out ' a one-off ' 30 nov 03 -pipe- business japan 's banks head back to profit 25 nov 03 -pipe- business japan 's revival gathers strength 21 nov 03 -pipe- business exports underpin growth in japan 14 nov 03 -pipe- business economy dominates japan poll 07 nov 03 -pipe- business japan 's trade surplus grows 25 aug 03 -pipe- business japan 's nikkei tops 10,000 18 aug 03 -pipe- business related internet links : japanese ministry of finance ashikaga bank -lrb- japanese -rrb- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories strong demand boosts intel profit rio resumes australia investment unemployment dips to 2.47 million products and services e-mail news mobiles alerts news feeds podcasts news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health have your say -pipe- in pictures -pipe- week at a glance -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes bbc copyright notice mmx most popular now -pipe- 14,557 pages were read in the last minute .

last week plaid cymru 's health spokesman rhodri glyn thomas issued a challenge to his own party to " wake up " and engage with the debate on greater powers for the assembly .
ieuan wyn jones - hits out at tuition fees " deceit " he said there was a vacuum at the centre of the party 's policy between the status quo and plaid 's constitutional aim of full independence .

the party leadership says the transfer of powers over tuition fees , part of the higher education package announced in last week 's queen 's speech , is pointless without cast iron guarantees that more funding will be made available .
plaid cymru leader in the welsh assembly ieuan wyn jones said : " everyone sees through this latest deceit .
top up fees are unfair and immoral .
if cash is n't given then let the powers stay in westminster ieuan wyn jones " giving the power to decide about them to the assembly is just downright cynical if the extra cash is n't there .
" there can only be a real choice if extra money is up front .
new labour is trying to use the assembly to push through its own unpopular policies .
" peter hain has indicated as much in his comments on the matter .
frankly no more cash means no real choice .
" if the cash is n't given then let the powers stay in westminster . "
last week plaid cymru 's health spokesman rhodri glyn thomas issued a challenge to his own party to " wake up " and engage with the debate on greater powers for the assembly .
ieuan wyn jones - hits out at tuition fees " deceit " he said there was a vacuum at the centre of the party 's policy between the status quo and plaid 's constitutional aim of full independence .

" you can only do what you can do .
you do the very best job you can ...
i do n't think i have any regrets . "
sean astin , who played hobbit sam gamgee , said the première was " a moment of great national pride ... and it feels like a little bit of history here " .
many fans had travelled from around the world to see the event .

" so since then , i 've been waiting forever for the première . "

the country 's chief banking watchdog said on monday that it would pick one or two of the biggest four state banks to test its plans for reconstruction .
the regulator also outlined moves to ease foreign banks ' entry into the financial services market , allowing more investment in local banks .
the aim is to cut back on the bad debts estimated at 2 trillion yuan -lrb- $ 242bn ; £ 140bn -rrb- which are hobbling lending .
at a news conference in beijing , the china banking regulatory commission -lrb- cbrc -rrb- chief liu mingkang told reporters that non-performing loans amounted to 22 % of overall bank lending .
all very positive stuff sunil garg , fox-pitt kelton some analysts fear the real figure could be twice as high , making reforms even more urgent .
the debts have been built up in the form of lending to loss-making state-owned enterprises or at the behest of senior figures in the communist party , and are unlikely ever to be repaid .
caution the step-by-step approach of the cbrc is likely to be welcomed by observers as an antidote to a mass bailout , which has been tried unsuccessfully in the past .
the clean-up is necessary to prepare for an opening of the banking market under china 's world trade organisation commitments .
the relaxation of limitations on foreign banks also unveiled on monday included a lowering of the requirements for the amount of capital that foreign bank branches must hold .
the limit is to drop to 500m yuan from 600m yuan , mr liu said .
and four cities are to be added to the list of places where foreigners can do business , taking the total to 13 .
" all very positive stuff , " said sunil garg , banking analyst at fox-pitt kelton in hong kong .
" the government is quite serious about accelerating the bank reform process . "
but he warned that despite the possibility of more foreign investment , the size of the bad loan problem was still worrying .

the minimum fine for breaking the law is £ 30 , but police are expected to be lenient with offenders - at least for the first two months .
hands-free kits are allowed , but many road safety experts say they do not reduce the risks of having an accident .
despite the changes a survey of drivers found 94 % were unaware of the changes - even though a quarter admitted phoning or texting while behind the wheel .
verbal warnings police forces can issue on-the-spot fines from monday , but the association of chief police officers has recommended that officers in england and wales give drivers a period of grace to get used to the new laws .
what are the new rules ?
apply from 1 december new offence of " using a hand-held phone while driving " £ 30 fixed penalty fine rising to up to £ 1,000 if the matter goes to court rising to up to £ 2,500 for drivers of vans , buses , coaches and lorries the highway dialling code drivers in scotland , however , have been given no such concession .
offending motorists south of the border can expect verbal warnings until february in order to " assist in the education of drivers " .
but police will still be able to hand out instant fines if they feel a driver 's use of a mobile phone poses a serious risk , or if their use contributes to a collision .
and road safety minister david jamieson said that while the new ban applies only to hand-held mobile phones " police can use other powers to prosecute a driver if they are distracted by a call on a hands-free phone " .
hands-free kits road safety charity brake fears some phone companies will exploit the ban to promote their hands-free models .
calling for a ban on the use of all phones by drivers , its chief executive , mary williams said : " the use of hands-free kits while driving may not be illegal yet , but they certainly do not make driving any safer . "
have your say it is already illegal to drive without due care , so why does the government think introducing new laws will make driving safer ?
martin , england send us your comments the royal society for the prevention of accidents said : " at least 20 people have died on britain 's roads in crashes where mobile phones have been implicated . "
the aa motoring trust said drivers using mobiles were four times more likely to have an accident even if they were employing hands-free devices .
but mr jamieson said a ban on hands-free devices would be extremely difficult to enforce , though he did not rule out an extension of the law if further measures are needed .
he said the general advice to drivers remained that they should turn their phones off while driving , and pull over if they needed to make or receive a call .
text messages a survey of 1,000 motorists by tesco suggested more than nine out of 10 drivers were unaware of the changes .
a separate study by sainsbury 's said that almost nine million people used a hand-held mobile phone while driving during the last year .
of those 709,000 said that using their phone has nearly caused them to have an accident .
a spokesman for the bank said : " our research reveals that 10 % of motorists key in text messages while driving , 15 % read messages and 16 % answer calls . "
but a roadside straw poll by roger harrabin , correspondent for bbc radio 4 's today programme , suggested mobile phone use by drivers had slightly declined compared to last year .
van drivers in his rather unscientific study - conducted by standing at a busy junction in north london for an hour - he spotted only two drivers using hand-held mobile phones compared to eight in an hour last year .
however , he did see rather a lot of drivers evidently using hands-free kits and holding earnest conversations with their dashboards - without paying full attention to the road .
roger harrabin says the new ban should be communicated forcefully to commercial van drivers , for whom using mobile phones while driving may have become a business imperative .

the minimum fine for breaking the law is £ 30 , but police are expected to be lenient with offenders - at least for the first two months .
hands-free kits are allowed , but many road safety experts say they do not reduce the risks of having an accident .
despite the changes a survey of drivers found 94 % were unaware of the changes - even though a quarter admitted phoning or texting while behind the wheel .
verbal warnings police forces can issue on-the-spot fines from monday , but the association of chief police officers has recommended that officers in england and wales give drivers a period of grace to get used to the new laws .
what are the new rules ?
apply from 1 december new offence of " using a hand-held phone while driving " £ 30 fixed penalty fine rising to up to £ 1,000 if the matter goes to court rising to up to £ 2,500 for drivers of vans , buses , coaches and lorries the highway dialling code drivers in scotland , however , have been given no such concession .
offending motorists south of the border can expect verbal warnings until february in order to " assist in the education of drivers " .
but police will still be able to hand out instant fines if they feel a driver 's use of a mobile phone poses a serious risk , or if their use contributes to a collision .
and road safety minister david jamieson said that while the new ban applies only to hand-held mobile phones " police can use other powers to prosecute a driver if they are distracted by a call on a hands-free phone " .
hands-free kits road safety charity brake fears some phone companies will exploit the ban to promote their hands-free models .
calling for a ban on the use of all phones by drivers , its chief executive , mary williams said : " the use of hands-free kits while driving may not be illegal yet , but they certainly do not make driving any safer . "
have your say it is already illegal to drive without due care , so why does the government think introducing new laws will make driving safer ?
martin , england send us your comments the royal society for the prevention of accidents said : " at least 20 people have died on britain 's roads in crashes where mobile phones have been implicated . "
the aa motoring trust said drivers using mobiles were four times more likely to have an accident even if they were employing hands-free devices .
but mr jamieson said a ban on hands-free devices would be extremely difficult to enforce , though he did not rule out an extension of the law if further measures are needed .
he said the general advice to drivers remained that they should turn their phones off while driving , and pull over if they needed to make or receive a call .
text messages a survey of 1,000 motorists by tesco suggested more than nine out of 10 drivers were unaware of the changes .
a separate study by sainsbury 's said that almost nine million people used a hand-held mobile phone while driving during the last year .

a spokesman for the bank said : " our research reveals that 10 % of motorists key in text messages while driving , 15 % read messages and 16 % answer calls . "
but a roadside straw poll by roger harrabin , correspondent for bbc radio 4 's today programme , suggested mobile phone use by drivers had slightly declined compared to last year .
van drivers in his rather unscientific study - conducted by standing at a busy junction in north london for an hour - he spotted only two drivers using hand-held mobile phones compared to eight in an hour last year .
however , he did see rather a lot of drivers evidently using hands-free kits and holding earnest conversations with their dashboards - without paying full attention to the road .
