genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban . the transatlantic dispute over genetically-modified food flared up this week with u.s. president george w. bush accusing the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight with its obstructionist stance .
speaking at the annual conference of the biotechnology industry organization -lrb- bio -rrb- in washington on monday , bush said european governments had blocked the import of biotechnology crops " based on unfounded and unscientific fears . "
the president stressed that as a result many african nations were afraid to use gm crops for fear they would not get access to european markets .
" for the sake of a continent threatened by famine , i urge european nations to end their opposition to biotechnology , " he added .
eu officials vehemently rejected bush ’ s comments .
" the suggestions made by the united states are simply not true , " european commission spokesman gerassimos thomas told a daily news briefing on tuesday .
" it is false that we are anti-biotechnology or anti-developing countries . "
eu outlaws gm food the transatlantic row over genetically-modified food is not new .
the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials .
however , officials are working on a system of labeling existing gm foods so that european consumers can choose whether to buy them .
the european parliament is also due to vote on the rules next week , a move which could lead the way for the ban to be lifted .
gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
" no one really knows what the long-term impact of gm will be on our health or the environment , " spokeswoman clare oxborrow of green group friends of the earth told reuters .
" consumers in europe know this and have made it perfectly clear that they do n't want to eat gm food . "
eu ban hurting the u.s. for his part president bush has argued that the eu ban was not just hurting u.s.-produced crops , but also influencing other countries , especially in the developing world , to oppose gm crops when they could benefit immensely from them .
last year , several african countries like zambia rejected gm food aid from the u.s. despite suffering severe food shortages .
" we are not going to accept gm food until there is a world consensus on its safety for human consumption , " zambia ’ s commerce , trade and industry minister dipak patel told reuters on tuesday .
the eu ban is also having an impact on the large u.s. biotech industry .
gene-spliced crops account for 75 percent of u.s. soybeans , 71 percent of cotton and 34 percent of corn , making the u.s. the world leader in biotech crops .
the u.s. has launched a trade suit with the world trade organization to overturn the eu restrictions , which have crippled gm exports to the eu in the last five years .
u.s. corn farmers say they are losing about $ 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
gm hype all hogwash ?
proponents of gm technology argue it will increase farm yields , lower costs and provide enough food for a hungry world .
but critics of gm food don ’ t buy the argument .
they accuse the u.s. president of having only the interests of powerful american biotech companies in mind and have pooh-poohed his concern over helping the developing world .
" it is nonsense , " patrick holden of environmental group soil association told reuters .
" even serious experts on gm will concede that there is no evidence that gm can make any greater contribution to feeding the world than existing agricultural science . "
while the gm food debate continues unabated back and forth across the atlantic , the latest round of bickering could hardly have come at a worse time .

the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .
britain 's presence was longterm , the paper wrote , and that truth had to be openly expressed .
the situation in iraq has become precarious , unstable and dangerous , wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
it 's a moot point and a bit arrogant to muse now whether washington 's post-war planning was sloppy or amateurish .
given the ethnic , religious and political complexities , the paper 's editors wrote , even the most thorough planning probably could n't have prevented the chaos .
it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
kommersant in moscow likened the situations in afghanistan and iraq .
in both countries , it observed , opponents of foreign military occupation are resisting in the same way .
like a phoenix from the ashes , taliban leader mullah omar is calling for holy war in afghanistan , while in iraq the coalition troops are having to mount a large operation to extinguish pockets of resistance that are growing by the day .
de morgen in belgium wrote that it could see the seed of one of the biggest trade crises ever between the european union and the united states in genetically changed foods .
enormous interests are at stake , the brussels paper wrote , with american maize growers saying they lose $ 300 million a year because of a european import ban on genetically modified maize .
the kronenzeitung in austria criticized israeli settlement policy .
before the country is ultimately split and borders are negotiated , it says , prime minister ariel sharon is having the lines drawn to meet his strategic needs , the aim being to incorporate in israel as many settlements on arab soil as possible .
el país in madrid wrote that it saw mismanagement , radical nationalism , corruption and crime flourishing in albania , bosnia , croatia , macedonia and serbia-montenegro , which have been promised eu membership .
if this " last black hole in europe , " as the paper called it , wanted to come in , these countries would need to be ruled by law , mercilessly fight organized crime and make no exceptions for notorious war criminals .
aftenposten in norway offered praise for the belgian government 's decision to change a 10-year-old law that allowed prosecution of war crimes committed by anyone , anywhere , to apply only to belgian citizens or people living in the country .
the u.s. had put belgium under great pressure over the issue , noted the oslo paper , deploring that washington continues to deny any jurisdiction over american citizens by the international criminal court .
war criminals and others who commit excesses in war , wrote the aftenposten , have to know that they can be held accountable for their actions by the international community .
le monde in paris lauded president jacques chirac 's intention to change the constitution so that a french president can be removed from office .
the paper wrote that because there needs to be national continuity , jurists do n't want a president bothered by court proceedings , but political accountability needs to be strengthened by a proper procedure for removing a president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.06.2003 germany 's fischer returns from mideast peace tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer met egyptian president hosni mubarak , as well as the leaders of syria and lebanon .
german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .
his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace . on tuesday , fischer met with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo , after previously meeting with the leaders of syria and lebanon at the beginning of the week to garner arab support for peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . while in cairo , he called on the radical group hamas to implement a “ lasting ceasefire ” to help move towards implementing the road map unveiled by united states president george bush in april .
the plan foresees the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 in exchange for peaceful co-existence with israel . “ the fact that the international community - in particular the usa and europe - are so completely engaged can really add momentum towards a lasting solution to the middle east conflict between israel and it 's arab neighbors , " fischer said . however , renewed violence and a number of controversial issues threaten to derail the road map .
the plan is being shepherded by a group know as the quartet – which is made up of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia . a neutral broker although fischer downplayed expectations for his four-day visit to the troubled region , his reputation as an neutral broker had raised some hopes for a breakthrough .
he suggested the prospect of a constructive role both syria and lebanon could play in the peace process . although much of recent u.s. focus has been simply on getting israelis and palestinians talking again , both syria and lebanon are considered key to the region 's final stability .

german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .
his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace . on tuesday , fischer met with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo , after previously meeting with the leaders of syria and lebanon at the beginning of the week to garner arab support for peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . while in cairo , he called on the radical group hamas to implement a “ lasting ceasefire ” to help move towards implementing the road map unveiled by united states president george bush in april .
the plan foresees the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 in exchange for peaceful co-existence with israel . “ the fact that the international community - in particular the usa and europe - are so completely engaged can really add momentum towards a lasting solution to the middle east conflict between israel and it 's arab neighbors , " fischer said . however , renewed violence and a number of controversial issues threaten to derail the road map .
the plan is being shepherded by a group know as the quartet – which is made up of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia . a neutral broker although fischer downplayed expectations for his four-day visit to the troubled region , his reputation as an neutral broker had raised some hopes for a breakthrough .

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .

u.s. sees hamas as obstacle to mideast peace the u.s. , which recently brokered a landmark agreement between palestinian and israeli leaders , has long listed hamas as a " foreign terrorist organization . "
president bush has singled it out as the biggest hurdle to a u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace and wants the eu to follow suit by outlawing the group ’ s political wing .
" the true tests for hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks , their capacity to blow up the peace process , " bush said .
he urged leaders in europe and elsewhere to " take swift , decisive action " against hamas and other groups , including cutting off funding .
but france opposes the move , insisting that hamas is a necessary player in the region ’ s peace process .
hamas ’ military wing , responsible for several suicide attacks on israel since the beginning of the three-year-old intifada , or uprising , against the occupation of palestinian territories , is already on an eu list of banned terrorist groups whose assets may be seized .
the u.s. also called on european nations to sideline palestinian president yasser arafat , whom israel and washington accuse of inciting anti-israel violence .

leaders intensify anti-terror cooperation but despite the differences , the summit was seen as an important opportunity for leaders to put behind their past animosity , at a time when transatlantic relations are at an historic low , and pursue common goals .

indeed , leaders reached deals on a series of outstanding issues on boosting anti-terror cooperation .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .
the two sides are also expected to embrace a legal assistance agreement that will allow u.s. and eu law enforcement agencies mutual access to bank accounts to trace terrorist funding .
further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2003 european press review : tony under pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles have long since disappeared for tony blair 's iraq mission .
the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .
britain 's presence was longterm , the paper wrote , and that truth had to be openly expressed .
the situation in iraq has become precarious , unstable and dangerous , wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
it 's a moot point and a bit arrogant to muse now whether washington 's post-war planning was sloppy or amateurish .
given the ethnic , religious and political complexities , the paper 's editors wrote , even the most thorough planning probably could n't have prevented the chaos .
it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
kommersant in moscow likened the situations in afghanistan and iraq .
in both countries , it observed , opponents of foreign military occupation are resisting in the same way .
like a phoenix from the ashes , taliban leader mullah omar is calling for holy war in afghanistan , while in iraq the coalition troops are having to mount a large operation to extinguish pockets of resistance that are growing by the day .
de morgen in belgium wrote that it could see the seed of one of the biggest trade crises ever between the european union and the united states in genetically changed foods .
enormous interests are at stake , the brussels paper wrote , with american maize growers saying they lose $ 300 million a year because of a european import ban on genetically modified maize .
the kronenzeitung in austria criticized israeli settlement policy .
before the country is ultimately split and borders are negotiated , it says , prime minister ariel sharon is having the lines drawn to meet his strategic needs , the aim being to incorporate in israel as many settlements on arab soil as possible .
el país in madrid wrote that it saw mismanagement , radical nationalism , corruption and crime flourishing in albania , bosnia , croatia , macedonia and serbia-montenegro , which have been promised eu membership .
if this " last black hole in europe , " as the paper called it , wanted to come in , these countries would need to be ruled by law , mercilessly fight organized crime and make no exceptions for notorious war criminals .
aftenposten in norway offered praise for the belgian government 's decision to change a 10-year-old law that allowed prosecution of war crimes committed by anyone , anywhere , to apply only to belgian citizens or people living in the country .
the u.s. had put belgium under great pressure over the issue , noted the oslo paper , deploring that washington continues to deny any jurisdiction over american citizens by the international criminal court .
war criminals and others who commit excesses in war , wrote the aftenposten , have to know that they can be held accountable for their actions by the international community .
le monde in paris lauded president jacques chirac 's intention to change the constitution so that a french president can be removed from office .
the paper wrote that because there needs to be national continuity , jurists do n't want a president bothered by court proceedings , but political accountability needs to be strengthened by a proper procedure for removing a president .
doubtlessly , it added , chirac 's initiative will bring clarification and modernization to a decisive element of the constitution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban . the transatlantic dispute over genetically-modified food flared up this week with u.s. president george w. bush accusing the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight with its obstructionist stance .
speaking at the annual conference of the biotechnology industry organization -lrb- bio -rrb- in washington on monday , bush said european governments had blocked the import of biotechnology crops " based on unfounded and unscientific fears . "
the president stressed that as a result many african nations were afraid to use gm crops for fear they would not get access to european markets .
" for the sake of a continent threatened by famine , i urge european nations to end their opposition to biotechnology , " he added .
eu officials vehemently rejected bush ’ s comments .
" the suggestions made by the united states are simply not true , " european commission spokesman gerassimos thomas told a daily news briefing on tuesday .
" it is false that we are anti-biotechnology or anti-developing countries . "
eu outlaws gm food the transatlantic row over genetically-modified food is not new .
the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials .
however , officials are working on a system of labeling existing gm foods so that european consumers can choose whether to buy them .
the european parliament is also due to vote on the rules next week , a move which could lead the way for the ban to be lifted .
gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
" no one really knows what the long-term impact of gm will be on our health or the environment , " spokeswoman clare oxborrow of green group friends of the earth told reuters .
" consumers in europe know this and have made it perfectly clear that they do n't want to eat gm food . "
eu ban hurting the u.s. for his part president bush has argued that the eu ban was not just hurting u.s.-produced crops , but also influencing other countries , especially in the developing world , to oppose gm crops when they could benefit immensely from them .
last year , several african countries like zambia rejected gm food aid from the u.s. despite suffering severe food shortages .
" we are not going to accept gm food until there is a world consensus on its safety for human consumption , " zambia ’ s commerce , trade and industry minister dipak patel told reuters on tuesday .
the eu ban is also having an impact on the large u.s. biotech industry .
gene-spliced crops account for 75 percent of u.s. soybeans , 71 percent of cotton and 34 percent of corn , making the u.s. the world leader in biotech crops .
the u.s. has launched a trade suit with the world trade organization to overturn the eu restrictions , which have crippled gm exports to the eu in the last five years .
u.s. corn farmers say they are losing about $ 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
gm hype all hogwash ?
proponents of gm technology argue it will increase farm yields , lower costs and provide enough food for a hungry world .
but critics of gm food don ’ t buy the argument .
they accuse the u.s. president of having only the interests of powerful american biotech companies in mind and have pooh-poohed his concern over helping the developing world .
" it is nonsense , " patrick holden of environmental group soil association told reuters .
" even serious experts on gm will concede that there is no evidence that gm can make any greater contribution to feeding the world than existing agricultural science . "
while the gm food debate continues unabated back and forth across the atlantic , the latest round of bickering could hardly have come at a worse time .

genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban . the transatlantic dispute over genetically-modified food flared up this week with u.s. president george w. bush accusing the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight with its obstructionist stance .
speaking at the annual conference of the biotechnology industry organization -lrb- bio -rrb- in washington on monday , bush said european governments had blocked the import of biotechnology crops " based on unfounded and unscientific fears . "
the president stressed that as a result many african nations were afraid to use gm crops for fear they would not get access to european markets .
" for the sake of a continent threatened by famine , i urge european nations to end their opposition to biotechnology , " he added .
eu officials vehemently rejected bush ’ s comments .
" the suggestions made by the united states are simply not true , " european commission spokesman gerassimos thomas told a daily news briefing on tuesday .
" it is false that we are anti-biotechnology or anti-developing countries . "
eu outlaws gm food the transatlantic row over genetically-modified food is not new .
the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials .
however , officials are working on a system of labeling existing gm foods so that european consumers can choose whether to buy them .
the european parliament is also due to vote on the rules next week , a move which could lead the way for the ban to be lifted .
gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
" no one really knows what the long-term impact of gm will be on our health or the environment , " spokeswoman clare oxborrow of green group friends of the earth told reuters .
" consumers in europe know this and have made it perfectly clear that they do n't want to eat gm food . "
eu ban hurting the u.s. for his part president bush has argued that the eu ban was not just hurting u.s.-produced crops , but also influencing other countries , especially in the developing world , to oppose gm crops when they could benefit immensely from them .
last year , several african countries like zambia rejected gm food aid from the u.s. despite suffering severe food shortages .
" we are not going to accept gm food until there is a world consensus on its safety for human consumption , " zambia ’ s commerce , trade and industry minister dipak patel told reuters on tuesday .
the eu ban is also having an impact on the large u.s. biotech industry .
gene-spliced crops account for 75 percent of u.s. soybeans , 71 percent of cotton and 34 percent of corn , making the u.s. the world leader in biotech crops .
the u.s. has launched a trade suit with the world trade organization to overturn the eu restrictions , which have crippled gm exports to the eu in the last five years .
u.s. corn farmers say they are losing about $ 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
gm hype all hogwash ?
proponents of gm technology argue it will increase farm yields , lower costs and provide enough food for a hungry world .
but critics of gm food don ’ t buy the argument .
they accuse the u.s. president of having only the interests of powerful american biotech companies in mind and have pooh-poohed his concern over helping the developing world .
" it is nonsense , " patrick holden of environmental group soil association told reuters .
" even serious experts on gm will concede that there is no evidence that gm can make any greater contribution to feeding the world than existing agricultural science . "

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .
" in order for there to be peace in the middle east , we must see organizations such as hamas dismantled , " bush said .
u.s. sees hamas as obstacle to mideast peace the u.s. , which recently brokered a landmark agreement between palestinian and israeli leaders , has long listed hamas as a " foreign terrorist organization . "
president bush has singled it out as the biggest hurdle to a u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace and wants the eu to follow suit by outlawing the group ’ s political wing .
" the true tests for hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks , their capacity to blow up the peace process , " bush said .
he urged leaders in europe and elsewhere to " take swift , decisive action " against hamas and other groups , including cutting off funding .
but france opposes the move , insisting that hamas is a necessary player in the region ’ s peace process .
hamas ’ military wing , responsible for several suicide attacks on israel since the beginning of the three-year-old intifada , or uprising , against the occupation of palestinian territories , is already on an eu list of banned terrorist groups whose assets may be seized .
the u.s. also called on european nations to sideline palestinian president yasser arafat , whom israel and washington accuse of inciting anti-israel violence .
the controversy over genetically-modified food , which has snowballed into a major transatlantic trade dispute , also topped the agenda and officials said they saw little chance of progress .
on tuesday , president bush enraged eu officials by implying in a speech europe was indirectly contributing to famine in africa by refusing to lift its ban on gm food .
leaders intensify anti-terror cooperation but despite the differences , the summit was seen as an important opportunity for leaders to put behind their past animosity , at a time when transatlantic relations are at an historic low , and pursue common goals .
greek government spokesman christos protopapas said the europeans hoped the summit would " constitute the starting point for a new era in the strategic partnership between the united states and europe after the tension that existed in recent months . "
indeed , leaders reached deals on a series of outstanding issues on boosting anti-terror cooperation .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .
the two sides are also expected to embrace a legal assistance agreement that will allow u.s. and eu law enforcement agencies mutual access to bank accounts to trace terrorist funding .
further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .
the leaders expanded the range of offenses that qualify for extradition , and the eu , which opposes capital punishment , won the right to refuse extradition in cases where the death penalty may be imposed .
u.s. attorney general john ashcroft lauded the anti-terror agreements reached at the summit .
" these treaties focus not on our differences , but on our common values , " he said .
eu commission president romano prodi underscored the importance of transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terror .
" when europe and the united states are united , no problem and no enemy can stand against us , " he said .

the controversy over genetically-modified food , which has snowballed into a major transatlantic trade dispute , also topped the agenda and officials said they saw little chance of progress .
on tuesday , president bush enraged eu officials by implying in a speech europe was indirectly contributing to famine in africa by refusing to lift its ban on gm food .
leaders intensify anti-terror cooperation but despite the differences , the summit was seen as an important opportunity for leaders to put behind their past animosity , at a time when transatlantic relations are at an historic low , and pursue common goals .
greek government spokesman christos protopapas said the europeans hoped the summit would " constitute the starting point for a new era in the strategic partnership between the united states and europe after the tension that existed in recent months . "
indeed , leaders reached deals on a series of outstanding issues on boosting anti-terror cooperation .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .
the two sides are also expected to embrace a legal assistance agreement that will allow u.s. and eu law enforcement agencies mutual access to bank accounts to trace terrorist funding .
further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .
the leaders expanded the range of offenses that qualify for extradition , and the eu , which opposes capital punishment , won the right to refuse extradition in cases where the death penalty may be imposed .
u.s. attorney general john ashcroft lauded the anti-terror agreements reached at the summit .
" these treaties focus not on our differences , but on our common values , " he said .
eu commission president romano prodi underscored the importance of transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terror .
" when europe and the united states are united , no problem and no enemy can stand against us , " he said .
" if we fail to unite , every problem may become a crisis and every enemy a gigantic monster . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm food debate rears its head again genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban .

the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .
britain 's presence was longterm , the paper wrote , and that truth had to be openly expressed .
the situation in iraq has become precarious , unstable and dangerous , wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
it 's a moot point and a bit arrogant to muse now whether washington 's post-war planning was sloppy or amateurish .
given the ethnic , religious and political complexities , the paper 's editors wrote , even the most thorough planning probably could n't have prevented the chaos .
it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
kommersant in moscow likened the situations in afghanistan and iraq .
in both countries , it observed , opponents of foreign military occupation are resisting in the same way .

if this " last black hole in europe , " as the paper called it , wanted to come in , these countries would need to be ruled by law , mercilessly fight organized crime and make no exceptions for notorious war criminals .
aftenposten in norway offered praise for the belgian government 's decision to change a 10-year-old law that allowed prosecution of war crimes committed by anyone , anywhere , to apply only to belgian citizens or people living in the country .
the u.s. had put belgium under great pressure over the issue , noted the oslo paper , deploring that washington continues to deny any jurisdiction over american citizens by the international criminal court .
war criminals and others who commit excesses in war , wrote the aftenposten , have to know that they can be held accountable for their actions by the international community .
le monde in paris lauded president jacques chirac 's intention to change the constitution so that a french president can be removed from office .
the paper wrote that because there needs to be national continuity , jurists do n't want a president bothered by court proceedings , but political accountability needs to be strengthened by a proper procedure for removing a president .

the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .
britain 's presence was longterm , the paper wrote , and that truth had to be openly expressed .
the situation in iraq has become precarious , unstable and dangerous , wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
it 's a moot point and a bit arrogant to muse now whether washington 's post-war planning was sloppy or amateurish .
given the ethnic , religious and political complexities , the paper 's editors wrote , even the most thorough planning probably could n't have prevented the chaos .
it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .

german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .
his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace . on tuesday , fischer met with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo , after previously meeting with the leaders of syria and lebanon at the beginning of the week to garner arab support for peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . while in cairo , he called on the radical group hamas to implement a “ lasting ceasefire ” to help move towards implementing the road map unveiled by united states president george bush in april .
the plan foresees the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 in exchange for peaceful co-existence with israel . “ the fact that the international community - in particular the usa and europe - are so completely engaged can really add momentum towards a lasting solution to the middle east conflict between israel and it 's arab neighbors , " fischer said . however , renewed violence and a number of controversial issues threaten to derail the road map .
the plan is being shepherded by a group know as the quartet – which is made up of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia . a neutral broker although fischer downplayed expectations for his four-day visit to the troubled region , his reputation as an neutral broker had raised some hopes for a breakthrough .
he suggested the prospect of a constructive role both syria and lebanon could play in the peace process . although much of recent u.s. focus has been simply on getting israelis and palestinians talking again , both syria and lebanon are considered key to the region 's final stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah guerillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . both countries are pushing for a second road map that better addresses their demands against israel .
since fischer has already visited both syria and lebanon on three previous occasions , he would seem the perfect candidate to help cajole the countries toward peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ i know all involved from hours of private talks and telephone calls to a degree like no other current foreign minister , ” fischer recently told spiegel magazine . during his visit to the region he listed the contributions the european union had made to the peace process : " there never would have been a reform of the palestinian authority , or prime minister mahmud abbas , if the europeans had n't put in a massive effort .
we filled the gap after camp david , we developed the road map and pushed it forward via the quartet .
those are all considerable contributions . " but fischer also made clear that although europe ’ s role was “ important ” , it could be nothing more than supporting one to the united states . “ however we can help , we will , but help is all we can do .
the main players are others , ” he said . but if the united states chooses to apply pressure on israel to stick to the road map , fischer ’ s cachet with the arab world is likely to become ever more important in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer meets resistance to road map in middle east the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work .
-lrb- june 23 , 2003 -rrb- fischer pins hope on " road map " for mideast peace german foreign minister fischer wrapped up his three-day visit to the middle east on wednesday by urging palestinians to speed up reforms in order to facilitate a “ road map ” for peace in the intifada-torn region .

genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban . the transatlantic dispute over genetically-modified food flared up this week with u.s. president george w. bush accusing the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight with its obstructionist stance .
speaking at the annual conference of the biotechnology industry organization -lrb- bio -rrb- in washington on monday , bush said european governments had blocked the import of biotechnology crops " based on unfounded and unscientific fears . "
the president stressed that as a result many african nations were afraid to use gm crops for fear they would not get access to european markets .
" for the sake of a continent threatened by famine , i urge european nations to end their opposition to biotechnology , " he added .
eu officials vehemently rejected bush ’ s comments .

eu outlaws gm food the transatlantic row over genetically-modified food is not new .
the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials .
however , officials are working on a system of labeling existing gm foods so that european consumers can choose whether to buy them .
the european parliament is also due to vote on the rules next week , a move which could lead the way for the ban to be lifted .
gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
" no one really knows what the long-term impact of gm will be on our health or the environment , " spokeswoman clare oxborrow of green group friends of the earth told reuters .
" consumers in europe know this and have made it perfectly clear that they do n't want to eat gm food . "
eu ban hurting the u.s. for his part president bush has argued that the eu ban was not just hurting u.s.-produced crops , but also influencing other countries , especially in the developing world , to oppose gm crops when they could benefit immensely from them .
last year , several african countries like zambia rejected gm food aid from the u.s. despite suffering severe food shortages .
" we are not going to accept gm food until there is a world consensus on its safety for human consumption , " zambia ’ s commerce , trade and industry minister dipak patel told reuters on tuesday .
the eu ban is also having an impact on the large u.s. biotech industry .
gene-spliced crops account for 75 percent of u.s. soybeans , 71 percent of cotton and 34 percent of corn , making the u.s. the world leader in biotech crops .
the u.s. has launched a trade suit with the world trade organization to overturn the eu restrictions , which have crippled gm exports to the eu in the last five years .
u.s. corn farmers say they are losing about $ 300 million a year in sales to the eu .

genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban . the transatlantic dispute over genetically-modified food flared up this week with u.s. president george w. bush accusing the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight with its obstructionist stance .
speaking at the annual conference of the biotechnology industry organization -lrb- bio -rrb- in washington on monday , bush said european governments had blocked the import of biotechnology crops " based on unfounded and unscientific fears . "
the president stressed that as a result many african nations were afraid to use gm crops for fear they would not get access to european markets .
" for the sake of a continent threatened by famine , i urge european nations to end their opposition to biotechnology , " he added .
eu officials vehemently rejected bush ’ s comments .

genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban . the transatlantic dispute over genetically-modified food flared up this week with u.s. president george w. bush accusing the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight with its obstructionist stance .
speaking at the annual conference of the biotechnology industry organization -lrb- bio -rrb- in washington on monday , bush said european governments had blocked the import of biotechnology crops " based on unfounded and unscientific fears . "
the president stressed that as a result many african nations were afraid to use gm crops for fear they would not get access to european markets .
" for the sake of a continent threatened by famine , i urge european nations to end their opposition to biotechnology , " he added .
eu officials vehemently rejected bush ’ s comments .
" the suggestions made by the united states are simply not true , " european commission spokesman gerassimos thomas told a daily news briefing on tuesday .
" it is false that we are anti-biotechnology or anti-developing countries . "
eu outlaws gm food the transatlantic row over genetically-modified food is not new .
the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials .
however , officials are working on a system of labeling existing gm foods so that european consumers can choose whether to buy them .
the european parliament is also due to vote on the rules next week , a move which could lead the way for the ban to be lifted .
gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
" no one really knows what the long-term impact of gm will be on our health or the environment , " spokeswoman clare oxborrow of green group friends of the earth told reuters .
" consumers in europe know this and have made it perfectly clear that they do n't want to eat gm food . "
eu ban hurting the u.s. for his part president bush has argued that the eu ban was not just hurting u.s.-produced crops , but also influencing other countries , especially in the developing world , to oppose gm crops when they could benefit immensely from them .
last year , several african countries like zambia rejected gm food aid from the u.s. despite suffering severe food shortages .
" we are not going to accept gm food until there is a world consensus on its safety for human consumption , " zambia ’ s commerce , trade and industry minister dipak patel told reuters on tuesday .
the eu ban is also having an impact on the large u.s. biotech industry .
gene-spliced crops account for 75 percent of u.s. soybeans , 71 percent of cotton and 34 percent of corn , making the u.s. the world leader in biotech crops .
the u.s. has launched a trade suit with the world trade organization to overturn the eu restrictions , which have crippled gm exports to the eu in the last five years .
u.s. corn farmers say they are losing about $ 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
gm hype all hogwash ?
proponents of gm technology argue it will increase farm yields , lower costs and provide enough food for a hungry world .
but critics of gm food don ’ t buy the argument .
they accuse the u.s. president of having only the interests of powerful american biotech companies in mind and have pooh-poohed his concern over helping the developing world .
" it is nonsense , " patrick holden of environmental group soil association told reuters .
" even serious experts on gm will concede that there is no evidence that gm can make any greater contribution to feeding the world than existing agricultural science . "
while the gm food debate continues unabated back and forth across the atlantic , the latest round of bickering could hardly have come at a worse time .

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .
" in order for there to be peace in the middle east , we must see organizations such as hamas dismantled , " bush said .
u.s. sees hamas as obstacle to mideast peace the u.s. , which recently brokered a landmark agreement between palestinian and israeli leaders , has long listed hamas as a " foreign terrorist organization . "
president bush has singled it out as the biggest hurdle to a u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace and wants the eu to follow suit by outlawing the group ’ s political wing .
" the true tests for hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks , their capacity to blow up the peace process , " bush said .
he urged leaders in europe and elsewhere to " take swift , decisive action " against hamas and other groups , including cutting off funding .
but france opposes the move , insisting that hamas is a necessary player in the region ’ s peace process .
hamas ’ military wing , responsible for several suicide attacks on israel since the beginning of the three-year-old intifada , or uprising , against the occupation of palestinian territories , is already on an eu list of banned terrorist groups whose assets may be seized .
the u.s. also called on european nations to sideline palestinian president yasser arafat , whom israel and washington accuse of inciting anti-israel violence .
the controversy over genetically-modified food , which has snowballed into a major transatlantic trade dispute , also topped the agenda and officials said they saw little chance of progress .
on tuesday , president bush enraged eu officials by implying in a speech europe was indirectly contributing to famine in africa by refusing to lift its ban on gm food .
leaders intensify anti-terror cooperation but despite the differences , the summit was seen as an important opportunity for leaders to put behind their past animosity , at a time when transatlantic relations are at an historic low , and pursue common goals .
greek government spokesman christos protopapas said the europeans hoped the summit would " constitute the starting point for a new era in the strategic partnership between the united states and europe after the tension that existed in recent months . "
indeed , leaders reached deals on a series of outstanding issues on boosting anti-terror cooperation .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .
the two sides are also expected to embrace a legal assistance agreement that will allow u.s. and eu law enforcement agencies mutual access to bank accounts to trace terrorist funding .
further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .
the leaders expanded the range of offenses that qualify for extradition , and the eu , which opposes capital punishment , won the right to refuse extradition in cases where the death penalty may be imposed .
u.s. attorney general john ashcroft lauded the anti-terror agreements reached at the summit .
" these treaties focus not on our differences , but on our common values , " he said .
eu commission president romano prodi underscored the importance of transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terror .

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .
" in order for there to be peace in the middle east , we must see organizations such as hamas dismantled , " bush said .
u.s. sees hamas as obstacle to mideast peace the u.s. , which recently brokered a landmark agreement between palestinian and israeli leaders , has long listed hamas as a " foreign terrorist organization . "
president bush has singled it out as the biggest hurdle to a u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace and wants the eu to follow suit by outlawing the group ’ s political wing .
" the true tests for hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks , their capacity to blow up the peace process , " bush said .
he urged leaders in europe and elsewhere to " take swift , decisive action " against hamas and other groups , including cutting off funding .
but france opposes the move , insisting that hamas is a necessary player in the region ’ s peace process .
hamas ’ military wing , responsible for several suicide attacks on israel since the beginning of the three-year-old intifada , or uprising , against the occupation of palestinian territories , is already on an eu list of banned terrorist groups whose assets may be seized .
the u.s. also called on european nations to sideline palestinian president yasser arafat , whom israel and washington accuse of inciting anti-israel violence .
the controversy over genetically-modified food , which has snowballed into a major transatlantic trade dispute , also topped the agenda and officials said they saw little chance of progress .
on tuesday , president bush enraged eu officials by implying in a speech europe was indirectly contributing to famine in africa by refusing to lift its ban on gm food .
leaders intensify anti-terror cooperation but despite the differences , the summit was seen as an important opportunity for leaders to put behind their past animosity , at a time when transatlantic relations are at an historic low , and pursue common goals .
greek government spokesman christos protopapas said the europeans hoped the summit would " constitute the starting point for a new era in the strategic partnership between the united states and europe after the tension that existed in recent months . "
indeed , leaders reached deals on a series of outstanding issues on boosting anti-terror cooperation .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .
the two sides are also expected to embrace a legal assistance agreement that will allow u.s. and eu law enforcement agencies mutual access to bank accounts to trace terrorist funding .
further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .
the leaders expanded the range of offenses that qualify for extradition , and the eu , which opposes capital punishment , won the right to refuse extradition in cases where the death penalty may be imposed .
u.s. attorney general john ashcroft lauded the anti-terror agreements reached at the summit .
" these treaties focus not on our differences , but on our common values , " he said .
eu commission president romano prodi underscored the importance of transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terror .

genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban . the transatlantic dispute over genetically-modified food flared up this week with u.s. president george w. bush accusing the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight with its obstructionist stance .
speaking at the annual conference of the biotechnology industry organization -lrb- bio -rrb- in washington on monday , bush said european governments had blocked the import of biotechnology crops " based on unfounded and unscientific fears . "
the president stressed that as a result many african nations were afraid to use gm crops for fear they would not get access to european markets .
" for the sake of a continent threatened by famine , i urge european nations to end their opposition to biotechnology , " he added .
eu officials vehemently rejected bush ’ s comments .
" the suggestions made by the united states are simply not true , " european commission spokesman gerassimos thomas told a daily news briefing on tuesday .
" it is false that we are anti-biotechnology or anti-developing countries . "
eu outlaws gm food the transatlantic row over genetically-modified food is not new .
the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials .
however , officials are working on a system of labeling existing gm foods so that european consumers can choose whether to buy them .
the european parliament is also due to vote on the rules next week , a move which could lead the way for the ban to be lifted .
gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
" no one really knows what the long-term impact of gm will be on our health or the environment , " spokeswoman clare oxborrow of green group friends of the earth told reuters .
" consumers in europe know this and have made it perfectly clear that they do n't want to eat gm food . "
eu ban hurting the u.s. for his part president bush has argued that the eu ban was not just hurting u.s.-produced crops , but also influencing other countries , especially in the developing world , to oppose gm crops when they could benefit immensely from them .
last year , several african countries like zambia rejected gm food aid from the u.s. despite suffering severe food shortages .
" we are not going to accept gm food until there is a world consensus on its safety for human consumption , " zambia ’ s commerce , trade and industry minister dipak patel told reuters on tuesday .
the eu ban is also having an impact on the large u.s. biotech industry .
gene-spliced crops account for 75 percent of u.s. soybeans , 71 percent of cotton and 34 percent of corn , making the u.s. the world leader in biotech crops .
the u.s. has launched a trade suit with the world trade organization to overturn the eu restrictions , which have crippled gm exports to the eu in the last five years .
u.s. corn farmers say they are losing about $ 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
gm hype all hogwash ?
proponents of gm technology argue it will increase farm yields , lower costs and provide enough food for a hungry world .
but critics of gm food don ’ t buy the argument .
they accuse the u.s. president of having only the interests of powerful american biotech companies in mind and have pooh-poohed his concern over helping the developing world .
" it is nonsense , " patrick holden of environmental group soil association told reuters .
" even serious experts on gm will concede that there is no evidence that gm can make any greater contribution to feeding the world than existing agricultural science . "
while the gm food debate continues unabated back and forth across the atlantic , the latest round of bickering could hardly have come at a worse time .

gm hype all hogwash ?
proponents of gm technology argue it will increase farm yields , lower costs and provide enough food for a hungry world .
but critics of gm food don ’ t buy the argument .
they accuse the u.s. president of having only the interests of powerful american biotech companies in mind and have pooh-poohed his concern over helping the developing world .
" it is nonsense , " patrick holden of environmental group soil association told reuters .
" even serious experts on gm will concede that there is no evidence that gm can make any greater contribution to feeding the world than existing agricultural science . "
while the gm food debate continues unabated back and forth across the atlantic , the latest round of bickering could hardly have come at a worse time .

german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .
his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace . on tuesday , fischer met with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo , after previously meeting with the leaders of syria and lebanon at the beginning of the week to garner arab support for peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . while in cairo , he called on the radical group hamas to implement a “ lasting ceasefire ” to help move towards implementing the road map unveiled by united states president george bush in april .
the plan foresees the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 in exchange for peaceful co-existence with israel . “ the fact that the international community - in particular the usa and europe - are so completely engaged can really add momentum towards a lasting solution to the middle east conflict between israel and it 's arab neighbors , " fischer said . however , renewed violence and a number of controversial issues threaten to derail the road map .
the plan is being shepherded by a group know as the quartet – which is made up of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia . a neutral broker although fischer downplayed expectations for his four-day visit to the troubled region , his reputation as an neutral broker had raised some hopes for a breakthrough .
he suggested the prospect of a constructive role both syria and lebanon could play in the peace process . although much of recent u.s. focus has been simply on getting israelis and palestinians talking again , both syria and lebanon are considered key to the region 's final stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah guerillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . both countries are pushing for a second road map that better addresses their demands against israel .
since fischer has already visited both syria and lebanon on three previous occasions , he would seem the perfect candidate to help cajole the countries toward peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ i know all involved from hours of private talks and telephone calls to a degree like no other current foreign minister , ” fischer recently told spiegel magazine . during his visit to the region he listed the contributions the european union had made to the peace process : " there never would have been a reform of the palestinian authority , or prime minister mahmud abbas , if the europeans had n't put in a massive effort .
we filled the gap after camp david , we developed the road map and pushed it forward via the quartet .
those are all considerable contributions . " but fischer also made clear that although europe ’ s role was “ important ” , it could be nothing more than supporting one to the united states . “ however we can help , we will , but help is all we can do .
the main players are others , ” he said . but if the united states chooses to apply pressure on israel to stick to the road map , fischer ’ s cachet with the arab world is likely to become ever more important in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer meets resistance to road map in middle east the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work .

the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .
britain 's presence was longterm , the paper wrote , and that truth had to be openly expressed .
the situation in iraq has become precarious , unstable and dangerous , wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
it 's a moot point and a bit arrogant to muse now whether washington 's post-war planning was sloppy or amateurish .
given the ethnic , religious and political complexities , the paper 's editors wrote , even the most thorough planning probably could n't have prevented the chaos .
it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
kommersant in moscow likened the situations in afghanistan and iraq .
in both countries , it observed , opponents of foreign military occupation are resisting in the same way .
like a phoenix from the ashes , taliban leader mullah omar is calling for holy war in afghanistan , while in iraq the coalition troops are having to mount a large operation to extinguish pockets of resistance that are growing by the day .
de morgen in belgium wrote that it could see the seed of one of the biggest trade crises ever between the european union and the united states in genetically changed foods .
enormous interests are at stake , the brussels paper wrote , with american maize growers saying they lose $ 300 million a year because of a european import ban on genetically modified maize .
the kronenzeitung in austria criticized israeli settlement policy .
before the country is ultimately split and borders are negotiated , it says , prime minister ariel sharon is having the lines drawn to meet his strategic needs , the aim being to incorporate in israel as many settlements on arab soil as possible .
el país in madrid wrote that it saw mismanagement , radical nationalism , corruption and crime flourishing in albania , bosnia , croatia , macedonia and serbia-montenegro , which have been promised eu membership .
if this " last black hole in europe , " as the paper called it , wanted to come in , these countries would need to be ruled by law , mercilessly fight organized crime and make no exceptions for notorious war criminals .
aftenposten in norway offered praise for the belgian government 's decision to change a 10-year-old law that allowed prosecution of war crimes committed by anyone , anywhere , to apply only to belgian citizens or people living in the country .
the u.s. had put belgium under great pressure over the issue , noted the oslo paper , deploring that washington continues to deny any jurisdiction over american citizens by the international criminal court .
war criminals and others who commit excesses in war , wrote the aftenposten , have to know that they can be held accountable for their actions by the international community .
le monde in paris lauded president jacques chirac 's intention to change the constitution so that a french president can be removed from office .
the paper wrote that because there needs to be national continuity , jurists do n't want a president bothered by court proceedings , but political accountability needs to be strengthened by a proper procedure for removing a president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2003 european press review : tony under pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles have long since disappeared for tony blair 's iraq mission .
the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .
britain 's presence was longterm , the paper wrote , and that truth had to be openly expressed .
the situation in iraq has become precarious , unstable and dangerous , wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
it 's a moot point and a bit arrogant to muse now whether washington 's post-war planning was sloppy or amateurish .
given the ethnic , religious and political complexities , the paper 's editors wrote , even the most thorough planning probably could n't have prevented the chaos .
it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
kommersant in moscow likened the situations in afghanistan and iraq .
in both countries , it observed , opponents of foreign military occupation are resisting in the same way .
like a phoenix from the ashes , taliban leader mullah omar is calling for holy war in afghanistan , while in iraq the coalition troops are having to mount a large operation to extinguish pockets of resistance that are growing by the day .
de morgen in belgium wrote that it could see the seed of one of the biggest trade crises ever between the european union and the united states in genetically changed foods .
enormous interests are at stake , the brussels paper wrote , with american maize growers saying they lose $ 300 million a year because of a european import ban on genetically modified maize .
the kronenzeitung in austria criticized israeli settlement policy .
before the country is ultimately split and borders are negotiated , it says , prime minister ariel sharon is having the lines drawn to meet his strategic needs , the aim being to incorporate in israel as many settlements on arab soil as possible .
el país in madrid wrote that it saw mismanagement , radical nationalism , corruption and crime flourishing in albania , bosnia , croatia , macedonia and serbia-montenegro , which have been promised eu membership .
if this " last black hole in europe , " as the paper called it , wanted to come in , these countries would need to be ruled by law , mercilessly fight organized crime and make no exceptions for notorious war criminals .
aftenposten in norway offered praise for the belgian government 's decision to change a 10-year-old law that allowed prosecution of war crimes committed by anyone , anywhere , to apply only to belgian citizens or people living in the country .
the u.s. had put belgium under great pressure over the issue , noted the oslo paper , deploring that washington continues to deny any jurisdiction over american citizens by the international criminal court .
war criminals and others who commit excesses in war , wrote the aftenposten , have to know that they can be held accountable for their actions by the international community .
le monde in paris lauded president jacques chirac 's intention to change the constitution so that a french president can be removed from office .
the paper wrote that because there needs to be national continuity , jurists do n't want a president bothered by court proceedings , but political accountability needs to be strengthened by a proper procedure for removing a president .

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .
" in order for there to be peace in the middle east , we must see organizations such as hamas dismantled , " bush said .
u.s. sees hamas as obstacle to mideast peace the u.s. , which recently brokered a landmark agreement between palestinian and israeli leaders , has long listed hamas as a " foreign terrorist organization . "
president bush has singled it out as the biggest hurdle to a u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace and wants the eu to follow suit by outlawing the group ’ s political wing .
" the true tests for hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks , their capacity to blow up the peace process , " bush said .
he urged leaders in europe and elsewhere to " take swift , decisive action " against hamas and other groups , including cutting off funding .
but france opposes the move , insisting that hamas is a necessary player in the region ’ s peace process .
hamas ’ military wing , responsible for several suicide attacks on israel since the beginning of the three-year-old intifada , or uprising , against the occupation of palestinian territories , is already on an eu list of banned terrorist groups whose assets may be seized .
the u.s. also called on european nations to sideline palestinian president yasser arafat , whom israel and washington accuse of inciting anti-israel violence .
the controversy over genetically-modified food , which has snowballed into a major transatlantic trade dispute , also topped the agenda and officials said they saw little chance of progress .
on tuesday , president bush enraged eu officials by implying in a speech europe was indirectly contributing to famine in africa by refusing to lift its ban on gm food .
leaders intensify anti-terror cooperation but despite the differences , the summit was seen as an important opportunity for leaders to put behind their past animosity , at a time when transatlantic relations are at an historic low , and pursue common goals .
greek government spokesman christos protopapas said the europeans hoped the summit would " constitute the starting point for a new era in the strategic partnership between the united states and europe after the tension that existed in recent months . "
indeed , leaders reached deals on a series of outstanding issues on boosting anti-terror cooperation .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .
the two sides are also expected to embrace a legal assistance agreement that will allow u.s. and eu law enforcement agencies mutual access to bank accounts to trace terrorist funding .
further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .
the leaders expanded the range of offenses that qualify for extradition , and the eu , which opposes capital punishment , won the right to refuse extradition in cases where the death penalty may be imposed .
u.s. attorney general john ashcroft lauded the anti-terror agreements reached at the summit .
" these treaties focus not on our differences , but on our common values , " he said .
eu commission president romano prodi underscored the importance of transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terror .

german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .
his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace . on tuesday , fischer met with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo , after previously meeting with the leaders of syria and lebanon at the beginning of the week to garner arab support for peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . while in cairo , he called on the radical group hamas to implement a “ lasting ceasefire ” to help move towards implementing the road map unveiled by united states president george bush in april .
the plan foresees the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 in exchange for peaceful co-existence with israel . “ the fact that the international community - in particular the usa and europe - are so completely engaged can really add momentum towards a lasting solution to the middle east conflict between israel and it 's arab neighbors , " fischer said . however , renewed violence and a number of controversial issues threaten to derail the road map .
the plan is being shepherded by a group know as the quartet – which is made up of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia . a neutral broker although fischer downplayed expectations for his four-day visit to the troubled region , his reputation as an neutral broker had raised some hopes for a breakthrough .
he suggested the prospect of a constructive role both syria and lebanon could play in the peace process . although much of recent u.s. focus has been simply on getting israelis and palestinians talking again , both syria and lebanon are considered key to the region 's final stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah guerillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . both countries are pushing for a second road map that better addresses their demands against israel .
since fischer has already visited both syria and lebanon on three previous occasions , he would seem the perfect candidate to help cajole the countries toward peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ i know all involved from hours of private talks and telephone calls to a degree like no other current foreign minister , ” fischer recently told spiegel magazine . during his visit to the region he listed the contributions the european union had made to the peace process : " there never would have been a reform of the palestinian authority , or prime minister mahmud abbas , if the europeans had n't put in a massive effort .
we filled the gap after camp david , we developed the road map and pushed it forward via the quartet .
those are all considerable contributions . " but fischer also made clear that although europe ’ s role was “ important ” , it could be nothing more than supporting one to the united states . “ however we can help , we will , but help is all we can do .
the main players are others , ” he said . but if the united states chooses to apply pressure on israel to stick to the road map , fischer ’ s cachet with the arab world is likely to become ever more important in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer meets resistance to road map in middle east the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work .

the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .
britain 's presence was longterm , the paper wrote , and that truth had to be openly expressed .
the situation in iraq has become precarious , unstable and dangerous , wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
it 's a moot point and a bit arrogant to muse now whether washington 's post-war planning was sloppy or amateurish .
given the ethnic , religious and political complexities , the paper 's editors wrote , even the most thorough planning probably could n't have prevented the chaos .
it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
kommersant in moscow likened the situations in afghanistan and iraq .
in both countries , it observed , opponents of foreign military occupation are resisting in the same way .
like a phoenix from the ashes , taliban leader mullah omar is calling for holy war in afghanistan , while in iraq the coalition troops are having to mount a large operation to extinguish pockets of resistance that are growing by the day .
de morgen in belgium wrote that it could see the seed of one of the biggest trade crises ever between the european union and the united states in genetically changed foods .
enormous interests are at stake , the brussels paper wrote , with american maize growers saying they lose $ 300 million a year because of a european import ban on genetically modified maize .
the kronenzeitung in austria criticized israeli settlement policy .
before the country is ultimately split and borders are negotiated , it says , prime minister ariel sharon is having the lines drawn to meet his strategic needs , the aim being to incorporate in israel as many settlements on arab soil as possible .
el país in madrid wrote that it saw mismanagement , radical nationalism , corruption and crime flourishing in albania , bosnia , croatia , macedonia and serbia-montenegro , which have been promised eu membership .
if this " last black hole in europe , " as the paper called it , wanted to come in , these countries would need to be ruled by law , mercilessly fight organized crime and make no exceptions for notorious war criminals .
aftenposten in norway offered praise for the belgian government 's decision to change a 10-year-old law that allowed prosecution of war crimes committed by anyone , anywhere , to apply only to belgian citizens or people living in the country .
the u.s. had put belgium under great pressure over the issue , noted the oslo paper , deploring that washington continues to deny any jurisdiction over american citizens by the international criminal court .
war criminals and others who commit excesses in war , wrote the aftenposten , have to know that they can be held accountable for their actions by the international community .
le monde in paris lauded president jacques chirac 's intention to change the constitution so that a french president can be removed from office .
the paper wrote that because there needs to be national continuity , jurists do n't want a president bothered by court proceedings , but political accountability needs to be strengthened by a proper procedure for removing a president .
doubtlessly , it added , chirac 's initiative will bring clarification and modernization to a decisive element of the constitution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .
his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace . on tuesday , fischer met with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo , after previously meeting with the leaders of syria and lebanon at the beginning of the week to garner arab support for peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . while in cairo , he called on the radical group hamas to implement a “ lasting ceasefire ” to help move towards implementing the road map unveiled by united states president george bush in april .
the plan foresees the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 in exchange for peaceful co-existence with israel . “ the fact that the international community - in particular the usa and europe - are so completely engaged can really add momentum towards a lasting solution to the middle east conflict between israel and it 's arab neighbors , " fischer said . however , renewed violence and a number of controversial issues threaten to derail the road map .
the plan is being shepherded by a group know as the quartet – which is made up of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia . a neutral broker although fischer downplayed expectations for his four-day visit to the troubled region , his reputation as an neutral broker had raised some hopes for a breakthrough .
he suggested the prospect of a constructive role both syria and lebanon could play in the peace process . although much of recent u.s. focus has been simply on getting israelis and palestinians talking again , both syria and lebanon are considered key to the region 's final stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah guerillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . both countries are pushing for a second road map that better addresses their demands against israel .
since fischer has already visited both syria and lebanon on three previous occasions , he would seem the perfect candidate to help cajole the countries toward peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ i know all involved from hours of private talks and telephone calls to a degree like no other current foreign minister , ” fischer recently told spiegel magazine . during his visit to the region he listed the contributions the european union had made to the peace process : " there never would have been a reform of the palestinian authority , or prime minister mahmud abbas , if the europeans had n't put in a massive effort .
we filled the gap after camp david , we developed the road map and pushed it forward via the quartet .
those are all considerable contributions . " but fischer also made clear that although europe ’ s role was “ important ” , it could be nothing more than supporting one to the united states . “ however we can help , we will , but help is all we can do .
the main players are others , ” he said . but if the united states chooses to apply pressure on israel to stick to the road map , fischer ’ s cachet with the arab world is likely to become ever more important in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer meets resistance to road map in middle east the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work .
-lrb- june 23 , 2003 -rrb- fischer pins hope on " road map " for mideast peace german foreign minister fischer wrapped up his three-day visit to the middle east on wednesday by urging palestinians to speed up reforms in order to facilitate a “ road map ” for peace in the intifada-torn region .

genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban . the transatlantic dispute over genetically-modified food flared up this week with u.s. president george w. bush accusing the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight with its obstructionist stance .
speaking at the annual conference of the biotechnology industry organization -lrb- bio -rrb- in washington on monday , bush said european governments had blocked the import of biotechnology crops " based on unfounded and unscientific fears . "
the president stressed that as a result many african nations were afraid to use gm crops for fear they would not get access to european markets .
" for the sake of a continent threatened by famine , i urge european nations to end their opposition to biotechnology , " he added .
eu officials vehemently rejected bush ’ s comments .
" the suggestions made by the united states are simply not true , " european commission spokesman gerassimos thomas told a daily news briefing on tuesday .
" it is false that we are anti-biotechnology or anti-developing countries . "
eu outlaws gm food the transatlantic row over genetically-modified food is not new .
the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials .
however , officials are working on a system of labeling existing gm foods so that european consumers can choose whether to buy them .
the european parliament is also due to vote on the rules next week , a move which could lead the way for the ban to be lifted .
gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
" no one really knows what the long-term impact of gm will be on our health or the environment , " spokeswoman clare oxborrow of green group friends of the earth told reuters .
" consumers in europe know this and have made it perfectly clear that they do n't want to eat gm food . "
eu ban hurting the u.s. for his part president bush has argued that the eu ban was not just hurting u.s.-produced crops , but also influencing other countries , especially in the developing world , to oppose gm crops when they could benefit immensely from them .
last year , several african countries like zambia rejected gm food aid from the u.s. despite suffering severe food shortages .
" we are not going to accept gm food until there is a world consensus on its safety for human consumption , " zambia ’ s commerce , trade and industry minister dipak patel told reuters on tuesday .
the eu ban is also having an impact on the large u.s. biotech industry .
gene-spliced crops account for 75 percent of u.s. soybeans , 71 percent of cotton and 34 percent of corn , making the u.s. the world leader in biotech crops .
the u.s. has launched a trade suit with the world trade organization to overturn the eu restrictions , which have crippled gm exports to the eu in the last five years .
u.s. corn farmers say they are losing about $ 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
gm hype all hogwash ?
proponents of gm technology argue it will increase farm yields , lower costs and provide enough food for a hungry world .
but critics of gm food don ’ t buy the argument .
they accuse the u.s. president of having only the interests of powerful american biotech companies in mind and have pooh-poohed his concern over helping the developing world .
" it is nonsense , " patrick holden of environmental group soil association told reuters .
" even serious experts on gm will concede that there is no evidence that gm can make any greater contribution to feeding the world than existing agricultural science . "
while the gm food debate continues unabated back and forth across the atlantic , the latest round of bickering could hardly have come at a worse time .

german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .
his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace . on tuesday , fischer met with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo , after previously meeting with the leaders of syria and lebanon at the beginning of the week to garner arab support for peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . while in cairo , he called on the radical group hamas to implement a “ lasting ceasefire ” to help move towards implementing the road map unveiled by united states president george bush in april .
the plan foresees the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 in exchange for peaceful co-existence with israel . “ the fact that the international community - in particular the usa and europe - are so completely engaged can really add momentum towards a lasting solution to the middle east conflict between israel and it 's arab neighbors , " fischer said . however , renewed violence and a number of controversial issues threaten to derail the road map .
the plan is being shepherded by a group know as the quartet – which is made up of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia . a neutral broker although fischer downplayed expectations for his four-day visit to the troubled region , his reputation as an neutral broker had raised some hopes for a breakthrough .
he suggested the prospect of a constructive role both syria and lebanon could play in the peace process . although much of recent u.s. focus has been simply on getting israelis and palestinians talking again , both syria and lebanon are considered key to the region 's final stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah guerillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . both countries are pushing for a second road map that better addresses their demands against israel .
since fischer has already visited both syria and lebanon on three previous occasions , he would seem the perfect candidate to help cajole the countries toward peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ i know all involved from hours of private talks and telephone calls to a degree like no other current foreign minister , ” fischer recently told spiegel magazine . during his visit to the region he listed the contributions the european union had made to the peace process : " there never would have been a reform of the palestinian authority , or prime minister mahmud abbas , if the europeans had n't put in a massive effort .
we filled the gap after camp david , we developed the road map and pushed it forward via the quartet .
those are all considerable contributions . " but fischer also made clear that although europe ’ s role was “ important ” , it could be nothing more than supporting one to the united states . “ however we can help , we will , but help is all we can do .
the main players are others , ” he said . but if the united states chooses to apply pressure on israel to stick to the road map , fischer ’ s cachet with the arab world is likely to become ever more important in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer meets resistance to road map in middle east the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work .

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .
" in order for there to be peace in the middle east , we must see organizations such as hamas dismantled , " bush said .
u.s. sees hamas as obstacle to mideast peace the u.s. , which recently brokered a landmark agreement between palestinian and israeli leaders , has long listed hamas as a " foreign terrorist organization . "
president bush has singled it out as the biggest hurdle to a u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace and wants the eu to follow suit by outlawing the group ’ s political wing .
" the true tests for hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks , their capacity to blow up the peace process , " bush said .
he urged leaders in europe and elsewhere to " take swift , decisive action " against hamas and other groups , including cutting off funding .
but france opposes the move , insisting that hamas is a necessary player in the region ’ s peace process .
hamas ’ military wing , responsible for several suicide attacks on israel since the beginning of the three-year-old intifada , or uprising , against the occupation of palestinian territories , is already on an eu list of banned terrorist groups whose assets may be seized .
the u.s. also called on european nations to sideline palestinian president yasser arafat , whom israel and washington accuse of inciting anti-israel violence .
the controversy over genetically-modified food , which has snowballed into a major transatlantic trade dispute , also topped the agenda and officials said they saw little chance of progress .
on tuesday , president bush enraged eu officials by implying in a speech europe was indirectly contributing to famine in africa by refusing to lift its ban on gm food .
leaders intensify anti-terror cooperation but despite the differences , the summit was seen as an important opportunity for leaders to put behind their past animosity , at a time when transatlantic relations are at an historic low , and pursue common goals .
greek government spokesman christos protopapas said the europeans hoped the summit would " constitute the starting point for a new era in the strategic partnership between the united states and europe after the tension that existed in recent months . "
indeed , leaders reached deals on a series of outstanding issues on boosting anti-terror cooperation .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .
the two sides are also expected to embrace a legal assistance agreement that will allow u.s. and eu law enforcement agencies mutual access to bank accounts to trace terrorist funding .
further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .
the leaders expanded the range of offenses that qualify for extradition , and the eu , which opposes capital punishment , won the right to refuse extradition in cases where the death penalty may be imposed .
u.s. attorney general john ashcroft lauded the anti-terror agreements reached at the summit .
" these treaties focus not on our differences , but on our common values , " he said .
eu commission president romano prodi underscored the importance of transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terror .
" when europe and the united states are united , no problem and no enemy can stand against us , " he said .
" if we fail to unite , every problem may become a crisis and every enemy a gigantic monster . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm food debate rears its head again genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban .

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .
" in order for there to be peace in the middle east , we must see organizations such as hamas dismantled , " bush said .
u.s. sees hamas as obstacle to mideast peace the u.s. , which recently brokered a landmark agreement between palestinian and israeli leaders , has long listed hamas as a " foreign terrorist organization . "
president bush has singled it out as the biggest hurdle to a u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace and wants the eu to follow suit by outlawing the group ’ s political wing .
" the true tests for hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks , their capacity to blow up the peace process , " bush said .
he urged leaders in europe and elsewhere to " take swift , decisive action " against hamas and other groups , including cutting off funding .
but france opposes the move , insisting that hamas is a necessary player in the region ’ s peace process .
hamas ’ military wing , responsible for several suicide attacks on israel since the beginning of the three-year-old intifada , or uprising , against the occupation of palestinian territories , is already on an eu list of banned terrorist groups whose assets may be seized .
the u.s. also called on european nations to sideline palestinian president yasser arafat , whom israel and washington accuse of inciting anti-israel violence .
the controversy over genetically-modified food , which has snowballed into a major transatlantic trade dispute , also topped the agenda and officials said they saw little chance of progress .
on tuesday , president bush enraged eu officials by implying in a speech europe was indirectly contributing to famine in africa by refusing to lift its ban on gm food .
leaders intensify anti-terror cooperation but despite the differences , the summit was seen as an important opportunity for leaders to put behind their past animosity , at a time when transatlantic relations are at an historic low , and pursue common goals .
greek government spokesman christos protopapas said the europeans hoped the summit would " constitute the starting point for a new era in the strategic partnership between the united states and europe after the tension that existed in recent months . "
indeed , leaders reached deals on a series of outstanding issues on boosting anti-terror cooperation .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .
the two sides are also expected to embrace a legal assistance agreement that will allow u.s. and eu law enforcement agencies mutual access to bank accounts to trace terrorist funding .
further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .
the leaders expanded the range of offenses that qualify for extradition , and the eu , which opposes capital punishment , won the right to refuse extradition in cases where the death penalty may be imposed .
u.s. attorney general john ashcroft lauded the anti-terror agreements reached at the summit .
" these treaties focus not on our differences , but on our common values , " he said .
eu commission president romano prodi underscored the importance of transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terror .
" when europe and the united states are united , no problem and no enemy can stand against us , " he said .

the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .

it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 25.06.2003 germany 's fischer returns from mideast peace tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer met egyptian president hosni mubarak , as well as the leaders of syria and lebanon .
german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .
his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace . on tuesday , fischer met with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo , after previously meeting with the leaders of syria and lebanon at the beginning of the week to garner arab support for peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . while in cairo , he called on the radical group hamas to implement a “ lasting ceasefire ” to help move towards implementing the road map unveiled by united states president george bush in april .
the plan foresees the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 in exchange for peaceful co-existence with israel . “ the fact that the international community - in particular the usa and europe - are so completely engaged can really add momentum towards a lasting solution to the middle east conflict between israel and it 's arab neighbors , " fischer said . however , renewed violence and a number of controversial issues threaten to derail the road map .
the plan is being shepherded by a group know as the quartet – which is made up of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia . a neutral broker although fischer downplayed expectations for his four-day visit to the troubled region , his reputation as an neutral broker had raised some hopes for a breakthrough .
he suggested the prospect of a constructive role both syria and lebanon could play in the peace process . although much of recent u.s. focus has been simply on getting israelis and palestinians talking again , both syria and lebanon are considered key to the region 's final stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .

the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .
britain 's presence was longterm , the paper wrote , and that truth had to be openly expressed .
the situation in iraq has become precarious , unstable and dangerous , wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
it 's a moot point and a bit arrogant to muse now whether washington 's post-war planning was sloppy or amateurish .
given the ethnic , religious and political complexities , the paper 's editors wrote , even the most thorough planning probably could n't have prevented the chaos .
it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
kommersant in moscow likened the situations in afghanistan and iraq .
in both countries , it observed , opponents of foreign military occupation are resisting in the same way .
like a phoenix from the ashes , taliban leader mullah omar is calling for holy war in afghanistan , while in iraq the coalition troops are having to mount a large operation to extinguish pockets of resistance that are growing by the day .
de morgen in belgium wrote that it could see the seed of one of the biggest trade crises ever between the european union and the united states in genetically changed foods .
enormous interests are at stake , the brussels paper wrote , with american maize growers saying they lose $ 300 million a year because of a european import ban on genetically modified maize .
the kronenzeitung in austria criticized israeli settlement policy .
before the country is ultimately split and borders are negotiated , it says , prime minister ariel sharon is having the lines drawn to meet his strategic needs , the aim being to incorporate in israel as many settlements on arab soil as possible .
el país in madrid wrote that it saw mismanagement , radical nationalism , corruption and crime flourishing in albania , bosnia , croatia , macedonia and serbia-montenegro , which have been promised eu membership .
if this " last black hole in europe , " as the paper called it , wanted to come in , these countries would need to be ruled by law , mercilessly fight organized crime and make no exceptions for notorious war criminals .
aftenposten in norway offered praise for the belgian government 's decision to change a 10-year-old law that allowed prosecution of war crimes committed by anyone , anywhere , to apply only to belgian citizens or people living in the country .
the u.s. had put belgium under great pressure over the issue , noted the oslo paper , deploring that washington continues to deny any jurisdiction over american citizens by the international criminal court .
war criminals and others who commit excesses in war , wrote the aftenposten , have to know that they can be held accountable for their actions by the international community .
le monde in paris lauded president jacques chirac 's intention to change the constitution so that a french president can be removed from office .
the paper wrote that because there needs to be national continuity , jurists do n't want a president bothered by court proceedings , but political accountability needs to be strengthened by a proper procedure for removing a president .
doubtlessly , it added , chirac 's initiative will bring clarification and modernization to a decisive element of the constitution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2003 gm food debate rears its head again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corn out of the laboratory : fit to eat ?
genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban . the transatlantic dispute over genetically-modified food flared up this week with u.s. president george w. bush accusing the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight with its obstructionist stance .
speaking at the annual conference of the biotechnology industry organization -lrb- bio -rrb- in washington on monday , bush said european governments had blocked the import of biotechnology crops " based on unfounded and unscientific fears . "
the president stressed that as a result many african nations were afraid to use gm crops for fear they would not get access to european markets .
" for the sake of a continent threatened by famine , i urge european nations to end their opposition to biotechnology , " he added .
eu officials vehemently rejected bush ’ s comments .
" the suggestions made by the united states are simply not true , " european commission spokesman gerassimos thomas told a daily news briefing on tuesday .
" it is false that we are anti-biotechnology or anti-developing countries . "
eu outlaws gm food the transatlantic row over genetically-modified food is not new .
the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials .
however , officials are working on a system of labeling existing gm foods so that european consumers can choose whether to buy them .
the european parliament is also due to vote on the rules next week , a move which could lead the way for the ban to be lifted .
gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
" no one really knows what the long-term impact of gm will be on our health or the environment , " spokeswoman clare oxborrow of green group friends of the earth told reuters .
" consumers in europe know this and have made it perfectly clear that they do n't want to eat gm food . "
eu ban hurting the u.s. for his part president bush has argued that the eu ban was not just hurting u.s.-produced crops , but also influencing other countries , especially in the developing world , to oppose gm crops when they could benefit immensely from them .
last year , several african countries like zambia rejected gm food aid from the u.s. despite suffering severe food shortages .
" we are not going to accept gm food until there is a world consensus on its safety for human consumption , " zambia ’ s commerce , trade and industry minister dipak patel told reuters on tuesday .
the eu ban is also having an impact on the large u.s. biotech industry .
gene-spliced crops account for 75 percent of u.s. soybeans , 71 percent of cotton and 34 percent of corn , making the u.s. the world leader in biotech crops .
the u.s. has launched a trade suit with the world trade organization to overturn the eu restrictions , which have crippled gm exports to the eu in the last five years .
u.s. corn farmers say they are losing about $ 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
gm hype all hogwash ?
proponents of gm technology argue it will increase farm yields , lower costs and provide enough food for a hungry world .
but critics of gm food don ’ t buy the argument .
they accuse the u.s. president of having only the interests of powerful american biotech companies in mind and have pooh-poohed his concern over helping the developing world .
" it is nonsense , " patrick holden of environmental group soil association told reuters .
" even serious experts on gm will concede that there is no evidence that gm can make any greater contribution to feeding the world than existing agricultural science . "
while the gm food debate continues unabated back and forth across the atlantic , the latest round of bickering could hardly have come at a worse time .

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .
" in order for there to be peace in the middle east , we must see organizations such as hamas dismantled , " bush said .
u.s. sees hamas as obstacle to mideast peace the u.s. , which recently brokered a landmark agreement between palestinian and israeli leaders , has long listed hamas as a " foreign terrorist organization . "
president bush has singled it out as the biggest hurdle to a u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace and wants the eu to follow suit by outlawing the group ’ s political wing .
" the true tests for hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks , their capacity to blow up the peace process , " bush said .
he urged leaders in europe and elsewhere to " take swift , decisive action " against hamas and other groups , including cutting off funding .
but france opposes the move , insisting that hamas is a necessary player in the region ’ s peace process .
hamas ’ military wing , responsible for several suicide attacks on israel since the beginning of the three-year-old intifada , or uprising , against the occupation of palestinian territories , is already on an eu list of banned terrorist groups whose assets may be seized .
the u.s. also called on european nations to sideline palestinian president yasser arafat , whom israel and washington accuse of inciting anti-israel violence .
the controversy over genetically-modified food , which has snowballed into a major transatlantic trade dispute , also topped the agenda and officials said they saw little chance of progress .
on tuesday , president bush enraged eu officials by implying in a speech europe was indirectly contributing to famine in africa by refusing to lift its ban on gm food .
leaders intensify anti-terror cooperation but despite the differences , the summit was seen as an important opportunity for leaders to put behind their past animosity , at a time when transatlantic relations are at an historic low , and pursue common goals .
greek government spokesman christos protopapas said the europeans hoped the summit would " constitute the starting point for a new era in the strategic partnership between the united states and europe after the tension that existed in recent months . "
indeed , leaders reached deals on a series of outstanding issues on boosting anti-terror cooperation .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .
the two sides are also expected to embrace a legal assistance agreement that will allow u.s. and eu law enforcement agencies mutual access to bank accounts to trace terrorist funding .
further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .
the leaders expanded the range of offenses that qualify for extradition , and the eu , which opposes capital punishment , won the right to refuse extradition in cases where the death penalty may be imposed .

the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials .
however , officials are working on a system of labeling existing gm foods so that european consumers can choose whether to buy them .
the european parliament is also due to vote on the rules next week , a move which could lead the way for the ban to be lifted .
gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
" no one really knows what the long-term impact of gm will be on our health or the environment , " spokeswoman clare oxborrow of green group friends of the earth told reuters .
" consumers in europe know this and have made it perfectly clear that they do n't want to eat gm food . "
eu ban hurting the u.s. for his part president bush has argued that the eu ban was not just hurting u.s.-produced crops , but also influencing other countries , especially in the developing world , to oppose gm crops when they could benefit immensely from them .
last year , several african countries like zambia rejected gm food aid from the u.s. despite suffering severe food shortages .
" we are not going to accept gm food until there is a world consensus on its safety for human consumption , " zambia ’ s commerce , trade and industry minister dipak patel told reuters on tuesday .
the eu ban is also having an impact on the large u.s. biotech industry .
gene-spliced crops account for 75 percent of u.s. soybeans , 71 percent of cotton and 34 percent of corn , making the u.s. the world leader in biotech crops .
the u.s. has launched a trade suit with the world trade organization to overturn the eu restrictions , which have crippled gm exports to the eu in the last five years .
u.s. corn farmers say they are losing about $ 300 million a year in sales to the eu .

genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban . the transatlantic dispute over genetically-modified food flared up this week with u.s. president george w. bush accusing the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight with its obstructionist stance .
speaking at the annual conference of the biotechnology industry organization -lrb- bio -rrb- in washington on monday , bush said european governments had blocked the import of biotechnology crops " based on unfounded and unscientific fears . "
the president stressed that as a result many african nations were afraid to use gm crops for fear they would not get access to european markets .
" for the sake of a continent threatened by famine , i urge european nations to end their opposition to biotechnology , " he added .
eu officials vehemently rejected bush ’ s comments .
" the suggestions made by the united states are simply not true , " european commission spokesman gerassimos thomas told a daily news briefing on tuesday .

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .
" in order for there to be peace in the middle east , we must see organizations such as hamas dismantled , " bush said .
u.s. sees hamas as obstacle to mideast peace the u.s. , which recently brokered a landmark agreement between palestinian and israeli leaders , has long listed hamas as a " foreign terrorist organization . "
president bush has singled it out as the biggest hurdle to a u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace and wants the eu to follow suit by outlawing the group ’ s political wing .
" the true tests for hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks , their capacity to blow up the peace process , " bush said .
he urged leaders in europe and elsewhere to " take swift , decisive action " against hamas and other groups , including cutting off funding .
but france opposes the move , insisting that hamas is a necessary player in the region ’ s peace process .
hamas ’ military wing , responsible for several suicide attacks on israel since the beginning of the three-year-old intifada , or uprising , against the occupation of palestinian territories , is already on an eu list of banned terrorist groups whose assets may be seized .
the u.s. also called on european nations to sideline palestinian president yasser arafat , whom israel and washington accuse of inciting anti-israel violence .
the controversy over genetically-modified food , which has snowballed into a major transatlantic trade dispute , also topped the agenda and officials said they saw little chance of progress .
on tuesday , president bush enraged eu officials by implying in a speech europe was indirectly contributing to famine in africa by refusing to lift its ban on gm food .
leaders intensify anti-terror cooperation but despite the differences , the summit was seen as an important opportunity for leaders to put behind their past animosity , at a time when transatlantic relations are at an historic low , and pursue common goals .
greek government spokesman christos protopapas said the europeans hoped the summit would " constitute the starting point for a new era in the strategic partnership between the united states and europe after the tension that existed in recent months . "
indeed , leaders reached deals on a series of outstanding issues on boosting anti-terror cooperation .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .
the two sides are also expected to embrace a legal assistance agreement that will allow u.s. and eu law enforcement agencies mutual access to bank accounts to trace terrorist funding .
further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .
the leaders expanded the range of offenses that qualify for extradition , and the eu , which opposes capital punishment , won the right to refuse extradition in cases where the death penalty may be imposed .
u.s. attorney general john ashcroft lauded the anti-terror agreements reached at the summit .
" these treaties focus not on our differences , but on our common values , " he said .
eu commission president romano prodi underscored the importance of transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terror .
" when europe and the united states are united , no problem and no enemy can stand against us , " he said .
" if we fail to unite , every problem may become a crisis and every enemy a gigantic monster . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm food debate rears its head again genetically-modified food – good or bad ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2003 european press review : tony under pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles have long since disappeared for tony blair 's iraq mission .
the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .
britain 's presence was longterm , the paper wrote , and that truth had to be openly expressed .
the situation in iraq has become precarious , unstable and dangerous , wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
it 's a moot point and a bit arrogant to muse now whether washington 's post-war planning was sloppy or amateurish .
given the ethnic , religious and political complexities , the paper 's editors wrote , even the most thorough planning probably could n't have prevented the chaos .
it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
kommersant in moscow likened the situations in afghanistan and iraq .
in both countries , it observed , opponents of foreign military occupation are resisting in the same way .
like a phoenix from the ashes , taliban leader mullah omar is calling for holy war in afghanistan , while in iraq the coalition troops are having to mount a large operation to extinguish pockets of resistance that are growing by the day .
de morgen in belgium wrote that it could see the seed of one of the biggest trade crises ever between the european union and the united states in genetically changed foods .
enormous interests are at stake , the brussels paper wrote , with american maize growers saying they lose $ 300 million a year because of a european import ban on genetically modified maize .
the kronenzeitung in austria criticized israeli settlement policy .
before the country is ultimately split and borders are negotiated , it says , prime minister ariel sharon is having the lines drawn to meet his strategic needs , the aim being to incorporate in israel as many settlements on arab soil as possible .
el país in madrid wrote that it saw mismanagement , radical nationalism , corruption and crime flourishing in albania , bosnia , croatia , macedonia and serbia-montenegro , which have been promised eu membership .
if this " last black hole in europe , " as the paper called it , wanted to come in , these countries would need to be ruled by law , mercilessly fight organized crime and make no exceptions for notorious war criminals .
aftenposten in norway offered praise for the belgian government 's decision to change a 10-year-old law that allowed prosecution of war crimes committed by anyone , anywhere , to apply only to belgian citizens or people living in the country .
the u.s. had put belgium under great pressure over the issue , noted the oslo paper , deploring that washington continues to deny any jurisdiction over american citizens by the international criminal court .
war criminals and others who commit excesses in war , wrote the aftenposten , have to know that they can be held accountable for their actions by the international community .
le monde in paris lauded president jacques chirac 's intention to change the constitution so that a french president can be removed from office .
the paper wrote that because there needs to be national continuity , jurists do n't want a president bothered by court proceedings , but political accountability needs to be strengthened by a proper procedure for removing a president .
doubtlessly , it added , chirac 's initiative will bring clarification and modernization to a decisive element of the constitution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .
" in order for there to be peace in the middle east , we must see organizations such as hamas dismantled , " bush said .
u.s. sees hamas as obstacle to mideast peace the u.s. , which recently brokered a landmark agreement between palestinian and israeli leaders , has long listed hamas as a " foreign terrorist organization . "
president bush has singled it out as the biggest hurdle to a u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace and wants the eu to follow suit by outlawing the group ’ s political wing .
" the true tests for hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks , their capacity to blow up the peace process , " bush said .
he urged leaders in europe and elsewhere to " take swift , decisive action " against hamas and other groups , including cutting off funding .
but france opposes the move , insisting that hamas is a necessary player in the region ’ s peace process .
hamas ’ military wing , responsible for several suicide attacks on israel since the beginning of the three-year-old intifada , or uprising , against the occupation of palestinian territories , is already on an eu list of banned terrorist groups whose assets may be seized .
the u.s. also called on european nations to sideline palestinian president yasser arafat , whom israel and washington accuse of inciting anti-israel violence .
the controversy over genetically-modified food , which has snowballed into a major transatlantic trade dispute , also topped the agenda and officials said they saw little chance of progress .
on tuesday , president bush enraged eu officials by implying in a speech europe was indirectly contributing to famine in africa by refusing to lift its ban on gm food .
leaders intensify anti-terror cooperation but despite the differences , the summit was seen as an important opportunity for leaders to put behind their past animosity , at a time when transatlantic relations are at an historic low , and pursue common goals .
greek government spokesman christos protopapas said the europeans hoped the summit would " constitute the starting point for a new era in the strategic partnership between the united states and europe after the tension that existed in recent months . "
indeed , leaders reached deals on a series of outstanding issues on boosting anti-terror cooperation .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .
the two sides are also expected to embrace a legal assistance agreement that will allow u.s. and eu law enforcement agencies mutual access to bank accounts to trace terrorist funding .
further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .
the leaders expanded the range of offenses that qualify for extradition , and the eu , which opposes capital punishment , won the right to refuse extradition in cases where the death penalty may be imposed .
u.s. attorney general john ashcroft lauded the anti-terror agreements reached at the summit .
" these treaties focus not on our differences , but on our common values , " he said .
eu commission president romano prodi underscored the importance of transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terror .
" when europe and the united states are united , no problem and no enemy can stand against us , " he said .
" if we fail to unite , every problem may become a crisis and every enemy a gigantic monster . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm food debate rears its head again genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban .

german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .
his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace . on tuesday , fischer met with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo , after previously meeting with the leaders of syria and lebanon at the beginning of the week to garner arab support for peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . while in cairo , he called on the radical group hamas to implement a “ lasting ceasefire ” to help move towards implementing the road map unveiled by united states president george bush in april .
the plan foresees the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 in exchange for peaceful co-existence with israel . “ the fact that the international community - in particular the usa and europe - are so completely engaged can really add momentum towards a lasting solution to the middle east conflict between israel and it 's arab neighbors , " fischer said . however , renewed violence and a number of controversial issues threaten to derail the road map .
the plan is being shepherded by a group know as the quartet – which is made up of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia . a neutral broker although fischer downplayed expectations for his four-day visit to the troubled region , his reputation as an neutral broker had raised some hopes for a breakthrough .
he suggested the prospect of a constructive role both syria and lebanon could play in the peace process . although much of recent u.s. focus has been simply on getting israelis and palestinians talking again , both syria and lebanon are considered key to the region 's final stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah guerillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . both countries are pushing for a second road map that better addresses their demands against israel .
since fischer has already visited both syria and lebanon on three previous occasions , he would seem the perfect candidate to help cajole the countries toward peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ i know all involved from hours of private talks and telephone calls to a degree like no other current foreign minister , ” fischer recently told spiegel magazine . during his visit to the region he listed the contributions the european union had made to the peace process : " there never would have been a reform of the palestinian authority , or prime minister mahmud abbas , if the europeans had n't put in a massive effort .
we filled the gap after camp david , we developed the road map and pushed it forward via the quartet .
those are all considerable contributions . " but fischer also made clear that although europe ’ s role was “ important ” , it could be nothing more than supporting one to the united states . “ however we can help , we will , but help is all we can do .
the main players are others , ” he said . but if the united states chooses to apply pressure on israel to stick to the road map , fischer ’ s cachet with the arab world is likely to become ever more important in the coming months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer meets resistance to road map in middle east the german foreign minister , on a middle east tour pushing the road map for peace , has run into criticism from syria and lebanon who say a peace plan for israel and the palestinians has to include them or it wo n't work .

the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .
britain 's presence was longterm , the paper wrote , and that truth had to be openly expressed .
the situation in iraq has become precarious , unstable and dangerous , wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
it 's a moot point and a bit arrogant to muse now whether washington 's post-war planning was sloppy or amateurish .
given the ethnic , religious and political complexities , the paper 's editors wrote , even the most thorough planning probably could n't have prevented the chaos .
it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
kommersant in moscow likened the situations in afghanistan and iraq .
in both countries , it observed , opponents of foreign military occupation are resisting in the same way .
like a phoenix from the ashes , taliban leader mullah omar is calling for holy war in afghanistan , while in iraq the coalition troops are having to mount a large operation to extinguish pockets of resistance that are growing by the day .
de morgen in belgium wrote that it could see the seed of one of the biggest trade crises ever between the european union and the united states in genetically changed foods .
enormous interests are at stake , the brussels paper wrote , with american maize growers saying they lose $ 300 million a year because of a european import ban on genetically modified maize .
the kronenzeitung in austria criticized israeli settlement policy .
before the country is ultimately split and borders are negotiated , it says , prime minister ariel sharon is having the lines drawn to meet his strategic needs , the aim being to incorporate in israel as many settlements on arab soil as possible .
el país in madrid wrote that it saw mismanagement , radical nationalism , corruption and crime flourishing in albania , bosnia , croatia , macedonia and serbia-montenegro , which have been promised eu membership .
if this " last black hole in europe , " as the paper called it , wanted to come in , these countries would need to be ruled by law , mercilessly fight organized crime and make no exceptions for notorious war criminals .
aftenposten in norway offered praise for the belgian government 's decision to change a 10-year-old law that allowed prosecution of war crimes committed by anyone , anywhere , to apply only to belgian citizens or people living in the country .
the u.s. had put belgium under great pressure over the issue , noted the oslo paper , deploring that washington continues to deny any jurisdiction over american citizens by the international criminal court .
war criminals and others who commit excesses in war , wrote the aftenposten , have to know that they can be held accountable for their actions by the international community .
le monde in paris lauded president jacques chirac 's intention to change the constitution so that a french president can be removed from office .
the paper wrote that because there needs to be national continuity , jurists do n't want a president bothered by court proceedings , but political accountability needs to be strengthened by a proper procedure for removing a president .

the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .
britain 's presence was longterm , the paper wrote , and that truth had to be openly expressed .
the situation in iraq has become precarious , unstable and dangerous , wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
it 's a moot point and a bit arrogant to muse now whether washington 's post-war planning was sloppy or amateurish .
given the ethnic , religious and political complexities , the paper 's editors wrote , even the most thorough planning probably could n't have prevented the chaos .
it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .

aftenposten in norway offered praise for the belgian government 's decision to change a 10-year-old law that allowed prosecution of war crimes committed by anyone , anywhere , to apply only to belgian citizens or people living in the country .
the u.s. had put belgium under great pressure over the issue , noted the oslo paper , deploring that washington continues to deny any jurisdiction over american citizens by the international criminal court .
war criminals and others who commit excesses in war , wrote the aftenposten , have to know that they can be held accountable for their actions by the international community .
le monde in paris lauded president jacques chirac 's intention to change the constitution so that a french president can be removed from office .
the paper wrote that because there needs to be national continuity , jurists do n't want a president bothered by court proceedings , but political accountability needs to be strengthened by a proper procedure for removing a president .

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .
" in order for there to be peace in the middle east , we must see organizations such as hamas dismantled , " bush said .
u.s. sees hamas as obstacle to mideast peace the u.s. , which recently brokered a landmark agreement between palestinian and israeli leaders , has long listed hamas as a " foreign terrorist organization . "
president bush has singled it out as the biggest hurdle to a u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace and wants the eu to follow suit by outlawing the group ’ s political wing .
" the true tests for hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks , their capacity to blow up the peace process , " bush said .
he urged leaders in europe and elsewhere to " take swift , decisive action " against hamas and other groups , including cutting off funding .
but france opposes the move , insisting that hamas is a necessary player in the region ’ s peace process .
hamas ’ military wing , responsible for several suicide attacks on israel since the beginning of the three-year-old intifada , or uprising , against the occupation of palestinian territories , is already on an eu list of banned terrorist groups whose assets may be seized .
the u.s. also called on european nations to sideline palestinian president yasser arafat , whom israel and washington accuse of inciting anti-israel violence .
the controversy over genetically-modified food , which has snowballed into a major transatlantic trade dispute , also topped the agenda and officials said they saw little chance of progress .
on tuesday , president bush enraged eu officials by implying in a speech europe was indirectly contributing to famine in africa by refusing to lift its ban on gm food .
leaders intensify anti-terror cooperation but despite the differences , the summit was seen as an important opportunity for leaders to put behind their past animosity , at a time when transatlantic relations are at an historic low , and pursue common goals .
greek government spokesman christos protopapas said the europeans hoped the summit would " constitute the starting point for a new era in the strategic partnership between the united states and europe after the tension that existed in recent months . "
indeed , leaders reached deals on a series of outstanding issues on boosting anti-terror cooperation .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .
the two sides are also expected to embrace a legal assistance agreement that will allow u.s. and eu law enforcement agencies mutual access to bank accounts to trace terrorist funding .
further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .
the leaders expanded the range of offenses that qualify for extradition , and the eu , which opposes capital punishment , won the right to refuse extradition in cases where the death penalty may be imposed .
u.s. attorney general john ashcroft lauded the anti-terror agreements reached at the summit .
" these treaties focus not on our differences , but on our common values , " he said .
eu commission president romano prodi underscored the importance of transatlantic cooperation in the fight against terror .
" when europe and the united states are united , no problem and no enemy can stand against us , " he said .
" if we fail to unite , every problem may become a crisis and every enemy a gigantic monster . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm food debate rears its head again genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban .

white house spokesman ari fleischer said eu and u.s. leaders would issue joint statements calling for a " comprehensive air services agreement " aimed at opening u.s.-european aviation markets .

further accords include an agreement on container security that would give u.s. officials based in european ports the right to check shipping containers headed for the u.s. fleischer said the two sides also decided to strengthen export controls aimed to counter illicit trade in suspected weapons of mass destruction .

a one-day transatlantic summit in washington meant to smooth over iraq-war tensions saw leaders making progress on anti-terror cooperation - even as the u.s. urged europe to cut off funding to hamas . a fence-mending meeting aimed to bring eu and u.s. leaders closer together after the recent acrimony over the iraq war in washington on wednesday dealt with a host of pressing transatlantic issues .
but given u.s. president george w. bush ’ s bruising comments over the eu ’ s ban on genetically-modified food on the eve of the summit , the mood was n't exactly reconciliatory .
instead , president bush impressed upon a high-level eu delegation that european nations should cut off all funding for the palestinian militant group hamas .
bush made the appeal directly to romano prodi , president of the european commission , and greek prime minister costas simitis , whose country holds the current eu presidency .
" in order for there to be peace in the middle east , we must see organizations such as hamas dismantled , " bush said .
u.s. sees hamas as obstacle to mideast peace the u.s. , which recently brokered a landmark agreement between palestinian and israeli leaders , has long listed hamas as a " foreign terrorist organization . "
president bush has singled it out as the biggest hurdle to a u.s. and eu-backed " road map " to peace and wants the eu to follow suit by outlawing the group ’ s political wing .
" the true tests for hamas and terrorist organizations is the complete dismantlement of their terrorist networks , their capacity to blow up the peace process , " bush said .
he urged leaders in europe and elsewhere to " take swift , decisive action " against hamas and other groups , including cutting off funding .
but france opposes the move , insisting that hamas is a necessary player in the region ’ s peace process .

genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban . the transatlantic dispute over genetically-modified food flared up this week with u.s. president george w. bush accusing the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight with its obstructionist stance .
speaking at the annual conference of the biotechnology industry organization -lrb- bio -rrb- in washington on monday , bush said european governments had blocked the import of biotechnology crops " based on unfounded and unscientific fears . "
the president stressed that as a result many african nations were afraid to use gm crops for fear they would not get access to european markets .
" for the sake of a continent threatened by famine , i urge european nations to end their opposition to biotechnology , " he added .
eu officials vehemently rejected bush ’ s comments .
" the suggestions made by the united states are simply not true , " european commission spokesman gerassimos thomas told a daily news briefing on tuesday .
" it is false that we are anti-biotechnology or anti-developing countries . "
eu outlaws gm food the transatlantic row over genetically-modified food is not new .
the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials .
however , officials are working on a system of labeling existing gm foods so that european consumers can choose whether to buy them .
the european parliament is also due to vote on the rules next week , a move which could lead the way for the ban to be lifted .
gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
" no one really knows what the long-term impact of gm will be on our health or the environment , " spokeswoman clare oxborrow of green group friends of the earth told reuters .
" consumers in europe know this and have made it perfectly clear that they do n't want to eat gm food . "
eu ban hurting the u.s. for his part president bush has argued that the eu ban was not just hurting u.s.-produced crops , but also influencing other countries , especially in the developing world , to oppose gm crops when they could benefit immensely from them .
last year , several african countries like zambia rejected gm food aid from the u.s. despite suffering severe food shortages .
" we are not going to accept gm food until there is a world consensus on its safety for human consumption , " zambia ’ s commerce , trade and industry minister dipak patel told reuters on tuesday .
the eu ban is also having an impact on the large u.s. biotech industry .
gene-spliced crops account for 75 percent of u.s. soybeans , 71 percent of cotton and 34 percent of corn , making the u.s. the world leader in biotech crops .
the u.s. has launched a trade suit with the world trade organization to overturn the eu restrictions , which have crippled gm exports to the eu in the last five years .
u.s. corn farmers say they are losing about $ 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
gm hype all hogwash ?
proponents of gm technology argue it will increase farm yields , lower costs and provide enough food for a hungry world .
but critics of gm food don ’ t buy the argument .
they accuse the u.s. president of having only the interests of powerful american biotech companies in mind and have pooh-poohed his concern over helping the developing world .
" it is nonsense , " patrick holden of environmental group soil association told reuters .
" even serious experts on gm will concede that there is no evidence that gm can make any greater contribution to feeding the world than existing agricultural science . "
while the gm food debate continues unabated back and forth across the atlantic , the latest round of bickering could hardly have come at a worse time .

the president stressed that as a result many african nations were afraid to use gm crops for fear they would not get access to european markets .
" for the sake of a continent threatened by famine , i urge european nations to end their opposition to biotechnology , " he added .
eu officials vehemently rejected bush ’ s comments .
" the suggestions made by the united states are simply not true , " european commission spokesman gerassimos thomas told a daily news briefing on tuesday .
" it is false that we are anti-biotechnology or anti-developing countries . "
eu outlaws gm food the transatlantic row over genetically-modified food is not new .
the eu imposed a moratorium on the farming and import of gm foods and grains in 1998 due to safety concerns .
except for the import of approved strains of gm corn and soybeans for use in food products , eu states banned most gm crops .
it has also restricted gm field trials .
however , officials are working on a system of labeling existing gm foods so that european consumers can choose whether to buy them .
the european parliament is also due to vote on the rules next week , a move which could lead the way for the ban to be lifted .
gm technology is generally viewed with skepticism in europe and numerous surveys show that health and environmentally-conscious consumers tend to question the food on their plate before swallowing it .
european environmentalists have repeatedly voiced concern about the health risks and the threat to the environment and say not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
" no one really knows what the long-term impact of gm will be on our health or the environment , " spokeswoman clare oxborrow of green group friends of the earth told reuters .
" consumers in europe know this and have made it perfectly clear that they do n't want to eat gm food . "
eu ban hurting the u.s. for his part president bush has argued that the eu ban was not just hurting u.s.-produced crops , but also influencing other countries , especially in the developing world , to oppose gm crops when they could benefit immensely from them .
last year , several african countries like zambia rejected gm food aid from the u.s. despite suffering severe food shortages .
" we are not going to accept gm food until there is a world consensus on its safety for human consumption , " zambia ’ s commerce , trade and industry minister dipak patel told reuters on tuesday .
the eu ban is also having an impact on the large u.s. biotech industry .
gene-spliced crops account for 75 percent of u.s. soybeans , 71 percent of cotton and 34 percent of corn , making the u.s. the world leader in biotech crops .
the u.s. has launched a trade suit with the world trade organization to overturn the eu restrictions , which have crippled gm exports to the eu in the last five years .
u.s. corn farmers say they are losing about $ 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
gm hype all hogwash ?
proponents of gm technology argue it will increase farm yields , lower costs and provide enough food for a hungry world .
but critics of gm food don ’ t buy the argument .
they accuse the u.s. president of having only the interests of powerful american biotech companies in mind and have pooh-poohed his concern over helping the developing world .
" it is nonsense , " patrick holden of environmental group soil association told reuters .
" even serious experts on gm will concede that there is no evidence that gm can make any greater contribution to feeding the world than existing agricultural science . "
while the gm food debate continues unabated back and forth across the atlantic , the latest round of bickering could hardly have come at a worse time .

german foreign minister joschka fischer returned home from a whirlwind tour of the middle east late tuesday .
his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace . on tuesday , fischer met with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo , after previously meeting with the leaders of syria and lebanon at the beginning of the week to garner arab support for peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . while in cairo , he called on the radical group hamas to implement a “ lasting ceasefire ” to help move towards implementing the road map unveiled by united states president george bush in april .
the plan foresees the creation of a palestinian state by 2005 in exchange for peaceful co-existence with israel . “ the fact that the international community - in particular the usa and europe - are so completely engaged can really add momentum towards a lasting solution to the middle east conflict between israel and it 's arab neighbors , " fischer said . however , renewed violence and a number of controversial issues threaten to derail the road map .
the plan is being shepherded by a group know as the quartet – which is made up of the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia . a neutral broker although fischer downplayed expectations for his four-day visit to the troubled region , his reputation as an neutral broker had raised some hopes for a breakthrough .
he suggested the prospect of a constructive role both syria and lebanon could play in the peace process . although much of recent u.s. focus has been simply on getting israelis and palestinians talking again , both syria and lebanon are considered key to the region 's final stability .
syria has been demanding the return of the golan heights which israel captured from it in 1967 .
lebanon is the home of hizbollah guerillas who helped drive israel out of south lebanon three years ago and who the u.s. considers a terrorist group . both countries are pushing for a second road map that better addresses their demands against israel .
since fischer has already visited both syria and lebanon on three previous occasions , he would seem the perfect candidate to help cajole the countries toward peace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ i know all involved from hours of private talks and telephone calls to a degree like no other current foreign minister , ” fischer recently told spiegel magazine . during his visit to the region he listed the contributions the european union had made to the peace process : " there never would have been a reform of the palestinian authority , or prime minister mahmud abbas , if the europeans had n't put in a massive effort .
we filled the gap after camp david , we developed the road map and pushed it forward via the quartet .
those are all considerable contributions . " but fischer also made clear that although europe ’ s role was “ important ” , it could be nothing more than supporting one to the united states . “ however we can help , we will , but help is all we can do .

his trip to region helped underline key eu support for the so-called “ road map ” for peace . on tuesday , fischer met with egyptian president hosni mubarak in cairo , after previously meeting with the leaders of syria and lebanon at the beginning of the week to garner arab support for peace efforts between israel and the palestinians . while in cairo , he called on the radical group hamas to implement a “ lasting ceasefire ” to help move towards implementing the road map unveiled by united states president george bush in april .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.06.2003 european press review : tony under pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smiles have long since disappeared for tony blair 's iraq mission .
the killings of six soldiers in iraq have put increased pressure on british prime minister tony blair .
at least one european newspaper editorial said it could be the last straw for blair and dampen any reelection effort . the headlines in britain 's the guardian seemed to say it all on wednesday .
" death and chaos in iraq , " read one .
" our soldiers should not pay the price , " said another .
" in the end , " the paper 's editors wrote , " the british forces , like those of the u.s. , remain an occupying army whether or not they are wearing their helmets : their position is compromised by the chaotic administration imposed by washington 's envoys .
" president bush 's obsession with catching saddam , " the guardian continued " is not a solution . "
instead , the paper called for a coherent plan to hand back control of the country to the iraqis rather than the limping measures taken so far .
the editors of the times of london argued that prime minister tony blair will have to explain his iraq policy following the deaths of six british soldiers and the wounding of eight others on tuesday .
it showed that the relative popularity of the british forces did n't protect them from being targets of politically motivated attacks .
britain 's presence was longterm , the paper wrote , and that truth had to be openly expressed .
the situation in iraq has become precarious , unstable and dangerous , wrote germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
it 's a moot point and a bit arrogant to muse now whether washington 's post-war planning was sloppy or amateurish .
given the ethnic , religious and political complexities , the paper 's editors wrote , even the most thorough planning probably could n't have prevented the chaos .
it 's obvious that even the bush administration needs partners , the paper added , before noting that in hardly coded words the secretary-general of nato is recommending that it get a role .
meanwhile italy 's la repubblica wrote that it saw tony blair under similar pressure that befell maggie thatcher .
the editors of the rome-based paper wrote that blair 's labor party has thrown most of the blame directly at him and that almost half of the party 's parliamentarians have never agree with his pro-washington attitude .
now , the paper concluded , they no longer think blair can win elections .
russia 's nesavissimaya gazeta took a look at russian president vladmir putin 's visit to britain in the context of blair 's iraq problems .
it 's unpleasant for blair , the moscow paper observed , that the visit at the invitation of queen elizabeth and the parliamentary inquiry over the arguments for going to war have come at the same time .
now , blair has to put a brave face on it , and putin has to show him sympathy .
le soir in brussels opined wednesday that iraqi oil could cloud london 's relationship with moscow .
during their meeting , blair and putin are sure to talk about the delicate issue of oil contracts in iran , the paper wrote , recalling that at their last joint press conference , putin openly made fun of blair and his inability to deliver proof that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction .
kommersant in moscow likened the situations in afghanistan and iraq .
in both countries , it observed , opponents of foreign military occupation are resisting in the same way .
like a phoenix from the ashes , taliban leader mullah omar is calling for holy war in afghanistan , while in iraq the coalition troops are having to mount a large operation to extinguish pockets of resistance that are growing by the day .
de morgen in belgium wrote that it could see the seed of one of the biggest trade crises ever between the european union and the united states in genetically changed foods .
enormous interests are at stake , the brussels paper wrote , with american maize growers saying they lose $ 300 million a year because of a european import ban on genetically modified maize .
the kronenzeitung in austria criticized israeli settlement policy .
before the country is ultimately split and borders are negotiated , it says , prime minister ariel sharon is having the lines drawn to meet his strategic needs , the aim being to incorporate in israel as many settlements on arab soil as possible .
el país in madrid wrote that it saw mismanagement , radical nationalism , corruption and crime flourishing in albania , bosnia , croatia , macedonia and serbia-montenegro , which have been promised eu membership .
if this " last black hole in europe , " as the paper called it , wanted to come in , these countries would need to be ruled by law , mercilessly fight organized crime and make no exceptions for notorious war criminals .
aftenposten in norway offered praise for the belgian government 's decision to change a 10-year-old law that allowed prosecution of war crimes committed by anyone , anywhere , to apply only to belgian citizens or people living in the country .
the u.s. had put belgium under great pressure over the issue , noted the oslo paper , deploring that washington continues to deny any jurisdiction over american citizens by the international criminal court .
war criminals and others who commit excesses in war , wrote the aftenposten , have to know that they can be held accountable for their actions by the international community .
le monde in paris lauded president jacques chirac 's intention to change the constitution so that a french president can be removed from office .
the paper wrote that because there needs to be national continuity , jurists do n't want a president bothered by court proceedings , but political accountability needs to be strengthened by a proper procedure for removing a president .
doubtlessly , it added , chirac 's initiative will bring clarification and modernization to a decisive element of the constitution . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

seeking permission to challenge the conviction , his lawyers argued in the court of appeal that his old bailey trial in 2002 was unfair because of the " unprecedented " restrictions imposed on him by the trial judge at the behest of the prosecution .
geoffrey robertson qc said the trial was conducted in breach of mr shayler 's right to a fair hearing under common law and under the european convention on human rights .
the 37-year-old from middlesbrough , was jailed for six months in november 2002 for revealing intelligence service information to a newspaper .
he insisted that he was not a traitor , had not endangered the lives of intelligence agents and was motivated by a desire to expose abuses of power by the intelligence services .
he was released under licence after serving seven weeks .
mr robertson said mr shayler suffered discrimination after choosing to defend himself at the trial rather than being represented by counsel .
' cloak of secrecy ' trial judge , mr justice moses required him to disclose in advance the questions he planned to ask prosecution witnesses in cross-examination .
mr shayler was denied the right to question the creditworthiness of the five witnesses , four of whom remained anonymous under a " cloak of secrecy " at the behest of the home secretary , said mr robertson .
the judge had access to " secret schedules " , partly prejudicial to mr shayler , which he was not permitted to challenge .
the crown admitted that most of those restrictions would not have been sought if mr shayler had been represented by counsel .
yet there was no suggestion that mr shayler planned to " blurt out " sensitive information during the trial , said mr robertson .
mr shayler was robbed of his ancient right to defend himself in court without his statements being " vetted " in advance by prosecutor and judge .
lord justice kennedy , mr justice cresswell and mr justice bennett reserved judgment to a later date .

seeking permission to challenge the conviction , his lawyers argued in the court of appeal that his old bailey trial in 2002 was unfair because of the " unprecedented " restrictions imposed on him by the trial judge at the behest of the prosecution .
geoffrey robertson qc said the trial was conducted in breach of mr shayler 's right to a fair hearing under common law and under the european convention on human rights .
the 37-year-old from middlesbrough , was jailed for six months in november 2002 for revealing intelligence service information to a newspaper .
he insisted that he was not a traitor , had not endangered the lives of intelligence agents and was motivated by a desire to expose abuses of power by the intelligence services .
he was released under licence after serving seven weeks .
mr robertson said mr shayler suffered discrimination after choosing to defend himself at the trial rather than being represented by counsel .
' cloak of secrecy ' trial judge , mr justice moses required him to disclose in advance the questions he planned to ask prosecution witnesses in cross-examination .
mr shayler was denied the right to question the creditworthiness of the five witnesses , four of whom remained anonymous under a " cloak of secrecy " at the behest of the home secretary , said mr robertson .
the judge had access to " secret schedules " , partly prejudicial to mr shayler , which he was not permitted to challenge .
the crown admitted that most of those restrictions would not have been sought if mr shayler had been represented by counsel .
yet there was no suggestion that mr shayler planned to " blurt out " sensitive information during the trial , said mr robertson .
mr shayler was robbed of his ancient right to defend himself in court without his statements being " vetted " in advance by prosecutor and judge .
lord justice kennedy , mr justice cresswell and mr justice bennett reserved judgment to a later date .

he insisted that he was not a traitor , had not endangered the lives of intelligence agents and was motivated by a desire to expose abuses of power by the intelligence services .
he was released under licence after serving seven weeks .
mr robertson said mr shayler suffered discrimination after choosing to defend himself at the trial rather than being represented by counsel .
' cloak of secrecy ' trial judge , mr justice moses required him to disclose in advance the questions he planned to ask prosecution witnesses in cross-examination .
mr shayler was denied the right to question the creditworthiness of the five witnesses , four of whom remained anonymous under a " cloak of secrecy " at the behest of the home secretary , said mr robertson .
the judge had access to " secret schedules " , partly prejudicial to mr shayler , which he was not permitted to challenge .
the crown admitted that most of those restrictions would not have been sought if mr shayler had been represented by counsel .
yet there was no suggestion that mr shayler planned to " blurt out " sensitive information during the trial , said mr robertson .
mr shayler was robbed of his ancient right to defend himself in court without his statements being " vetted " in advance by prosecutor and judge .
lord justice kennedy , mr justice cresswell and mr justice bennett reserved judgment to a later date .

bruce treloar , the trading standards institute 's senior officer on the holiday and travel industry , offers some advice . "
no more holiday nightmares ... you must be kidding ! !
from brochures to websites , from tour operators to no-frills airlines , from agents to tv , and from pricing to insurance , the consumer has never had it so bad .
let us take you on a journey of holiday selection , holiday booking , parting with your money , enjoying the break - and then returning , hopefully with little or no complaint !
-lrb- unlikely with a 12 % increase last year ... and that 's only concerning pricing ! -rrb- .
bait and trap consumers looking for a bargain late break are still unsure whether it is legal for travel agents to keep those special offers in their windows for long periods of time .
well , unless they are still available at the advertised price , it is illegal . "
never be seduced by cheap holiday offers before checking the extras you 'll have to pay " bruce treloar if we get complaints we can prosecute travel agents for advertising outdated offers , or if the holiday is only being made available at a higher price .
so , point number one : be careful of the ' bait and trap ' scenario .
you can be drawn into a shop or website by an advertised cheap offer , ' the bait ' , only to find yourself ' trapped ' when you are offered the same holiday but at a higher price .
what about holiday brochures ?
the first point to make is that whether they are traditional holiday brochures or websites , the same rules apply .
they must show prices and these must be accurate - the same goes for descriptions .
watch the price fluid or flexible pricing is a huge issue , which consumers are often unaware of until they are charged more than the brochure price .
some operators love to put a price in a brochure and then when demand is high they increase it .
when demand is low they then make a big thing about discounts .
this is known as fluid pricing - and it is illegal .
consumers tell us they still want to sit with their families and view a selection of brochures and compare prices , but this can be impossible because the prices are often changing .
also , we 've found consumers are seduced by the claim from some operators that they can guarantee all prices in the brochure will be discounted .
in our view this makes some prices artificially high and inaccurate .
extra charges for the infamous " insurance and security " levies are another way of illegally increasing the price of holidays .
if the price in the brochure says £ 200 it should mean that , not £ 200 plus a levy of £ 12 .
' seduction ' techniques so , point two : never be seduced by cheap holiday offers before checking the extras you 'll have to pay and if you do n't like it , complain to trading standards . "
always shop around for travel insurance - and make sure you understand the policy 's exclusions " so , you 've chosen the holiday .
do you need travel insurance ?
in our view you do .
but travel insurance from tour operators and agents is often much more expensive , so resist the hard sell on insurance from travel agents or tour operators .
travel insurance can be bought from websites , from supermarkets and from a range of other household names , so it 's worth looking around .
it is important to check the small print .
we have found some insurers refusing to cover consumers from catching sars or even for the increased risks during the iraq conflict .
now we do have sympathy with the latter , but if the consumer booked before the epidemic and there is cover in the policy then consumers should be protected .
so , point three : always shop around for travel insurance - and make sure you understand the policy 's exclusions for medical cover , for example .
booking on the internet so , what 's the fuss about ' no-frills ' airlines ?
no-frills is just what it says : no in-flight meals and no transfers when you arrive at the airport , which may not be in a central location .
the flights can be cheap , but you must book early to get the best price .
no-frills airlines have provided consumers with real choice .
they 've certainly made the big airlines sit up , i think , and this is excellent news for the consumer .
what we do n't like is the problems which occur when you buy directly over the internet .
if you are a consumer you are not protected if the airline goes bust - you will have no way of changing the flight or getting your money back .
unfortunately , the law says you are not required to hold a consumer protection licence , such as an " atol " , if you sell scheduled or no-frills flights over the net .
we are trying to get the law changed , so that all companies have some form of licensing to protect the customer .
another practice , which is equally confusing , is where a flight is bought on one screen and a link is offered to another screen to buy hotels or car hire .
the law protects consumers in package deals of this nature but the no-frills airlines often insist the consumer pays separately , and this means there is no protection if you buy through a linked website deal .
the problem is that people assume they are buying a packaged deal .
in reality , though , they are making payments to separate companies .
if one part of the booking goes wrong or you are unable to take the holiday , you could lose all your money .
so , point four : always check the site to see what it is offering and look for some kind of protection , such as whether the company is a member of the association of british travel agents -lrb- abta -rrb- .
always complain to trading standards if you have any doubt about the holiday you have bought ... or if you 've suffered a holiday nightmare . "
the views expressed are solely those of bruce treloar 's and not the bbc 's .
any guidance is for general information only and does not constitute legal advice .

bruce treloar , the trading standards institute 's senior officer on the holiday and travel industry , offers some advice .
no more holiday nightmares ... you must be kidding ! !
from brochures to websites , from tour operators to no-frills airlines , from agents to tv , and from pricing to insurance , the consumer has never had it so bad .
let us take you on a journey of holiday selection , holiday booking , parting with your money , enjoying the break - and then returning , hopefully with little or no complaint !
-lrb- unlikely with a 12 % increase last year ... and that 's only concerning pricing ! -rrb- .
bait and trap consumers looking for a bargain late break are still unsure whether it is legal for travel agents to keep those special offers in their windows for long periods of time .
well , unless they are still available at the advertised price , it is illegal .
never be seduced by cheap holiday offers before checking the extras you 'll have to pay bruce treloar if we get complaints we can prosecute travel agents for advertising outdated offers , or if the holiday is only being made available at a higher price .
so , point number one : be careful of the ' bait and trap ' scenario .
you can be drawn into a shop or website by an advertised cheap offer , ' the bait ' , only to find yourself ' trapped ' when you are offered the same holiday but at a higher price .
what about holiday brochures ?
the first point to make is that whether they are traditional holiday brochures or websites , the same rules apply .
they must show prices and these must be accurate - the same goes for descriptions .
watch the price fluid or flexible pricing is a huge issue , which consumers are often unaware of until they are charged more than the brochure price .
will your holiday match the brochure description ?
some operators love to put a price in a brochure and then when demand is high they increase it .
when demand is low they then make a big thing about discounts .
this is known as fluid pricing - and it is illegal .
consumers tell us they still want to sit with their families and view a selection of brochures and compare prices , but this can be impossible because the prices are often changing .
also , we 've found consumers are seduced by the claim from some operators that they can guarantee all prices in the brochure will be discounted .
in our view this makes some prices artificially high and inaccurate .
extra charges for the infamous " insurance and security " levies are another way of illegally increasing the price of holidays .
if the price in the brochure says £ 200 it should mean that , not £ 200 plus a levy of £ 12 .
' seduction ' techniques so , point two : never be seduced by cheap holiday offers before checking the extras you 'll have to pay and if you do n't like it , complain to trading standards .
always shop around for travel insurance - and make sure you understand the policy 's exclusions so , you 've chosen the holiday .
do you need travel insurance ?
in our view you do .
but travel insurance from tour operators and agents is often much more expensive , so resist the hard sell on insurance from travel agents or tour operators .
travel insurance can be bought from websites , from supermarkets and from a range of other household names , so it 's worth looking around .
it is important to check the small print .
we have found some insurers refusing to cover consumers from catching sars or even for the increased risks during the iraq conflict .
now we do have sympathy with the latter , but if the consumer booked before the epidemic and there is cover in the policy then consumers should be protected .
so , point three : always shop around for travel insurance - and make sure you understand the policy 's exclusions for medical cover , for example .
booking on the internet so , what 's the fuss about ' no-frills ' airlines ?
no-frills is just what it says : no in-flight meals and no transfers when you arrive at the airport , which may not be in a central location .
take care when booking trips on the internet the flights can be cheap , but you must book early to get the best price .
no-frills airlines have provided consumers with real choice .
they 've certainly made the big airlines sit up , i think , and this is excellent news for the consumer .
what we do n't like is the problems which occur when you buy directly over the internet .
if you are a consumer you are not protected if the airline goes bust - you will have no way of changing the flight or getting your money back .
unfortunately , the law says you are not required to hold a consumer protection licence , such as an " atol " , if you sell scheduled or no-frills flights over the net .
we are trying to get the law changed , so that all companies have some form of licensing to protect the customer .
another practice , which is equally confusing , is where a flight is bought on one screen and a link is offered to another screen to buy hotels or car hire .
the law protects consumers in package deals of this nature but the no-frills airlines often insist the consumer pays separately , and this means there is no protection if you buy through a linked website deal .
the problem is that people assume they are buying a packaged deal .
in reality , though , they are making payments to separate companies .
if one part of the booking goes wrong or you are unable to take the holiday , you could lose all your money .
so , point four : always check the site to see what it is offering and look for some kind of protection , such as whether the company is a member of the association of british travel agents -lrb- abta -rrb- .
always complain to trading standards if you have any doubt about the holiday you have bought ... or if you 've suffered a holiday nightmare .
the views expressed are solely those of bruce treloar 's and not the bbc 's .
any guidance is for general information only and does not constitute legal advice .

the research from the institute for fiscal studies says the total poverty gap - the total income by which families fall short of the poverty line - has increased under labour .
this is despite the fact that the actual number of poor children has fallen .
child poverty is one of labour 's key targets , and has been at the heart of the political agenda since 1999 .
the report said some families had benefited from new means-tested benefits and incentives to return to work , which has led to a fall in the number of poor children and improved living standards of the " vast majority of children " since 1997 .
but benefit take-up has been a problem among some of the poorest groups .
this could compel the government to re-think its policies and increase spending , the report said .
the researchers said the government was unlikely to abolish child poverty based on its current definition .
poorest groups the government wants to abolish child poverty by 2020 and halve it by 2010 .
some families with genuinely low incomes do not claim the means-tested benefits to which they are entitled institute for fiscal studies since 1996 , living standards have improved the most for children who were living just below the poverty line .
but children in households with the lowest incomes have benefited much less , the report said .
according to government surveys , 1.1 million children live in households with less than 40 % of the national average income .
four out of 10 of these children live in households that do not receive any of the main means-tested benefits - even though they may be entitled to claim .
" a lot do n't appear to be taking up benefits , " alissa goodman , one of the researchers , told bbc news online .
it has been estimated that as many as 600,000 families failed to claim working families tax credit - the old-style tax credit aimed at low-income families , which was replaced by new tax credits in april 2003 .
the researchers said part of the reason might be because there would always be a group of families who were temporarily on low incomes , and therefore did not receive means-tested benefits .
but it could indicate a more sustained trend concerning non take-up of benefits , and this could pose a serious long-term problem for the government 's targets .
" some families with genuinely low incomes do not claim the means-tested benefits to which they are entitled , " the report in this month 's economic journal said .
" this group is obviously a genuine concern , and implies a range of policy responses . "
relative measures the researchers also questioned whether child poverty could ever be abolished using the government 's indicators .
the government 's measure for child poverty is a relative one .
whether a child is considered poor according to the government 's definition depends not only on the income of the household in which it lives but also the incomes of the whole population .
as incomes have risen rapidly in recent years , child poverty has become much more difficult to reduce in relative terms .
if the government , however , had fixed the poverty line at its level in 1996 , it would have been able to claim very large reductions in child poverty of around 1.2m in its first term .
the researchers concluded that reducing poverty would require more money from the government .
in previous research , it estimated that halving child poverty through the child tax credit might require additional expenditure of 1 % of gdp .

the researchers said part of the reason might be because there would always be a group of families who were temporarily on low incomes , and therefore did not receive means-tested benefits .
but it could indicate a more sustained trend concerning non take-up of benefits , and this could pose a serious long-term problem for the government 's targets .
" some families with genuinely low incomes do not claim the means-tested benefits to which they are entitled , " the report in this month 's economic journal said .

relative measures the researchers also questioned whether child poverty could ever be abolished using the government 's indicators .
the government 's measure for child poverty is a relative one .
whether a child is considered poor according to the government 's definition depends not only on the income of the household in which it lives but also the incomes of the whole population .
as incomes have risen rapidly in recent years , child poverty has become much more difficult to reduce in relative terms .
if the government , however , had fixed the poverty line at its level in 1996 , it would have been able to claim very large reductions in child poverty of around 1.2m in its first term .
the researchers concluded that reducing poverty would require more money from the government .
in previous research , it estimated that halving child poverty through the child tax credit might require additional expenditure of 1 % of gdp .

the central line was suspended for months after a train derailed in january , injuring 32 people .
an independent inquiry team found it crashed after a traction motor beneath the train fell off and hit the track .
now lu 's own technical report , due to be published next week , has discovered the reason it fell off .
it found bearings in the gearbox disintegrated and the shrapnel caused the drive shaft to fail .
the motor then started vibrating in the mountings , which melted away , and fell onto the tracks .
quick fix lu has been criticised for not looking more closely at what caused two previous cases of motors falling off trains .
it carried out a bolt inspection on the train 's motors , which did not identify faulty bearings as the problem .
rick justham , from the transport union transport salaried staffs ' association -lrb- tssa -rrb- , told bbc london : " alarm bells should have rung .
there were quite clearly problems here in terms of looking for a quick fix .
" what we have to do is make sure all investigations in the future are very thorough and actually look to the root cause , not just skimming over for a quick fix .
in a statement lu said : " we are fully committed to addressing the matters raised in the full report when it is published .
" in the meantime lu , our contractors and the railway inspectorate are satisfied the trains on the central line are safe . "
