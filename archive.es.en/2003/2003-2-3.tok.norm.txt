but a forestry project supported by gtz is helping to restore the ecological balance . the central province of the island of sri lanka has been producing world famous brands of tea for over a century .
after kenya , sri lanka is the largest exporter of tea in the world .
last year , more than a billion tonnes of tea from the island entered the world market .
but the success of sri lanka ’ s tea market has come at a cost .
over the past 50 years , thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared for tea cultivation .
the deforestation has led to a serious environmental imbalance and a shortage of firewood for around a million people employed in the plantations .
restoring the balance with the help of the german development agency gtz , the sri lankan government and the asian development bank , several plantation companies have managed to stem the tide of environmental destruction .
in 1999 , gtz launched the sri lanka-german estate forest and water resources development project , to promote sustainable forestry and the balanced use of water resources in sri lanka 's tea plantations .
the benefits of the € 2 million project have been significant .
as well as boosting the companies ' profits , the scheme has had a positive impact on the environment .
and the lives of the plantation workers have greatly improved .
environmental impact so far , twelve plantation companies have participated in the forestry program , which now covers an area of 100,000 ha .
the companies have begun planting trees in areas where tea is not grown , helping to reduce erosion and improving the micro-climate .
forestry is essential to maintaining an ecological balance in the plantations , according to ernie daniel , a plantation management expert .
" if you look at the plantation sector at the moment you will see there is very little forest cover around those areas now , " daniel told dw radio 's ravi prasad .
" systemised forestry can lead to an increased canopy cover , which reduces soil erosion and the run-off of water during heavy rains . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea plantation in nuwara eliya , sri lankan hill country .
added value as well as benefitting the environment , the forestry project ensures a regular supply of timber and firewood for the workers .
it has also provided a windfall for the plantation companies which have diversified into the commercial timber business .
those companies that joined the project early have already begun harvesting and selling wood from timber factories which operate side-by-side with the tea factories .
changing attitudes the project was intially resisted by managers and workers who were sceptical that growing trees in plantations would benefit them .
many workers feared that forestry would mean reduced tea cultivation and their livelihood would be damaged .
but when the timber was harvested , the workers began to feel the financial benefits , says nishantha wickremesinghe , the general manager of udupusselawa plantations .
" wood being available on the estate , the workers don ’ t have to trek miles and miles to find wood for their homes .
so their productivity improves .
and when their productivity goes up , their income earning capacity goes up , " explains wickremesinghe .
the plantation workers also take part in the havesting , and some have been trained to work at the timber factories to clean the harvested timber , providing them with an extra source of income .

" with the timber factory set up by the plantation , we have been able to earn a lot more , " he says .
" i supervised the logging of trees , like i do here in the plantations and was paid almost the same amount that i get there , anthony says .
" my income has doubled . "
quality of life for over a million workers like anthony and his family , the forestry project has improved their quality of life .
the women are now no longer forced to spend several hours each evening after completing a full day 's work , searching for dwindling supplies of firewood for cooking .
with improved living conditions , the plantation workers now have more time for social activities .
at one plantation , the workers have rebuilt a hindu temple using timber that could not be sold .
they now gather at the temple every day for evening prayers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.02.2003 germany takes over security council presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place at the roundtable : germany takes over presidency of the un security council as president of the un security council this month , germany will set the agenda for meetings that could decide if war breaks out against iraq .
the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .
instead , the german presidency will likely focus on the other trouble spots in the world - from the ivory coast to palestine - that will determine the day-to-day business of the security council until guinea takes over the role on march 1 . rainer sütfeld send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , iraq and the united nations a complete dossier of germany 's role in the united nations and its official positions regarding the iraq conflict .

will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”
next came “ popstars , ” which spawned the bands no angels and bro ’ sis , continuing presences at the top of the german charts .
now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .
each week during the show ’ s month-long pilot run the winner will go home with € 5,000 -lrb- $ 5,379 -rrb- . but those of you bored with leggy blond teenagers , desperate for fame and singing kylie cover versions , need not fear .
germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .

will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”
next came “ popstars , ” which spawned the bands no angels and bro ’ sis , continuing presences at the top of the german charts .
now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .
each week during the show ’ s month-long pilot run the winner will go home with € 5,000 -lrb- $ 5,379 -rrb- . but those of you bored with leggy blond teenagers , desperate for fame and singing kylie cover versions , need not fear .
germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .

but a forestry project supported by gtz is helping to restore the ecological balance . the central province of the island of sri lanka has been producing world famous brands of tea for over a century .
after kenya , sri lanka is the largest exporter of tea in the world .
last year , more than a billion tonnes of tea from the island entered the world market .
but the success of sri lanka ’ s tea market has come at a cost .
over the past 50 years , thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared for tea cultivation .
the deforestation has led to a serious environmental imbalance and a shortage of firewood for around a million people employed in the plantations .
restoring the balance with the help of the german development agency gtz , the sri lankan government and the asian development bank , several plantation companies have managed to stem the tide of environmental destruction .
in 1999 , gtz launched the sri lanka-german estate forest and water resources development project , to promote sustainable forestry and the balanced use of water resources in sri lanka 's tea plantations .
the benefits of the € 2 million project have been significant .
as well as boosting the companies ' profits , the scheme has had a positive impact on the environment .
and the lives of the plantation workers have greatly improved .
environmental impact so far , twelve plantation companies have participated in the forestry program , which now covers an area of 100,000 ha .
the companies have begun planting trees in areas where tea is not grown , helping to reduce erosion and improving the micro-climate .
forestry is essential to maintaining an ecological balance in the plantations , according to ernie daniel , a plantation management expert .
" if you look at the plantation sector at the moment you will see there is very little forest cover around those areas now , " daniel told dw radio 's ravi prasad .
" systemised forestry can lead to an increased canopy cover , which reduces soil erosion and the run-off of water during heavy rains . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea plantation in nuwara eliya , sri lankan hill country .
added value as well as benefitting the environment , the forestry project ensures a regular supply of timber and firewood for the workers .
it has also provided a windfall for the plantation companies which have diversified into the commercial timber business .
those companies that joined the project early have already begun harvesting and selling wood from timber factories which operate side-by-side with the tea factories .
changing attitudes the project was intially resisted by managers and workers who were sceptical that growing trees in plantations would benefit them .
many workers feared that forestry would mean reduced tea cultivation and their livelihood would be damaged .
but when the timber was harvested , the workers began to feel the financial benefits , says nishantha wickremesinghe , the general manager of udupusselawa plantations .
" wood being available on the estate , the workers don ’ t have to trek miles and miles to find wood for their homes .
so their productivity improves .
and when their productivity goes up , their income earning capacity goes up , " explains wickremesinghe .
the plantation workers also take part in the havesting , and some have been trained to work at the timber factories to clean the harvested timber , providing them with an extra source of income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea-picker in sri lanka .
photo , ravi prasad anthony , a ‘ kandani ’ or supervisor for twenty years , says the forestry project has made a big difference for his family .
" with the timber factory set up by the plantation , we have been able to earn a lot more , " he says .
" i supervised the logging of trees , like i do here in the plantations and was paid almost the same amount that i get there , anthony says .
" my income has doubled . "
quality of life for over a million workers like anthony and his family , the forestry project has improved their quality of life .
the women are now no longer forced to spend several hours each evening after completing a full day 's work , searching for dwindling supplies of firewood for cooking .
with improved living conditions , the plantation workers now have more time for social activities .
at one plantation , the workers have rebuilt a hindu temple using timber that could not be sold .
they now gather at the temple every day for evening prayers .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .

in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .
voters decide its payback time having just received their january paychecks and seen what was missing , voters in the northwestern state of lower saxony and the central state of hesse obviously decided to deliver a message to the german chancellor .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .
the election now adds six seats to their 35-seat majority .
however , it is in the conciliation committee that the red-green coalition will face the sharpest winds coming from the opposition .
until the elections , the government had a slim majority of one vote .
now , following sunday 's victory , both sides have the exact number of votes in a commitee which is essential to the solving of disputes over new laws , and at present , for the realisation of the government 's reforms . members of the chrisitian democratic union and its bavarian-based sister party , the christian social union , vowed they would take advantage of their new power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.02.2003 reality tv still a hit in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gracia baur is the latest to be voted off german " pop idol " germany ’ s version of " pop idol " has the country on the edge of its seat , and now the german public service broadcaster has launched its own take on the postmodern talent show .
will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”
next came “ popstars , ” which spawned the bands no angels and bro ’ sis , continuing presences at the top of the german charts .
now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .
each week during the show ’ s month-long pilot run the winner will go home with € 5,000 -lrb- $ 5,379 -rrb- . but those of you bored with leggy blond teenagers , desperate for fame and singing kylie cover versions , need not fear .
germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .
just the job for those dark winter evenings . especially since withdrawal symptoms may abound after the excitement over germany ’ s search for a superstar finally subsides .
with the final just weeks away , the favorite , 20-year-old gracia , was voted out in the sixth round on saturday evening . tears and more tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an evening which oddly mirrored an episode in the british version of the show , 17- year-old daniel k. sobbed uncontrollably as fellow bavarian gracia baur -lrb- “ who was like a sister to me ” -rrb- had to leave .
in britain , it was 16-year-old gareth gates who broke down on live television , when his pop idol friend and colleague , 17-year-old zoe birkett - also from his home county - was voted off the show in the penultimate round of the competition . but whilst the performers are in tears , the businessmen certainly aren ’ t crying .
" superstar , " like “ popstars ” and “ big brother ” before it , is a ratings hit , with audiences of 10 million regularly tuning in .
the show ’ s broadcaster , rtl - which broadcast the other shows in germany too - is currently the leading channel in the country .
figures for january reveal that the rtl has a market share of 19.6 percent . the single brought out by the eleven " superstar " finalists , entitled “ we have a dream ” - and continuing with the lyrics “ music is our life ” - is number one in the german charts for the fourth week .
not even eminem ’ s hit song “ lose yourself ” from the film “ 8 mile ” could nudge it off the top spot . german " popstars " band still going strong and unlike hear ’ say , the band created by the uk “ popstars ” program , which broke up after less than two years in the limelight , teutonic girl group no angels and its successors from the same show , bro ’ sis , are still going strong . “ the trick with both no angels and bro ’ sis is that they continually develop , ” hannes ross , music critic at stern magazine told dw-world .
no angels ’ first cd sold well anyway , as was expected , but with the second they proved they could actually write songs too .
and now , by releasing a swing album , they ’ ve latched onto an older consumer group .
now the 50-somethings are buying their records as well , ” ross said . as to " superstar , " ross reckons the show ’ s success has nothing to do with the recession that germany is currently suffering , a theory touted by much of the german press . " ' superstar ' would have been a success even if germany had been having a huge boom .
it has nothing to do with escapism in the midst of recession .
i don ’ t believe such theories , " he told dw-world .
" the show ’ s secret is that it ’ s three shows in one .
firstly , it ’ s a music show .
then , it ’ s a big saturday night entertainment show .
and thirdly , it ’ s reality tv : the audience gets the excitement of voting people off . ” although germany is still crazy about reality tv , whether pop culture shows like “ superstar ” will eventually wear thin here is uncertain . ross believes shows like " superstar " and " big brother " will be on german screens for a long while yet .
“ i don ’ t think this is the end of pop culture as we know it , ” he says , “ even though people say it is . ”
in which case , by the time the " superstar " finale is broadcast on march 8 fans of german high culture may start to think its time to leave the country . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links deutschland sucht den superstar web site of the rtl " pop idol " show -lrb- in german -rrb- 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”
next came “ popstars , ” which spawned the bands no angels and bro ’ sis , continuing presences at the top of the german charts .
now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .
each week during the show ’ s month-long pilot run the winner will go home with € 5,000 -lrb- $ 5,379 -rrb- . but those of you bored with leggy blond teenagers , desperate for fame and singing kylie cover versions , need not fear .
germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .
just the job for those dark winter evenings . especially since withdrawal symptoms may abound after the excitement over germany ’ s search for a superstar finally subsides .
with the final just weeks away , the favorite , 20-year-old gracia , was voted out in the sixth round on saturday evening . tears and more tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an evening which oddly mirrored an episode in the british version of the show , 17- year-old daniel k. sobbed uncontrollably as fellow bavarian gracia baur -lrb- “ who was like a sister to me ” -rrb- had to leave .
in britain , it was 16-year-old gareth gates who broke down on live television , when his pop idol friend and colleague , 17-year-old zoe birkett - also from his home county - was voted off the show in the penultimate round of the competition . but whilst the performers are in tears , the businessmen certainly aren ’ t crying .
" superstar , " like “ popstars ” and “ big brother ” before it , is a ratings hit , with audiences of 10 million regularly tuning in .
the show ’ s broadcaster , rtl - which broadcast the other shows in germany too - is currently the leading channel in the country .
figures for january reveal that the rtl has a market share of 19.6 percent . the single brought out by the eleven " superstar " finalists , entitled “ we have a dream ” - and continuing with the lyrics “ music is our life ” - is number one in the german charts for the fourth week .
not even eminem ’ s hit song “ lose yourself ” from the film “ 8 mile ” could nudge it off the top spot . german " popstars " band still going strong and unlike hear ’ say , the band created by the uk “ popstars ” program , which broke up after less than two years in the limelight , teutonic girl group no angels and its successors from the same show , bro ’ sis , are still going strong . “ the trick with both no angels and bro ’ sis is that they continually develop , ” hannes ross , music critic at stern magazine told dw-world .
no angels ’ first cd sold well anyway , as was expected , but with the second they proved they could actually write songs too .
and now , by releasing a swing album , they ’ ve latched onto an older consumer group .
now the 50-somethings are buying their records as well , ” ross said . as to " superstar , " ross reckons the show ’ s success has nothing to do with the recession that germany is currently suffering , a theory touted by much of the german press . " ' superstar ' would have been a success even if germany had been having a huge boom .
it has nothing to do with escapism in the midst of recession .
i don ’ t believe such theories , " he told dw-world .
" the show ’ s secret is that it ’ s three shows in one .
firstly , it ’ s a music show .
then , it ’ s a big saturday night entertainment show .
and thirdly , it ’ s reality tv : the audience gets the excitement of voting people off . ” although germany is still crazy about reality tv , whether pop culture shows like “ superstar ” will eventually wear thin here is uncertain . ross believes shows like " superstar " and " big brother " will be on german screens for a long while yet .
“ i don ’ t think this is the end of pop culture as we know it , ” he says , “ even though people say it is . ”
in which case , by the time the " superstar " finale is broadcast on march 8 fans of german high culture may start to think its time to leave the country . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links deutschland sucht den superstar web site of the rtl " pop idol " show -lrb- in german -rrb- 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

but a forestry project supported by gtz is helping to restore the ecological balance . the central province of the island of sri lanka has been producing world famous brands of tea for over a century .
after kenya , sri lanka is the largest exporter of tea in the world .
last year , more than a billion tonnes of tea from the island entered the world market .
but the success of sri lanka ’ s tea market has come at a cost .
over the past 50 years , thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared for tea cultivation .
the deforestation has led to a serious environmental imbalance and a shortage of firewood for around a million people employed in the plantations .
restoring the balance with the help of the german development agency gtz , the sri lankan government and the asian development bank , several plantation companies have managed to stem the tide of environmental destruction .
in 1999 , gtz launched the sri lanka-german estate forest and water resources development project , to promote sustainable forestry and the balanced use of water resources in sri lanka 's tea plantations .
the benefits of the € 2 million project have been significant .
as well as boosting the companies ' profits , the scheme has had a positive impact on the environment .
and the lives of the plantation workers have greatly improved .
environmental impact so far , twelve plantation companies have participated in the forestry program , which now covers an area of 100,000 ha .
the companies have begun planting trees in areas where tea is not grown , helping to reduce erosion and improving the micro-climate .
forestry is essential to maintaining an ecological balance in the plantations , according to ernie daniel , a plantation management expert .
" if you look at the plantation sector at the moment you will see there is very little forest cover around those areas now , " daniel told dw radio 's ravi prasad .
" systemised forestry can lead to an increased canopy cover , which reduces soil erosion and the run-off of water during heavy rains . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea plantation in nuwara eliya , sri lankan hill country .
added value as well as benefitting the environment , the forestry project ensures a regular supply of timber and firewood for the workers .
it has also provided a windfall for the plantation companies which have diversified into the commercial timber business .
those companies that joined the project early have already begun harvesting and selling wood from timber factories which operate side-by-side with the tea factories .
changing attitudes the project was intially resisted by managers and workers who were sceptical that growing trees in plantations would benefit them .
many workers feared that forestry would mean reduced tea cultivation and their livelihood would be damaged .
but when the timber was harvested , the workers began to feel the financial benefits , says nishantha wickremesinghe , the general manager of udupusselawa plantations .
" wood being available on the estate , the workers don ’ t have to trek miles and miles to find wood for their homes .
so their productivity improves .
and when their productivity goes up , their income earning capacity goes up , " explains wickremesinghe .
the plantation workers also take part in the havesting , and some have been trained to work at the timber factories to clean the harvested timber , providing them with an extra source of income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea-picker in sri lanka .
photo , ravi prasad anthony , a ‘ kandani ’ or supervisor for twenty years , says the forestry project has made a big difference for his family .
" with the timber factory set up by the plantation , we have been able to earn a lot more , " he says .
" i supervised the logging of trees , like i do here in the plantations and was paid almost the same amount that i get there , anthony says .
" my income has doubled . "
quality of life for over a million workers like anthony and his family , the forestry project has improved their quality of life .
the women are now no longer forced to spend several hours each evening after completing a full day 's work , searching for dwindling supplies of firewood for cooking .
with improved living conditions , the plantation workers now have more time for social activities .
at one plantation , the workers have rebuilt a hindu temple using timber that could not be sold .
they now gather at the temple every day for evening prayers .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .
voters decide its payback time having just received their january paychecks and seen what was missing , voters in the northwestern state of lower saxony and the central state of hesse obviously decided to deliver a message to the german chancellor .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .
the election now adds six seats to their 35-seat majority .
however , it is in the conciliation committee that the red-green coalition will face the sharpest winds coming from the opposition .
until the elections , the government had a slim majority of one vote .
now , following sunday 's victory , both sides have the exact number of votes in a commitee which is essential to the solving of disputes over new laws , and at present , for the realisation of the government 's reforms . members of the chrisitian democratic union and its bavarian-based sister party , the christian social union , vowed they would take advantage of their new power .
" i think we now will be able to force through a change of political direction , " said edmund stoiber , the head of the christian social union and the union 's parties chancellor candidate in the 2002 elections . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de support for social democrats hits historic low with two important regional elections due at the start of february , germany 's social democrats are staring a possible humbling defeat full in the face after support for the party dropped to an historic low on friday .

german shoppers are setting a new trend - so-called " hybrid " shopping . when it comes to shopping for the daily evening meal , germans are showing increasingly diverging consumer habits . with the current economic slump and a steady decline in retail sales , german shopping habits are changing - away from the sole weekly or monthly big shop at the supermarket to a more erratic way of consumption .
the society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- in nürnberg has noticed that german consumers no longer solely rely on supermarkets for their sustenance .
instead , increasing amounts of so-called " hybrid shoppers " are combining supermarket visits with trips to smaller food retailers , petrol stations and vendors in railway stations .
" the percentage of hybrid shoppers within the population appears to be getting larger , " said wolfgang twardawa from the society of consumer research in the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
shoppers head to smaller stores despite higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to shop around - as long as its near , and open late for market psychologists , the trend of " hybrid shopping " is a new development .
this new behavior does not seem to be based purely on the economic situation in germany , as many smaller outlets , including petrol station kiosks , tend to be more expensive than discount supermarkets like aldi , lidl and penny markt .
so , is it a matter of pure convenience ?
the statistics suggest so .
after a period where convenience stores have had to cope with a 2.5 percent sales shrinkage and many closed as a result , custom in small stores has increased : claudia gaspar , also of the gfk , said " every fifth german now uses a combination of the stores on offer ; local budget stores , small shops and fast food outlets , " .
small family-run stores , known in germany as " tante emma läden " - aunt emma shops , are benefiting greatly from the buying habits of these new " hybrid shoppers " .
these shoppers , who may pick up a yogurt from the supermarket on their way to work , are the same people who will buy food for the evening from the nearest corner shop or outlet - places that normally stay open a lot longer than regular supermarkets .
boom time is when supermarkets are closed " kiosks and petrol stations are getting the big sales during the classic commuter times , in the early morning and the early evening , " said suzanne eicholz-klein from bonn enterprise consultants bbe .
one success story of the growing boom is that of um 's eck , a franchise of small stores that was created to fight the squeeze of the bigger chains .
started in the dark days of small business during 1999 in the southern german town of ochsenhausen , the franchise now boasts 120 branches across the country .
" the idea is that the customers come back to the local and personal ... and keep coming back , " said um 's eck sales chief gebhard voltenauer in the report in die zeit .
it seems that germans are not only buying increasing amounts of items on their shopping lists from smaller outlets and petrol stations but are also buying ready-to-eat meals from these stores .
fast food restaurants beware - petroleum company aral has moved into fourth place in the german take-away league behind such big hitters as mcdonalds , burger king and the german fish outlet nordsee .
fast food , snacks and videos boost aral sales fuel sales aside , aral 's retail business is now worth around two million euro a year -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- with its petrol stations not only being an alternative to the usual fast food outlet but also the first stop in the morning as an alternative to breakfast at home .
in the last year , 150 million bread rolls were sold from petrol stations in germany .
add the business that is attracted by having over two thousand cash machines on forecourts across the country and the fact that some outlets hire videos to go with the chips and coke , it becomes clearer why a trip to the petrol station is featuring more heavily in consumers ' behavior .
in fact , the increasing presence of aral in the fast food charts is indicative of another trend that 's pulling the germans away from traditional shopping habits .
the numbers of people preferring take-away food continues to rise year on year .
estimates suggest that figures for 2002 will show that the amount of money spent on fast food has almost doubled since 1991 , taking spending across germany to 21.5 billion euro .
even with decelerated growth , germans are still expected to spend 25.6 billion euro on take-away food in 2010 .
small businesses benefit in the face of german slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehemalige wechselstelle im grenzübergang , der raum wird heute als kiosk für die gäste der veranstaltungen benutzt .
zu sehen ist noch das originalschild rechte : tränenpalast veranstaltungsgmbh the contradictions are rife .
while consumers seem to be ignoring the economic situation in favor of convenience , the booming business of " tante emma " stores and fast food outlets are in direct contrast to recent news that recession-hit german consumers have reined in spending .

german shoppers are setting a new trend - so-called " hybrid " shopping . when it comes to shopping for the daily evening meal , germans are showing increasingly diverging consumer habits . with the current economic slump and a steady decline in retail sales , german shopping habits are changing - away from the sole weekly or monthly big shop at the supermarket to a more erratic way of consumption .
the society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- in nürnberg has noticed that german consumers no longer solely rely on supermarkets for their sustenance .
instead , increasing amounts of so-called " hybrid shoppers " are combining supermarket visits with trips to smaller food retailers , petrol stations and vendors in railway stations .
" the percentage of hybrid shoppers within the population appears to be getting larger , " said wolfgang twardawa from the society of consumer research in the german weekly newspaper die zeit .

this new behavior does not seem to be based purely on the economic situation in germany , as many smaller outlets , including petrol station kiosks , tend to be more expensive than discount supermarkets like aldi , lidl and penny markt .
so , is it a matter of pure convenience ?
the statistics suggest so .

small family-run stores , known in germany as " tante emma läden " - aunt emma shops , are benefiting greatly from the buying habits of these new " hybrid shoppers " .
these shoppers , who may pick up a yogurt from the supermarket on their way to work , are the same people who will buy food for the evening from the nearest corner shop or outlet - places that normally stay open a lot longer than regular supermarkets .
boom time is when supermarkets are closed " kiosks and petrol stations are getting the big sales during the classic commuter times , in the early morning and the early evening , " said suzanne eicholz-klein from bonn enterprise consultants bbe .

the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .
instead , the german presidency will likely focus on the other trouble spots in the world - from the ivory coast to palestine - that will determine the day-to-day business of the security council until guinea takes over the role on march 1 . rainer sütfeld send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , iraq and the united nations a complete dossier of germany 's role in the united nations and its official positions regarding the iraq conflict .

the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .

will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”
next came “ popstars , ” which spawned the bands no angels and bro ’ sis , continuing presences at the top of the german charts .
now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .
each week during the show ’ s month-long pilot run the winner will go home with € 5,000 -lrb- $ 5,379 -rrb- . but those of you bored with leggy blond teenagers , desperate for fame and singing kylie cover versions , need not fear .
germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .
just the job for those dark winter evenings . especially since withdrawal symptoms may abound after the excitement over germany ’ s search for a superstar finally subsides .
with the final just weeks away , the favorite , 20-year-old gracia , was voted out in the sixth round on saturday evening . tears and more tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an evening which oddly mirrored an episode in the british version of the show , 17- year-old daniel k. sobbed uncontrollably as fellow bavarian gracia baur -lrb- “ who was like a sister to me ” -rrb- had to leave .
in britain , it was 16-year-old gareth gates who broke down on live television , when his pop idol friend and colleague , 17-year-old zoe birkett - also from his home county - was voted off the show in the penultimate round of the competition . but whilst the performers are in tears , the businessmen certainly aren ’ t crying .
" superstar , " like “ popstars ” and “ big brother ” before it , is a ratings hit , with audiences of 10 million regularly tuning in .
the show ’ s broadcaster , rtl - which broadcast the other shows in germany too - is currently the leading channel in the country .
figures for january reveal that the rtl has a market share of 19.6 percent . the single brought out by the eleven " superstar " finalists , entitled “ we have a dream ” - and continuing with the lyrics “ music is our life ” - is number one in the german charts for the fourth week .
not even eminem ’ s hit song “ lose yourself ” from the film “ 8 mile ” could nudge it off the top spot . german " popstars " band still going strong and unlike hear ’ say , the band created by the uk “ popstars ” program , which broke up after less than two years in the limelight , teutonic girl group no angels and its successors from the same show , bro ’ sis , are still going strong . “ the trick with both no angels and bro ’ sis is that they continually develop , ” hannes ross , music critic at stern magazine told dw-world .
no angels ’ first cd sold well anyway , as was expected , but with the second they proved they could actually write songs too .
and now , by releasing a swing album , they ’ ve latched onto an older consumer group .
now the 50-somethings are buying their records as well , ” ross said . as to " superstar , " ross reckons the show ’ s success has nothing to do with the recession that germany is currently suffering , a theory touted by much of the german press . " ' superstar ' would have been a success even if germany had been having a huge boom .
it has nothing to do with escapism in the midst of recession .
i don ’ t believe such theories , " he told dw-world .
" the show ’ s secret is that it ’ s three shows in one .
firstly , it ’ s a music show .
then , it ’ s a big saturday night entertainment show .
and thirdly , it ’ s reality tv : the audience gets the excitement of voting people off . ” although germany is still crazy about reality tv , whether pop culture shows like “ superstar ” will eventually wear thin here is uncertain . ross believes shows like " superstar " and " big brother " will be on german screens for a long while yet .
“ i don ’ t think this is the end of pop culture as we know it , ” he says , “ even though people say it is . ”
in which case , by the time the " superstar " finale is broadcast on march 8 fans of german high culture may start to think its time to leave the country . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links deutschland sucht den superstar web site of the rtl " pop idol " show -lrb- in german -rrb- 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

but a forestry project supported by gtz is helping to restore the ecological balance . the central province of the island of sri lanka has been producing world famous brands of tea for over a century .
after kenya , sri lanka is the largest exporter of tea in the world .
last year , more than a billion tonnes of tea from the island entered the world market .
but the success of sri lanka ’ s tea market has come at a cost .
over the past 50 years , thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared for tea cultivation .
the deforestation has led to a serious environmental imbalance and a shortage of firewood for around a million people employed in the plantations .
restoring the balance with the help of the german development agency gtz , the sri lankan government and the asian development bank , several plantation companies have managed to stem the tide of environmental destruction .
in 1999 , gtz launched the sri lanka-german estate forest and water resources development project , to promote sustainable forestry and the balanced use of water resources in sri lanka 's tea plantations .
the benefits of the € 2 million project have been significant .
as well as boosting the companies ' profits , the scheme has had a positive impact on the environment .
and the lives of the plantation workers have greatly improved .
environmental impact so far , twelve plantation companies have participated in the forestry program , which now covers an area of 100,000 ha .
the companies have begun planting trees in areas where tea is not grown , helping to reduce erosion and improving the micro-climate .
forestry is essential to maintaining an ecological balance in the plantations , according to ernie daniel , a plantation management expert .
" if you look at the plantation sector at the moment you will see there is very little forest cover around those areas now , " daniel told dw radio 's ravi prasad .
" systemised forestry can lead to an increased canopy cover , which reduces soil erosion and the run-off of water during heavy rains . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea plantation in nuwara eliya , sri lankan hill country .
added value as well as benefitting the environment , the forestry project ensures a regular supply of timber and firewood for the workers .
it has also provided a windfall for the plantation companies which have diversified into the commercial timber business .
those companies that joined the project early have already begun harvesting and selling wood from timber factories which operate side-by-side with the tea factories .
changing attitudes the project was intially resisted by managers and workers who were sceptical that growing trees in plantations would benefit them .
many workers feared that forestry would mean reduced tea cultivation and their livelihood would be damaged .
but when the timber was harvested , the workers began to feel the financial benefits , says nishantha wickremesinghe , the general manager of udupusselawa plantations .
" wood being available on the estate , the workers don ’ t have to trek miles and miles to find wood for their homes .
so their productivity improves .
and when their productivity goes up , their income earning capacity goes up , " explains wickremesinghe .
the plantation workers also take part in the havesting , and some have been trained to work at the timber factories to clean the harvested timber , providing them with an extra source of income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea-picker in sri lanka .
photo , ravi prasad anthony , a ‘ kandani ’ or supervisor for twenty years , says the forestry project has made a big difference for his family .
" with the timber factory set up by the plantation , we have been able to earn a lot more , " he says .
" i supervised the logging of trees , like i do here in the plantations and was paid almost the same amount that i get there , anthony says .
" my income has doubled . "
quality of life for over a million workers like anthony and his family , the forestry project has improved their quality of life .
the women are now no longer forced to spend several hours each evening after completing a full day 's work , searching for dwindling supplies of firewood for cooking .
with improved living conditions , the plantation workers now have more time for social activities .
at one plantation , the workers have rebuilt a hindu temple using timber that could not be sold .
they now gather at the temple every day for evening prayers .

the spokesman , walter lindner , made the statement in response to an article in the süddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper reported monday that the german government was refusing to supply the missiles because of its anti-war position .
during the 1991 persian gulf war , germany supplied the missiles to turkey .
scientology granted tax-free status the scientology church , the target of government monitoring in germany , has been granted tax-free status within the country , the church announced on monday .
officials made the decision based on a tax treaty between germany and the united states , where the church has tax-exempt status .
the ruling covers license fees the church receives for information and training films .
until now , the church has paid a 25 percent tax on the income .
that money will now be refunded .
critics consider scientology to be a money-hungry , unscrupulous operation .
its activities are monitored in 15 of germany 's 16 states by the country 's domestic intelligence service .

german shoppers are setting a new trend - so-called " hybrid " shopping . when it comes to shopping for the daily evening meal , germans are showing increasingly diverging consumer habits . with the current economic slump and a steady decline in retail sales , german shopping habits are changing - away from the sole weekly or monthly big shop at the supermarket to a more erratic way of consumption .
the society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- in nürnberg has noticed that german consumers no longer solely rely on supermarkets for their sustenance .
instead , increasing amounts of so-called " hybrid shoppers " are combining supermarket visits with trips to smaller food retailers , petrol stations and vendors in railway stations .
" the percentage of hybrid shoppers within the population appears to be getting larger , " said wolfgang twardawa from the society of consumer research in the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
shoppers head to smaller stores despite higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to shop around - as long as its near , and open late for market psychologists , the trend of " hybrid shopping " is a new development .
this new behavior does not seem to be based purely on the economic situation in germany , as many smaller outlets , including petrol station kiosks , tend to be more expensive than discount supermarkets like aldi , lidl and penny markt .
so , is it a matter of pure convenience ?
the statistics suggest so .
after a period where convenience stores have had to cope with a 2.5 percent sales shrinkage and many closed as a result , custom in small stores has increased : claudia gaspar , also of the gfk , said " every fifth german now uses a combination of the stores on offer ; local budget stores , small shops and fast food outlets , " .
small family-run stores , known in germany as " tante emma läden " - aunt emma shops , are benefiting greatly from the buying habits of these new " hybrid shoppers " .
these shoppers , who may pick up a yogurt from the supermarket on their way to work , are the same people who will buy food for the evening from the nearest corner shop or outlet - places that normally stay open a lot longer than regular supermarkets .
boom time is when supermarkets are closed " kiosks and petrol stations are getting the big sales during the classic commuter times , in the early morning and the early evening , " said suzanne eicholz-klein from bonn enterprise consultants bbe .
one success story of the growing boom is that of um 's eck , a franchise of small stores that was created to fight the squeeze of the bigger chains .
started in the dark days of small business during 1999 in the southern german town of ochsenhausen , the franchise now boasts 120 branches across the country .
" the idea is that the customers come back to the local and personal ... and keep coming back , " said um 's eck sales chief gebhard voltenauer in the report in die zeit .
it seems that germans are not only buying increasing amounts of items on their shopping lists from smaller outlets and petrol stations but are also buying ready-to-eat meals from these stores .
fast food restaurants beware - petroleum company aral has moved into fourth place in the german take-away league behind such big hitters as mcdonalds , burger king and the german fish outlet nordsee .
fast food , snacks and videos boost aral sales fuel sales aside , aral 's retail business is now worth around two million euro a year -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- with its petrol stations not only being an alternative to the usual fast food outlet but also the first stop in the morning as an alternative to breakfast at home .
in the last year , 150 million bread rolls were sold from petrol stations in germany .
add the business that is attracted by having over two thousand cash machines on forecourts across the country and the fact that some outlets hire videos to go with the chips and coke , it becomes clearer why a trip to the petrol station is featuring more heavily in consumers ' behavior .
in fact , the increasing presence of aral in the fast food charts is indicative of another trend that 's pulling the germans away from traditional shopping habits .
the numbers of people preferring take-away food continues to rise year on year .
estimates suggest that figures for 2002 will show that the amount of money spent on fast food has almost doubled since 1991 , taking spending across germany to 21.5 billion euro .
even with decelerated growth , germans are still expected to spend 25.6 billion euro on take-away food in 2010 .

german shoppers are setting a new trend - so-called " hybrid " shopping . when it comes to shopping for the daily evening meal , germans are showing increasingly diverging consumer habits . with the current economic slump and a steady decline in retail sales , german shopping habits are changing - away from the sole weekly or monthly big shop at the supermarket to a more erratic way of consumption .
the society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- in nürnberg has noticed that german consumers no longer solely rely on supermarkets for their sustenance .
instead , increasing amounts of so-called " hybrid shoppers " are combining supermarket visits with trips to smaller food retailers , petrol stations and vendors in railway stations .
" the percentage of hybrid shoppers within the population appears to be getting larger , " said wolfgang twardawa from the society of consumer research in the german weekly newspaper die zeit .

this new behavior does not seem to be based purely on the economic situation in germany , as many smaller outlets , including petrol station kiosks , tend to be more expensive than discount supermarkets like aldi , lidl and penny markt .

small family-run stores , known in germany as " tante emma läden " - aunt emma shops , are benefiting greatly from the buying habits of these new " hybrid shoppers " .
these shoppers , who may pick up a yogurt from the supermarket on their way to work , are the same people who will buy food for the evening from the nearest corner shop or outlet - places that normally stay open a lot longer than regular supermarkets .
boom time is when supermarkets are closed " kiosks and petrol stations are getting the big sales during the classic commuter times , in the early morning and the early evening , " said suzanne eicholz-klein from bonn enterprise consultants bbe .
one success story of the growing boom is that of um 's eck , a franchise of small stores that was created to fight the squeeze of the bigger chains .
started in the dark days of small business during 1999 in the southern german town of ochsenhausen , the franchise now boasts 120 branches across the country .
" the idea is that the customers come back to the local and personal ... and keep coming back , " said um 's eck sales chief gebhard voltenauer in the report in die zeit .
it seems that germans are not only buying increasing amounts of items on their shopping lists from smaller outlets and petrol stations but are also buying ready-to-eat meals from these stores .
fast food restaurants beware - petroleum company aral has moved into fourth place in the german take-away league behind such big hitters as mcdonalds , burger king and the german fish outlet nordsee .
fast food , snacks and videos boost aral sales fuel sales aside , aral 's retail business is now worth around two million euro a year -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- with its petrol stations not only being an alternative to the usual fast food outlet but also the first stop in the morning as an alternative to breakfast at home .
in the last year , 150 million bread rolls were sold from petrol stations in germany .
add the business that is attracted by having over two thousand cash machines on forecourts across the country and the fact that some outlets hire videos to go with the chips and coke , it becomes clearer why a trip to the petrol station is featuring more heavily in consumers ' behavior .

reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .

will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”
next came “ popstars , ” which spawned the bands no angels and bro ’ sis , continuing presences at the top of the german charts .
now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .
each week during the show ’ s month-long pilot run the winner will go home with € 5,000 -lrb- $ 5,379 -rrb- . but those of you bored with leggy blond teenagers , desperate for fame and singing kylie cover versions , need not fear .
germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .
just the job for those dark winter evenings . especially since withdrawal symptoms may abound after the excitement over germany ’ s search for a superstar finally subsides .
with the final just weeks away , the favorite , 20-year-old gracia , was voted out in the sixth round on saturday evening . tears and more tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an evening which oddly mirrored an episode in the british version of the show , 17- year-old daniel k. sobbed uncontrollably as fellow bavarian gracia baur -lrb- “ who was like a sister to me ” -rrb- had to leave .
in britain , it was 16-year-old gareth gates who broke down on live television , when his pop idol friend and colleague , 17-year-old zoe birkett - also from his home county - was voted off the show in the penultimate round of the competition . but whilst the performers are in tears , the businessmen certainly aren ’ t crying .
" superstar , " like “ popstars ” and “ big brother ” before it , is a ratings hit , with audiences of 10 million regularly tuning in .
the show ’ s broadcaster , rtl - which broadcast the other shows in germany too - is currently the leading channel in the country .
figures for january reveal that the rtl has a market share of 19.6 percent . the single brought out by the eleven " superstar " finalists , entitled “ we have a dream ” - and continuing with the lyrics “ music is our life ” - is number one in the german charts for the fourth week .

no angels ’ first cd sold well anyway , as was expected , but with the second they proved they could actually write songs too .

it has nothing to do with escapism in the midst of recession .

“ i don ’ t think this is the end of pop culture as we know it , ” he says , “ even though people say it is . ”

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .
voters decide its payback time having just received their january paychecks and seen what was missing , voters in the northwestern state of lower saxony and the central state of hesse obviously decided to deliver a message to the german chancellor .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .
the election now adds six seats to their 35-seat majority .
however , it is in the conciliation committee that the red-green coalition will face the sharpest winds coming from the opposition .
until the elections , the government had a slim majority of one vote .
now , following sunday 's victory , both sides have the exact number of votes in a commitee which is essential to the solving of disputes over new laws , and at present , for the realisation of the government 's reforms . members of the chrisitian democratic union and its bavarian-based sister party , the christian social union , vowed they would take advantage of their new power .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .
voters decide its payback time having just received their january paychecks and seen what was missing , voters in the northwestern state of lower saxony and the central state of hesse obviously decided to deliver a message to the german chancellor .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.02.2003 schröder pounded in two state elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his re-election as premier in hesse with conservative counterpart in lower saxony , christian wulff -lrb- right -rrb- germany 's opposition christian democrats dealt a severe setback to chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats in two states on sunday .
even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .
voters decide its payback time having just received their january paychecks and seen what was missing , voters in the northwestern state of lower saxony and the central state of hesse obviously decided to deliver a message to the german chancellor .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .
the election now adds six seats to their 35-seat majority .
however , it is in the conciliation committee that the red-green coalition will face the sharpest winds coming from the opposition .
until the elections , the government had a slim majority of one vote .
now , following sunday 's victory , both sides have the exact number of votes in a commitee which is essential to the solving of disputes over new laws , and at present , for the realisation of the government 's reforms . members of the chrisitian democratic union and its bavarian-based sister party , the christian social union , vowed they would take advantage of their new power .
" i think we now will be able to force through a change of political direction , " said edmund stoiber , the head of the christian social union and the union 's parties chancellor candidate in the 2002 elections . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de support for social democrats hits historic low with two important regional elections due at the start of february , germany 's social democrats are staring a possible humbling defeat full in the face after support for the party dropped to an historic low on friday .

the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .
instead , the german presidency will likely focus on the other trouble spots in the world - from the ivory coast to palestine - that will determine the day-to-day business of the security council until guinea takes over the role on march 1 . rainer sütfeld send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , iraq and the united nations a complete dossier of germany 's role in the united nations and its official positions regarding the iraq conflict .

the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .

but a forestry project supported by gtz is helping to restore the ecological balance . the central province of the island of sri lanka has been producing world famous brands of tea for over a century .
after kenya , sri lanka is the largest exporter of tea in the world .
last year , more than a billion tonnes of tea from the island entered the world market .
but the success of sri lanka ’ s tea market has come at a cost .
over the past 50 years , thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared for tea cultivation .
the deforestation has led to a serious environmental imbalance and a shortage of firewood for around a million people employed in the plantations .
restoring the balance with the help of the german development agency gtz , the sri lankan government and the asian development bank , several plantation companies have managed to stem the tide of environmental destruction .
in 1999 , gtz launched the sri lanka-german estate forest and water resources development project , to promote sustainable forestry and the balanced use of water resources in sri lanka 's tea plantations .
the benefits of the € 2 million project have been significant .
as well as boosting the companies ' profits , the scheme has had a positive impact on the environment .
and the lives of the plantation workers have greatly improved .
environmental impact so far , twelve plantation companies have participated in the forestry program , which now covers an area of 100,000 ha .
the companies have begun planting trees in areas where tea is not grown , helping to reduce erosion and improving the micro-climate .
forestry is essential to maintaining an ecological balance in the plantations , according to ernie daniel , a plantation management expert .
" if you look at the plantation sector at the moment you will see there is very little forest cover around those areas now , " daniel told dw radio 's ravi prasad .
" systemised forestry can lead to an increased canopy cover , which reduces soil erosion and the run-off of water during heavy rains . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea plantation in nuwara eliya , sri lankan hill country .
added value as well as benefitting the environment , the forestry project ensures a regular supply of timber and firewood for the workers .
it has also provided a windfall for the plantation companies which have diversified into the commercial timber business .
those companies that joined the project early have already begun harvesting and selling wood from timber factories which operate side-by-side with the tea factories .
changing attitudes the project was intially resisted by managers and workers who were sceptical that growing trees in plantations would benefit them .
many workers feared that forestry would mean reduced tea cultivation and their livelihood would be damaged .
but when the timber was harvested , the workers began to feel the financial benefits , says nishantha wickremesinghe , the general manager of udupusselawa plantations .
" wood being available on the estate , the workers don ’ t have to trek miles and miles to find wood for their homes .
so their productivity improves .
and when their productivity goes up , their income earning capacity goes up , " explains wickremesinghe .
the plantation workers also take part in the havesting , and some have been trained to work at the timber factories to clean the harvested timber , providing them with an extra source of income .

" i supervised the logging of trees , like i do here in the plantations and was paid almost the same amount that i get there , anthony says .
" my income has doubled . "
quality of life for over a million workers like anthony and his family , the forestry project has improved their quality of life .
the women are now no longer forced to spend several hours each evening after completing a full day 's work , searching for dwindling supplies of firewood for cooking .
with improved living conditions , the plantation workers now have more time for social activities .
at one plantation , the workers have rebuilt a hindu temple using timber that could not be sold .
they now gather at the temple every day for evening prayers .

" systemised forestry can lead to an increased canopy cover , which reduces soil erosion and the run-off of water during heavy rains . "

added value as well as benefitting the environment , the forestry project ensures a regular supply of timber and firewood for the workers .
it has also provided a windfall for the plantation companies which have diversified into the commercial timber business .
those companies that joined the project early have already begun harvesting and selling wood from timber factories which operate side-by-side with the tea factories .
changing attitudes the project was intially resisted by managers and workers who were sceptical that growing trees in plantations would benefit them .
many workers feared that forestry would mean reduced tea cultivation and their livelihood would be damaged .
but when the timber was harvested , the workers began to feel the financial benefits , says nishantha wickremesinghe , the general manager of udupusselawa plantations .
" wood being available on the estate , the workers don ’ t have to trek miles and miles to find wood for their homes .
so their productivity improves .
and when their productivity goes up , their income earning capacity goes up , " explains wickremesinghe .
the plantation workers also take part in the havesting , and some have been trained to work at the timber factories to clean the harvested timber , providing them with an extra source of income .

but a forestry project supported by gtz is helping to restore the ecological balance . the central province of the island of sri lanka has been producing world famous brands of tea for over a century .
after kenya , sri lanka is the largest exporter of tea in the world .
last year , more than a billion tonnes of tea from the island entered the world market .
but the success of sri lanka ’ s tea market has come at a cost .
over the past 50 years , thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared for tea cultivation .
the deforestation has led to a serious environmental imbalance and a shortage of firewood for around a million people employed in the plantations .
restoring the balance with the help of the german development agency gtz , the sri lankan government and the asian development bank , several plantation companies have managed to stem the tide of environmental destruction .
in 1999 , gtz launched the sri lanka-german estate forest and water resources development project , to promote sustainable forestry and the balanced use of water resources in sri lanka 's tea plantations .
the benefits of the € 2 million project have been significant .
as well as boosting the companies ' profits , the scheme has had a positive impact on the environment .
and the lives of the plantation workers have greatly improved .
environmental impact so far , twelve plantation companies have participated in the forestry program , which now covers an area of 100,000 ha .
the companies have begun planting trees in areas where tea is not grown , helping to reduce erosion and improving the micro-climate .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .
voters decide its payback time having just received their january paychecks and seen what was missing , voters in the northwestern state of lower saxony and the central state of hesse obviously decided to deliver a message to the german chancellor .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .
the election now adds six seats to their 35-seat majority .
however , it is in the conciliation committee that the red-green coalition will face the sharpest winds coming from the opposition .
until the elections , the government had a slim majority of one vote .
now , following sunday 's victory , both sides have the exact number of votes in a commitee which is essential to the solving of disputes over new laws , and at present , for the realisation of the government 's reforms . members of the chrisitian democratic union and its bavarian-based sister party , the christian social union , vowed they would take advantage of their new power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.02.2003 germany takes over security council presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place at the roundtable : germany takes over presidency of the un security council as president of the un security council this month , germany will set the agenda for meetings that could decide if war breaks out against iraq .
the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .
instead , the german presidency will likely focus on the other trouble spots in the world - from the ivory coast to palestine - that will determine the day-to-day business of the security council until guinea takes over the role on march 1 . rainer sütfeld send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , iraq and the united nations a complete dossier of germany 's role in the united nations and its official positions regarding the iraq conflict .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .

will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”
next came “ popstars , ” which spawned the bands no angels and bro ’ sis , continuing presences at the top of the german charts .
now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .
each week during the show ’ s month-long pilot run the winner will go home with € 5,000 -lrb- $ 5,379 -rrb- . but those of you bored with leggy blond teenagers , desperate for fame and singing kylie cover versions , need not fear .
germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .
just the job for those dark winter evenings . especially since withdrawal symptoms may abound after the excitement over germany ’ s search for a superstar finally subsides .
with the final just weeks away , the favorite , 20-year-old gracia , was voted out in the sixth round on saturday evening . tears and more tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an evening which oddly mirrored an episode in the british version of the show , 17- year-old daniel k. sobbed uncontrollably as fellow bavarian gracia baur -lrb- “ who was like a sister to me ” -rrb- had to leave .
in britain , it was 16-year-old gareth gates who broke down on live television , when his pop idol friend and colleague , 17-year-old zoe birkett - also from his home county - was voted off the show in the penultimate round of the competition . but whilst the performers are in tears , the businessmen certainly aren ’ t crying .
" superstar , " like “ popstars ” and “ big brother ” before it , is a ratings hit , with audiences of 10 million regularly tuning in .
the show ’ s broadcaster , rtl - which broadcast the other shows in germany too - is currently the leading channel in the country .
figures for january reveal that the rtl has a market share of 19.6 percent . the single brought out by the eleven " superstar " finalists , entitled “ we have a dream ” - and continuing with the lyrics “ music is our life ” - is number one in the german charts for the fourth week .
not even eminem ’ s hit song “ lose yourself ” from the film “ 8 mile ” could nudge it off the top spot . german " popstars " band still going strong and unlike hear ’ say , the band created by the uk “ popstars ” program , which broke up after less than two years in the limelight , teutonic girl group no angels and its successors from the same show , bro ’ sis , are still going strong . “ the trick with both no angels and bro ’ sis is that they continually develop , ” hannes ross , music critic at stern magazine told dw-world .
no angels ’ first cd sold well anyway , as was expected , but with the second they proved they could actually write songs too .
and now , by releasing a swing album , they ’ ve latched onto an older consumer group .
now the 50-somethings are buying their records as well , ” ross said . as to " superstar , " ross reckons the show ’ s success has nothing to do with the recession that germany is currently suffering , a theory touted by much of the german press . " ' superstar ' would have been a success even if germany had been having a huge boom .
it has nothing to do with escapism in the midst of recession .
i don ’ t believe such theories , " he told dw-world .
" the show ’ s secret is that it ’ s three shows in one .
firstly , it ’ s a music show .
then , it ’ s a big saturday night entertainment show .
and thirdly , it ’ s reality tv : the audience gets the excitement of voting people off . ” although germany is still crazy about reality tv , whether pop culture shows like “ superstar ” will eventually wear thin here is uncertain . ross believes shows like " superstar " and " big brother " will be on german screens for a long while yet .
“ i don ’ t think this is the end of pop culture as we know it , ” he says , “ even though people say it is . ”
in which case , by the time the " superstar " finale is broadcast on march 8 fans of german high culture may start to think its time to leave the country . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links deutschland sucht den superstar web site of the rtl " pop idol " show -lrb- in german -rrb- 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .
instead , the german presidency will likely focus on the other trouble spots in the world - from the ivory coast to palestine - that will determine the day-to-day business of the security council until guinea takes over the role on march 1 . rainer sütfeld send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , iraq and the united nations a complete dossier of germany 's role in the united nations and its official positions regarding the iraq conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.02.2003 german shopping trend mixes the great with the small großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to shop around - as long as its near , and open late despite germany 's trailing economy , and an increasing slump in retail sales , one sector of the retail industry is thriving : the small corner shop .
german shoppers are setting a new trend - so-called " hybrid " shopping . when it comes to shopping for the daily evening meal , germans are showing increasingly diverging consumer habits . with the current economic slump and a steady decline in retail sales , german shopping habits are changing - away from the sole weekly or monthly big shop at the supermarket to a more erratic way of consumption .
the society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- in nürnberg has noticed that german consumers no longer solely rely on supermarkets for their sustenance .
instead , increasing amounts of so-called " hybrid shoppers " are combining supermarket visits with trips to smaller food retailers , petrol stations and vendors in railway stations .
" the percentage of hybrid shoppers within the population appears to be getting larger , " said wolfgang twardawa from the society of consumer research in the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
shoppers head to smaller stores despite higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to shop around - as long as its near , and open late for market psychologists , the trend of " hybrid shopping " is a new development .
this new behavior does not seem to be based purely on the economic situation in germany , as many smaller outlets , including petrol station kiosks , tend to be more expensive than discount supermarkets like aldi , lidl and penny markt .
so , is it a matter of pure convenience ?
the statistics suggest so .
after a period where convenience stores have had to cope with a 2.5 percent sales shrinkage and many closed as a result , custom in small stores has increased : claudia gaspar , also of the gfk , said " every fifth german now uses a combination of the stores on offer ; local budget stores , small shops and fast food outlets , " .
small family-run stores , known in germany as " tante emma läden " - aunt emma shops , are benefiting greatly from the buying habits of these new " hybrid shoppers " .
these shoppers , who may pick up a yogurt from the supermarket on their way to work , are the same people who will buy food for the evening from the nearest corner shop or outlet - places that normally stay open a lot longer than regular supermarkets .
boom time is when supermarkets are closed " kiosks and petrol stations are getting the big sales during the classic commuter times , in the early morning and the early evening , " said suzanne eicholz-klein from bonn enterprise consultants bbe .
one success story of the growing boom is that of um 's eck , a franchise of small stores that was created to fight the squeeze of the bigger chains .
started in the dark days of small business during 1999 in the southern german town of ochsenhausen , the franchise now boasts 120 branches across the country .
" the idea is that the customers come back to the local and personal ... and keep coming back , " said um 's eck sales chief gebhard voltenauer in the report in die zeit .
it seems that germans are not only buying increasing amounts of items on their shopping lists from smaller outlets and petrol stations but are also buying ready-to-eat meals from these stores .
fast food restaurants beware - petroleum company aral has moved into fourth place in the german take-away league behind such big hitters as mcdonalds , burger king and the german fish outlet nordsee .
fast food , snacks and videos boost aral sales fuel sales aside , aral 's retail business is now worth around two million euro a year -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- with its petrol stations not only being an alternative to the usual fast food outlet but also the first stop in the morning as an alternative to breakfast at home .
in the last year , 150 million bread rolls were sold from petrol stations in germany .
add the business that is attracted by having over two thousand cash machines on forecourts across the country and the fact that some outlets hire videos to go with the chips and coke , it becomes clearer why a trip to the petrol station is featuring more heavily in consumers ' behavior .
in fact , the increasing presence of aral in the fast food charts is indicative of another trend that 's pulling the germans away from traditional shopping habits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.02.2003 germany takes over security council presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place at the roundtable : germany takes over presidency of the un security council as president of the un security council this month , germany will set the agenda for meetings that could decide if war breaks out against iraq .
the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.02.2003 germany takes over security council presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place at the roundtable : germany takes over presidency of the un security council as president of the un security council this month , germany will set the agenda for meetings that could decide if war breaks out against iraq .
the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .

the spokesman , walter lindner , made the statement in response to an article in the süddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper reported monday that the german government was refusing to supply the missiles because of its anti-war position .
during the 1991 persian gulf war , germany supplied the missiles to turkey .
scientology granted tax-free status the scientology church , the target of government monitoring in germany , has been granted tax-free status within the country , the church announced on monday .
officials made the decision based on a tax treaty between germany and the united states , where the church has tax-exempt status .
the ruling covers license fees the church receives for information and training films .
until now , the church has paid a 25 percent tax on the income .
that money will now be refunded .
critics consider scientology to be a money-hungry , unscrupulous operation .
its activities are monitored in 15 of germany 's 16 states by the country 's domestic intelligence service .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .
voters decide its payback time having just received their january paychecks and seen what was missing , voters in the northwestern state of lower saxony and the central state of hesse obviously decided to deliver a message to the german chancellor .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .
the election now adds six seats to their 35-seat majority .
however , it is in the conciliation committee that the red-green coalition will face the sharpest winds coming from the opposition .
until the elections , the government had a slim majority of one vote .
now , following sunday 's victory , both sides have the exact number of votes in a commitee which is essential to the solving of disputes over new laws , and at present , for the realisation of the government 's reforms . members of the chrisitian democratic union and its bavarian-based sister party , the christian social union , vowed they would take advantage of their new power .

will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”
next came “ popstars , ” which spawned the bands no angels and bro ’ sis , continuing presences at the top of the german charts .
now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .
each week during the show ’ s month-long pilot run the winner will go home with € 5,000 -lrb- $ 5,379 -rrb- . but those of you bored with leggy blond teenagers , desperate for fame and singing kylie cover versions , need not fear .
germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .
just the job for those dark winter evenings . especially since withdrawal symptoms may abound after the excitement over germany ’ s search for a superstar finally subsides .
with the final just weeks away , the favorite , 20-year-old gracia , was voted out in the sixth round on saturday evening . tears and more tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an evening which oddly mirrored an episode in the british version of the show , 17- year-old daniel k. sobbed uncontrollably as fellow bavarian gracia baur -lrb- “ who was like a sister to me ” -rrb- had to leave .
in britain , it was 16-year-old gareth gates who broke down on live television , when his pop idol friend and colleague , 17-year-old zoe birkett - also from his home county - was voted off the show in the penultimate round of the competition . but whilst the performers are in tears , the businessmen certainly aren ’ t crying .
" superstar , " like “ popstars ” and “ big brother ” before it , is a ratings hit , with audiences of 10 million regularly tuning in .
the show ’ s broadcaster , rtl - which broadcast the other shows in germany too - is currently the leading channel in the country .
figures for january reveal that the rtl has a market share of 19.6 percent . the single brought out by the eleven " superstar " finalists , entitled “ we have a dream ” - and continuing with the lyrics “ music is our life ” - is number one in the german charts for the fourth week .

no angels ’ first cd sold well anyway , as was expected , but with the second they proved they could actually write songs too .

it has nothing to do with escapism in the midst of recession .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .
voters decide its payback time having just received their january paychecks and seen what was missing , voters in the northwestern state of lower saxony and the central state of hesse obviously decided to deliver a message to the german chancellor .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .
voters decide its payback time having just received their january paychecks and seen what was missing , voters in the northwestern state of lower saxony and the central state of hesse obviously decided to deliver a message to the german chancellor .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .
the election now adds six seats to their 35-seat majority .
however , it is in the conciliation committee that the red-green coalition will face the sharpest winds coming from the opposition .
until the elections , the government had a slim majority of one vote .
now , following sunday 's victory , both sides have the exact number of votes in a commitee which is essential to the solving of disputes over new laws , and at present , for the realisation of the government 's reforms . members of the chrisitian democratic union and its bavarian-based sister party , the christian social union , vowed they would take advantage of their new power .
" i think we now will be able to force through a change of political direction , " said edmund stoiber , the head of the christian social union and the union 's parties chancellor candidate in the 2002 elections . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de support for social democrats hits historic low with two important regional elections due at the start of february , germany 's social democrats are staring a possible humbling defeat full in the face after support for the party dropped to an historic low on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.02.2003 germany takes over security council presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place at the roundtable : germany takes over presidency of the un security council as president of the un security council this month , germany will set the agenda for meetings that could decide if war breaks out against iraq .
the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .
instead , the german presidency will likely focus on the other trouble spots in the world - from the ivory coast to palestine - that will determine the day-to-day business of the security council until guinea takes over the role on march 1 . rainer sütfeld send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , iraq and the united nations a complete dossier of germany 's role in the united nations and its official positions regarding the iraq conflict .

the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .
instead , the german presidency will likely focus on the other trouble spots in the world - from the ivory coast to palestine - that will determine the day-to-day business of the security council until guinea takes over the role on march 1 . rainer sütfeld send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , iraq and the united nations a complete dossier of germany 's role in the united nations and its official positions regarding the iraq conflict .

german shoppers are setting a new trend - so-called " hybrid " shopping . when it comes to shopping for the daily evening meal , germans are showing increasingly diverging consumer habits . with the current economic slump and a steady decline in retail sales , german shopping habits are changing - away from the sole weekly or monthly big shop at the supermarket to a more erratic way of consumption .
the society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- in nürnberg has noticed that german consumers no longer solely rely on supermarkets for their sustenance .
instead , increasing amounts of so-called " hybrid shoppers " are combining supermarket visits with trips to smaller food retailers , petrol stations and vendors in railway stations .
" the percentage of hybrid shoppers within the population appears to be getting larger , " said wolfgang twardawa from the society of consumer research in the german weekly newspaper die zeit .

this new behavior does not seem to be based purely on the economic situation in germany , as many smaller outlets , including petrol station kiosks , tend to be more expensive than discount supermarkets like aldi , lidl and penny markt .
so , is it a matter of pure convenience ?
the statistics suggest so .
after a period where convenience stores have had to cope with a 2.5 percent sales shrinkage and many closed as a result , custom in small stores has increased : claudia gaspar , also of the gfk , said " every fifth german now uses a combination of the stores on offer ; local budget stores , small shops and fast food outlets , " .
small family-run stores , known in germany as " tante emma läden " - aunt emma shops , are benefiting greatly from the buying habits of these new " hybrid shoppers " .
these shoppers , who may pick up a yogurt from the supermarket on their way to work , are the same people who will buy food for the evening from the nearest corner shop or outlet - places that normally stay open a lot longer than regular supermarkets .
boom time is when supermarkets are closed " kiosks and petrol stations are getting the big sales during the classic commuter times , in the early morning and the early evening , " said suzanne eicholz-klein from bonn enterprise consultants bbe .
one success story of the growing boom is that of um 's eck , a franchise of small stores that was created to fight the squeeze of the bigger chains .
started in the dark days of small business during 1999 in the southern german town of ochsenhausen , the franchise now boasts 120 branches across the country .
" the idea is that the customers come back to the local and personal ... and keep coming back , " said um 's eck sales chief gebhard voltenauer in the report in die zeit .
it seems that germans are not only buying increasing amounts of items on their shopping lists from smaller outlets and petrol stations but are also buying ready-to-eat meals from these stores .
fast food restaurants beware - petroleum company aral has moved into fourth place in the german take-away league behind such big hitters as mcdonalds , burger king and the german fish outlet nordsee .
fast food , snacks and videos boost aral sales fuel sales aside , aral 's retail business is now worth around two million euro a year -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- with its petrol stations not only being an alternative to the usual fast food outlet but also the first stop in the morning as an alternative to breakfast at home .
in the last year , 150 million bread rolls were sold from petrol stations in germany .
add the business that is attracted by having over two thousand cash machines on forecourts across the country and the fact that some outlets hire videos to go with the chips and coke , it becomes clearer why a trip to the petrol station is featuring more heavily in consumers ' behavior .
in fact , the increasing presence of aral in the fast food charts is indicative of another trend that 's pulling the germans away from traditional shopping habits .
the numbers of people preferring take-away food continues to rise year on year .
estimates suggest that figures for 2002 will show that the amount of money spent on fast food has almost doubled since 1991 , taking spending across germany to 21.5 billion euro .
even with decelerated growth , germans are still expected to spend 25.6 billion euro on take-away food in 2010 .

german shoppers are setting a new trend - so-called " hybrid " shopping . when it comes to shopping for the daily evening meal , germans are showing increasingly diverging consumer habits . with the current economic slump and a steady decline in retail sales , german shopping habits are changing - away from the sole weekly or monthly big shop at the supermarket to a more erratic way of consumption .
the society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- in nürnberg has noticed that german consumers no longer solely rely on supermarkets for their sustenance .
instead , increasing amounts of so-called " hybrid shoppers " are combining supermarket visits with trips to smaller food retailers , petrol stations and vendors in railway stations .
" the percentage of hybrid shoppers within the population appears to be getting larger , " said wolfgang twardawa from the society of consumer research in the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
shoppers head to smaller stores despite higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to shop around - as long as its near , and open late for market psychologists , the trend of " hybrid shopping " is a new development .
this new behavior does not seem to be based purely on the economic situation in germany , as many smaller outlets , including petrol station kiosks , tend to be more expensive than discount supermarkets like aldi , lidl and penny markt .
so , is it a matter of pure convenience ?
the statistics suggest so .
after a period where convenience stores have had to cope with a 2.5 percent sales shrinkage and many closed as a result , custom in small stores has increased : claudia gaspar , also of the gfk , said " every fifth german now uses a combination of the stores on offer ; local budget stores , small shops and fast food outlets , " .
small family-run stores , known in germany as " tante emma läden " - aunt emma shops , are benefiting greatly from the buying habits of these new " hybrid shoppers " .
these shoppers , who may pick up a yogurt from the supermarket on their way to work , are the same people who will buy food for the evening from the nearest corner shop or outlet - places that normally stay open a lot longer than regular supermarkets .
boom time is when supermarkets are closed " kiosks and petrol stations are getting the big sales during the classic commuter times , in the early morning and the early evening , " said suzanne eicholz-klein from bonn enterprise consultants bbe .
one success story of the growing boom is that of um 's eck , a franchise of small stores that was created to fight the squeeze of the bigger chains .
started in the dark days of small business during 1999 in the southern german town of ochsenhausen , the franchise now boasts 120 branches across the country .

will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”
next came “ popstars , ” which spawned the bands no angels and bro ’ sis , continuing presences at the top of the german charts .
now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .
each week during the show ’ s month-long pilot run the winner will go home with € 5,000 -lrb- $ 5,379 -rrb- . but those of you bored with leggy blond teenagers , desperate for fame and singing kylie cover versions , need not fear .
germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .
just the job for those dark winter evenings . especially since withdrawal symptoms may abound after the excitement over germany ’ s search for a superstar finally subsides .
with the final just weeks away , the favorite , 20-year-old gracia , was voted out in the sixth round on saturday evening . tears and more tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an evening which oddly mirrored an episode in the british version of the show , 17- year-old daniel k. sobbed uncontrollably as fellow bavarian gracia baur -lrb- “ who was like a sister to me ” -rrb- had to leave .

" superstar , " like “ popstars ” and “ big brother ” before it , is a ratings hit , with audiences of 10 million regularly tuning in .
the show ’ s broadcaster , rtl - which broadcast the other shows in germany too - is currently the leading channel in the country .
figures for january reveal that the rtl has a market share of 19.6 percent . the single brought out by the eleven " superstar " finalists , entitled “ we have a dream ” - and continuing with the lyrics “ music is our life ” - is number one in the german charts for the fourth week .

now the 50-somethings are buying their records as well , ” ross said . as to " superstar , " ross reckons the show ’ s success has nothing to do with the recession that germany is currently suffering , a theory touted by much of the german press . " ' superstar ' would have been a success even if germany had been having a huge boom .
it has nothing to do with escapism in the midst of recession .
i don ’ t believe such theories , " he told dw-world .
" the show ’ s secret is that it ’ s three shows in one .
firstly , it ’ s a music show .
then , it ’ s a big saturday night entertainment show .
and thirdly , it ’ s reality tv : the audience gets the excitement of voting people off . ” although germany is still crazy about reality tv , whether pop culture shows like “ superstar ” will eventually wear thin here is uncertain . ross believes shows like " superstar " and " big brother " will be on german screens for a long while yet .
“ i don ’ t think this is the end of pop culture as we know it , ” he says , “ even though people say it is . ”
in which case , by the time the " superstar " finale is broadcast on march 8 fans of german high culture may start to think its time to leave the country . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links deutschland sucht den superstar web site of the rtl " pop idol " show -lrb- in german -rrb- 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .
instead , the german presidency will likely focus on the other trouble spots in the world - from the ivory coast to palestine - that will determine the day-to-day business of the security council until guinea takes over the role on march 1 . rainer sütfeld send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , iraq and the united nations a complete dossier of germany 's role in the united nations and its official positions regarding the iraq conflict .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .
voters decide its payback time having just received their january paychecks and seen what was missing , voters in the northwestern state of lower saxony and the central state of hesse obviously decided to deliver a message to the german chancellor .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .
the election now adds six seats to their 35-seat majority .
however , it is in the conciliation committee that the red-green coalition will face the sharpest winds coming from the opposition .
until the elections , the government had a slim majority of one vote .
now , following sunday 's victory , both sides have the exact number of votes in a commitee which is essential to the solving of disputes over new laws , and at present , for the realisation of the government 's reforms . members of the chrisitian democratic union and its bavarian-based sister party , the christian social union , vowed they would take advantage of their new power .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .

in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.02.2003 germany takes over security council presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place at the roundtable : germany takes over presidency of the un security council as president of the un security council this month , germany will set the agenda for meetings that could decide if war breaks out against iraq .
the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .
instead , the german presidency will likely focus on the other trouble spots in the world - from the ivory coast to palestine - that will determine the day-to-day business of the security council until guinea takes over the role on march 1 . rainer sütfeld send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , iraq and the united nations a complete dossier of germany 's role in the united nations and its official positions regarding the iraq conflict .

will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”
next came “ popstars , ” which spawned the bands no angels and bro ’ sis , continuing presences at the top of the german charts .
now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .
each week during the show ’ s month-long pilot run the winner will go home with € 5,000 -lrb- $ 5,379 -rrb- . but those of you bored with leggy blond teenagers , desperate for fame and singing kylie cover versions , need not fear .
germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .
just the job for those dark winter evenings . especially since withdrawal symptoms may abound after the excitement over germany ’ s search for a superstar finally subsides .
with the final just weeks away , the favorite , 20-year-old gracia , was voted out in the sixth round on saturday evening . tears and more tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an evening which oddly mirrored an episode in the british version of the show , 17- year-old daniel k. sobbed uncontrollably as fellow bavarian gracia baur -lrb- “ who was like a sister to me ” -rrb- had to leave .
in britain , it was 16-year-old gareth gates who broke down on live television , when his pop idol friend and colleague , 17-year-old zoe birkett - also from his home county - was voted off the show in the penultimate round of the competition . but whilst the performers are in tears , the businessmen certainly aren ’ t crying .
" superstar , " like “ popstars ” and “ big brother ” before it , is a ratings hit , with audiences of 10 million regularly tuning in .
the show ’ s broadcaster , rtl - which broadcast the other shows in germany too - is currently the leading channel in the country .
figures for january reveal that the rtl has a market share of 19.6 percent . the single brought out by the eleven " superstar " finalists , entitled “ we have a dream ” - and continuing with the lyrics “ music is our life ” - is number one in the german charts for the fourth week .
not even eminem ’ s hit song “ lose yourself ” from the film “ 8 mile ” could nudge it off the top spot . german " popstars " band still going strong and unlike hear ’ say , the band created by the uk “ popstars ” program , which broke up after less than two years in the limelight , teutonic girl group no angels and its successors from the same show , bro ’ sis , are still going strong . “ the trick with both no angels and bro ’ sis is that they continually develop , ” hannes ross , music critic at stern magazine told dw-world .
no angels ’ first cd sold well anyway , as was expected , but with the second they proved they could actually write songs too .
and now , by releasing a swing album , they ’ ve latched onto an older consumer group .
now the 50-somethings are buying their records as well , ” ross said . as to " superstar , " ross reckons the show ’ s success has nothing to do with the recession that germany is currently suffering , a theory touted by much of the german press . " ' superstar ' would have been a success even if germany had been having a huge boom .
it has nothing to do with escapism in the midst of recession .
i don ’ t believe such theories , " he told dw-world .
" the show ’ s secret is that it ’ s three shows in one .
firstly , it ’ s a music show .
then , it ’ s a big saturday night entertainment show .
and thirdly , it ’ s reality tv : the audience gets the excitement of voting people off . ” although germany is still crazy about reality tv , whether pop culture shows like “ superstar ” will eventually wear thin here is uncertain . ross believes shows like " superstar " and " big brother " will be on german screens for a long while yet .
“ i don ’ t think this is the end of pop culture as we know it , ” he says , “ even though people say it is . ”
in which case , by the time the " superstar " finale is broadcast on march 8 fans of german high culture may start to think its time to leave the country . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links deutschland sucht den superstar web site of the rtl " pop idol " show -lrb- in german -rrb- 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”

now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .

germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .

germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .
just the job for those dark winter evenings . especially since withdrawal symptoms may abound after the excitement over germany ’ s search for a superstar finally subsides .

german shoppers are setting a new trend - so-called " hybrid " shopping . when it comes to shopping for the daily evening meal , germans are showing increasingly diverging consumer habits . with the current economic slump and a steady decline in retail sales , german shopping habits are changing - away from the sole weekly or monthly big shop at the supermarket to a more erratic way of consumption .
the society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- in nürnberg has noticed that german consumers no longer solely rely on supermarkets for their sustenance .
instead , increasing amounts of so-called " hybrid shoppers " are combining supermarket visits with trips to smaller food retailers , petrol stations and vendors in railway stations .
" the percentage of hybrid shoppers within the population appears to be getting larger , " said wolfgang twardawa from the society of consumer research in the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
shoppers head to smaller stores despite higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to shop around - as long as its near , and open late for market psychologists , the trend of " hybrid shopping " is a new development .
this new behavior does not seem to be based purely on the economic situation in germany , as many smaller outlets , including petrol station kiosks , tend to be more expensive than discount supermarkets like aldi , lidl and penny markt .
so , is it a matter of pure convenience ?
the statistics suggest so .
after a period where convenience stores have had to cope with a 2.5 percent sales shrinkage and many closed as a result , custom in small stores has increased : claudia gaspar , also of the gfk , said " every fifth german now uses a combination of the stores on offer ; local budget stores , small shops and fast food outlets , " .
small family-run stores , known in germany as " tante emma läden " - aunt emma shops , are benefiting greatly from the buying habits of these new " hybrid shoppers " .
these shoppers , who may pick up a yogurt from the supermarket on their way to work , are the same people who will buy food for the evening from the nearest corner shop or outlet - places that normally stay open a lot longer than regular supermarkets .
boom time is when supermarkets are closed " kiosks and petrol stations are getting the big sales during the classic commuter times , in the early morning and the early evening , " said suzanne eicholz-klein from bonn enterprise consultants bbe .
one success story of the growing boom is that of um 's eck , a franchise of small stores that was created to fight the squeeze of the bigger chains .
started in the dark days of small business during 1999 in the southern german town of ochsenhausen , the franchise now boasts 120 branches across the country .
" the idea is that the customers come back to the local and personal ... and keep coming back , " said um 's eck sales chief gebhard voltenauer in the report in die zeit .
it seems that germans are not only buying increasing amounts of items on their shopping lists from smaller outlets and petrol stations but are also buying ready-to-eat meals from these stores .
fast food restaurants beware - petroleum company aral has moved into fourth place in the german take-away league behind such big hitters as mcdonalds , burger king and the german fish outlet nordsee .
fast food , snacks and videos boost aral sales fuel sales aside , aral 's retail business is now worth around two million euro a year -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- with its petrol stations not only being an alternative to the usual fast food outlet but also the first stop in the morning as an alternative to breakfast at home .
in the last year , 150 million bread rolls were sold from petrol stations in germany .
add the business that is attracted by having over two thousand cash machines on forecourts across the country and the fact that some outlets hire videos to go with the chips and coke , it becomes clearer why a trip to the petrol station is featuring more heavily in consumers ' behavior .
in fact , the increasing presence of aral in the fast food charts is indicative of another trend that 's pulling the germans away from traditional shopping habits .
the numbers of people preferring take-away food continues to rise year on year .
estimates suggest that figures for 2002 will show that the amount of money spent on fast food has almost doubled since 1991 , taking spending across germany to 21.5 billion euro .
even with decelerated growth , germans are still expected to spend 25.6 billion euro on take-away food in 2010 .

german shoppers are setting a new trend - so-called " hybrid " shopping . when it comes to shopping for the daily evening meal , germans are showing increasingly diverging consumer habits . with the current economic slump and a steady decline in retail sales , german shopping habits are changing - away from the sole weekly or monthly big shop at the supermarket to a more erratic way of consumption .
the society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- in nürnberg has noticed that german consumers no longer solely rely on supermarkets for their sustenance .
instead , increasing amounts of so-called " hybrid shoppers " are combining supermarket visits with trips to smaller food retailers , petrol stations and vendors in railway stations .
" the percentage of hybrid shoppers within the population appears to be getting larger , " said wolfgang twardawa from the society of consumer research in the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
shoppers head to smaller stores despite higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to shop around - as long as its near , and open late for market psychologists , the trend of " hybrid shopping " is a new development .
this new behavior does not seem to be based purely on the economic situation in germany , as many smaller outlets , including petrol station kiosks , tend to be more expensive than discount supermarkets like aldi , lidl and penny markt .
so , is it a matter of pure convenience ?
the statistics suggest so .
after a period where convenience stores have had to cope with a 2.5 percent sales shrinkage and many closed as a result , custom in small stores has increased : claudia gaspar , also of the gfk , said " every fifth german now uses a combination of the stores on offer ; local budget stores , small shops and fast food outlets , " .
small family-run stores , known in germany as " tante emma läden " - aunt emma shops , are benefiting greatly from the buying habits of these new " hybrid shoppers " .
these shoppers , who may pick up a yogurt from the supermarket on their way to work , are the same people who will buy food for the evening from the nearest corner shop or outlet - places that normally stay open a lot longer than regular supermarkets .
boom time is when supermarkets are closed " kiosks and petrol stations are getting the big sales during the classic commuter times , in the early morning and the early evening , " said suzanne eicholz-klein from bonn enterprise consultants bbe .
one success story of the growing boom is that of um 's eck , a franchise of small stores that was created to fight the squeeze of the bigger chains .
started in the dark days of small business during 1999 in the southern german town of ochsenhausen , the franchise now boasts 120 branches across the country .
" the idea is that the customers come back to the local and personal ... and keep coming back , " said um 's eck sales chief gebhard voltenauer in the report in die zeit .
it seems that germans are not only buying increasing amounts of items on their shopping lists from smaller outlets and petrol stations but are also buying ready-to-eat meals from these stores .
fast food restaurants beware - petroleum company aral has moved into fourth place in the german take-away league behind such big hitters as mcdonalds , burger king and the german fish outlet nordsee .
fast food , snacks and videos boost aral sales fuel sales aside , aral 's retail business is now worth around two million euro a year -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- with its petrol stations not only being an alternative to the usual fast food outlet but also the first stop in the morning as an alternative to breakfast at home .
in the last year , 150 million bread rolls were sold from petrol stations in germany .
add the business that is attracted by having over two thousand cash machines on forecourts across the country and the fact that some outlets hire videos to go with the chips and coke , it becomes clearer why a trip to the petrol station is featuring more heavily in consumers ' behavior .
in fact , the increasing presence of aral in the fast food charts is indicative of another trend that 's pulling the germans away from traditional shopping habits .
the numbers of people preferring take-away food continues to rise year on year .
estimates suggest that figures for 2002 will show that the amount of money spent on fast food has almost doubled since 1991 , taking spending across germany to 21.5 billion euro .
even with decelerated growth , germans are still expected to spend 25.6 billion euro on take-away food in 2010 .

but a forestry project supported by gtz is helping to restore the ecological balance . the central province of the island of sri lanka has been producing world famous brands of tea for over a century .
after kenya , sri lanka is the largest exporter of tea in the world .
last year , more than a billion tonnes of tea from the island entered the world market .
but the success of sri lanka ’ s tea market has come at a cost .
over the past 50 years , thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared for tea cultivation .
the deforestation has led to a serious environmental imbalance and a shortage of firewood for around a million people employed in the plantations .
restoring the balance with the help of the german development agency gtz , the sri lankan government and the asian development bank , several plantation companies have managed to stem the tide of environmental destruction .
in 1999 , gtz launched the sri lanka-german estate forest and water resources development project , to promote sustainable forestry and the balanced use of water resources in sri lanka 's tea plantations .
the benefits of the € 2 million project have been significant .
as well as boosting the companies ' profits , the scheme has had a positive impact on the environment .
and the lives of the plantation workers have greatly improved .
environmental impact so far , twelve plantation companies have participated in the forestry program , which now covers an area of 100,000 ha .
the companies have begun planting trees in areas where tea is not grown , helping to reduce erosion and improving the micro-climate .
forestry is essential to maintaining an ecological balance in the plantations , according to ernie daniel , a plantation management expert .
" if you look at the plantation sector at the moment you will see there is very little forest cover around those areas now , " daniel told dw radio 's ravi prasad .
" systemised forestry can lead to an increased canopy cover , which reduces soil erosion and the run-off of water during heavy rains . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea plantation in nuwara eliya , sri lankan hill country .
added value as well as benefitting the environment , the forestry project ensures a regular supply of timber and firewood for the workers .
it has also provided a windfall for the plantation companies which have diversified into the commercial timber business .
those companies that joined the project early have already begun harvesting and selling wood from timber factories which operate side-by-side with the tea factories .
changing attitudes the project was intially resisted by managers and workers who were sceptical that growing trees in plantations would benefit them .
many workers feared that forestry would mean reduced tea cultivation and their livelihood would be damaged .
but when the timber was harvested , the workers began to feel the financial benefits , says nishantha wickremesinghe , the general manager of udupusselawa plantations .
" wood being available on the estate , the workers don ’ t have to trek miles and miles to find wood for their homes .
so their productivity improves .
and when their productivity goes up , their income earning capacity goes up , " explains wickremesinghe .
the plantation workers also take part in the havesting , and some have been trained to work at the timber factories to clean the harvested timber , providing them with an extra source of income .

" i supervised the logging of trees , like i do here in the plantations and was paid almost the same amount that i get there , anthony says .
" my income has doubled . "
quality of life for over a million workers like anthony and his family , the forestry project has improved their quality of life .
the women are now no longer forced to spend several hours each evening after completing a full day 's work , searching for dwindling supplies of firewood for cooking .
with improved living conditions , the plantation workers now have more time for social activities .
at one plantation , the workers have rebuilt a hindu temple using timber that could not be sold .
they now gather at the temple every day for evening prayers .

but a forestry project supported by gtz is helping to restore the ecological balance . the central province of the island of sri lanka has been producing world famous brands of tea for over a century .
after kenya , sri lanka is the largest exporter of tea in the world .
last year , more than a billion tonnes of tea from the island entered the world market .
but the success of sri lanka ’ s tea market has come at a cost .
over the past 50 years , thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared for tea cultivation .
the deforestation has led to a serious environmental imbalance and a shortage of firewood for around a million people employed in the plantations .
restoring the balance with the help of the german development agency gtz , the sri lankan government and the asian development bank , several plantation companies have managed to stem the tide of environmental destruction .
in 1999 , gtz launched the sri lanka-german estate forest and water resources development project , to promote sustainable forestry and the balanced use of water resources in sri lanka 's tea plantations .
the benefits of the € 2 million project have been significant .
as well as boosting the companies ' profits , the scheme has had a positive impact on the environment .
and the lives of the plantation workers have greatly improved .
environmental impact so far , twelve plantation companies have participated in the forestry program , which now covers an area of 100,000 ha .
the companies have begun planting trees in areas where tea is not grown , helping to reduce erosion and improving the micro-climate .
forestry is essential to maintaining an ecological balance in the plantations , according to ernie daniel , a plantation management expert .
" if you look at the plantation sector at the moment you will see there is very little forest cover around those areas now , " daniel told dw radio 's ravi prasad .
" systemised forestry can lead to an increased canopy cover , which reduces soil erosion and the run-off of water during heavy rains . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea plantation in nuwara eliya , sri lankan hill country .
added value as well as benefitting the environment , the forestry project ensures a regular supply of timber and firewood for the workers .
it has also provided a windfall for the plantation companies which have diversified into the commercial timber business .
those companies that joined the project early have already begun harvesting and selling wood from timber factories which operate side-by-side with the tea factories .
changing attitudes the project was intially resisted by managers and workers who were sceptical that growing trees in plantations would benefit them .
many workers feared that forestry would mean reduced tea cultivation and their livelihood would be damaged .
but when the timber was harvested , the workers began to feel the financial benefits , says nishantha wickremesinghe , the general manager of udupusselawa plantations .
" wood being available on the estate , the workers don ’ t have to trek miles and miles to find wood for their homes .
so their productivity improves .
and when their productivity goes up , their income earning capacity goes up , " explains wickremesinghe .
the plantation workers also take part in the havesting , and some have been trained to work at the timber factories to clean the harvested timber , providing them with an extra source of income .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea-picker in sri lanka .
photo , ravi prasad anthony , a ‘ kandani ’ or supervisor for twenty years , says the forestry project has made a big difference for his family .
" with the timber factory set up by the plantation , we have been able to earn a lot more , " he says .
" i supervised the logging of trees , like i do here in the plantations and was paid almost the same amount that i get there , anthony says .
" my income has doubled . "
quality of life for over a million workers like anthony and his family , the forestry project has improved their quality of life .
the women are now no longer forced to spend several hours each evening after completing a full day 's work , searching for dwindling supplies of firewood for cooking .
with improved living conditions , the plantation workers now have more time for social activities .

german shoppers are setting a new trend - so-called " hybrid " shopping . when it comes to shopping for the daily evening meal , germans are showing increasingly diverging consumer habits . with the current economic slump and a steady decline in retail sales , german shopping habits are changing - away from the sole weekly or monthly big shop at the supermarket to a more erratic way of consumption .
the society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- in nürnberg has noticed that german consumers no longer solely rely on supermarkets for their sustenance .
instead , increasing amounts of so-called " hybrid shoppers " are combining supermarket visits with trips to smaller food retailers , petrol stations and vendors in railway stations .
" the percentage of hybrid shoppers within the population appears to be getting larger , " said wolfgang twardawa from the society of consumer research in the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
shoppers head to smaller stores despite higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to shop around - as long as its near , and open late for market psychologists , the trend of " hybrid shopping " is a new development .
this new behavior does not seem to be based purely on the economic situation in germany , as many smaller outlets , including petrol station kiosks , tend to be more expensive than discount supermarkets like aldi , lidl and penny markt .
so , is it a matter of pure convenience ?
the statistics suggest so .
after a period where convenience stores have had to cope with a 2.5 percent sales shrinkage and many closed as a result , custom in small stores has increased : claudia gaspar , also of the gfk , said " every fifth german now uses a combination of the stores on offer ; local budget stores , small shops and fast food outlets , " .
small family-run stores , known in germany as " tante emma läden " - aunt emma shops , are benefiting greatly from the buying habits of these new " hybrid shoppers " .
these shoppers , who may pick up a yogurt from the supermarket on their way to work , are the same people who will buy food for the evening from the nearest corner shop or outlet - places that normally stay open a lot longer than regular supermarkets .
boom time is when supermarkets are closed " kiosks and petrol stations are getting the big sales during the classic commuter times , in the early morning and the early evening , " said suzanne eicholz-klein from bonn enterprise consultants bbe .
one success story of the growing boom is that of um 's eck , a franchise of small stores that was created to fight the squeeze of the bigger chains .
started in the dark days of small business during 1999 in the southern german town of ochsenhausen , the franchise now boasts 120 branches across the country .
" the idea is that the customers come back to the local and personal ... and keep coming back , " said um 's eck sales chief gebhard voltenauer in the report in die zeit .
it seems that germans are not only buying increasing amounts of items on their shopping lists from smaller outlets and petrol stations but are also buying ready-to-eat meals from these stores .
fast food restaurants beware - petroleum company aral has moved into fourth place in the german take-away league behind such big hitters as mcdonalds , burger king and the german fish outlet nordsee .
fast food , snacks and videos boost aral sales fuel sales aside , aral 's retail business is now worth around two million euro a year -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- with its petrol stations not only being an alternative to the usual fast food outlet but also the first stop in the morning as an alternative to breakfast at home .
in the last year , 150 million bread rolls were sold from petrol stations in germany .
add the business that is attracted by having over two thousand cash machines on forecourts across the country and the fact that some outlets hire videos to go with the chips and coke , it becomes clearer why a trip to the petrol station is featuring more heavily in consumers ' behavior .
in fact , the increasing presence of aral in the fast food charts is indicative of another trend that 's pulling the germans away from traditional shopping habits .
the numbers of people preferring take-away food continues to rise year on year .
estimates suggest that figures for 2002 will show that the amount of money spent on fast food has almost doubled since 1991 , taking spending across germany to 21.5 billion euro .
even with decelerated growth , germans are still expected to spend 25.6 billion euro on take-away food in 2010 .

the spokesman , walter lindner , made the statement in response to an article in the süddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper reported monday that the german government was refusing to supply the missiles because of its anti-war position .
during the 1991 persian gulf war , germany supplied the missiles to turkey .

german shoppers are setting a new trend - so-called " hybrid " shopping . when it comes to shopping for the daily evening meal , germans are showing increasingly diverging consumer habits . with the current economic slump and a steady decline in retail sales , german shopping habits are changing - away from the sole weekly or monthly big shop at the supermarket to a more erratic way of consumption .
the society for consumer research -lrb- gfk -rrb- in nürnberg has noticed that german consumers no longer solely rely on supermarkets for their sustenance .
instead , increasing amounts of so-called " hybrid shoppers " are combining supermarket visits with trips to smaller food retailers , petrol stations and vendors in railway stations .
" the percentage of hybrid shoppers within the population appears to be getting larger , " said wolfgang twardawa from the society of consumer research in the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
shoppers head to smaller stores despite higher prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans like to shop around - as long as its near , and open late for market psychologists , the trend of " hybrid shopping " is a new development .
this new behavior does not seem to be based purely on the economic situation in germany , as many smaller outlets , including petrol station kiosks , tend to be more expensive than discount supermarkets like aldi , lidl and penny markt .
so , is it a matter of pure convenience ?
the statistics suggest so .
after a period where convenience stores have had to cope with a 2.5 percent sales shrinkage and many closed as a result , custom in small stores has increased : claudia gaspar , also of the gfk , said " every fifth german now uses a combination of the stores on offer ; local budget stores , small shops and fast food outlets , " .
small family-run stores , known in germany as " tante emma läden " - aunt emma shops , are benefiting greatly from the buying habits of these new " hybrid shoppers " .
these shoppers , who may pick up a yogurt from the supermarket on their way to work , are the same people who will buy food for the evening from the nearest corner shop or outlet - places that normally stay open a lot longer than regular supermarkets .
boom time is when supermarkets are closed " kiosks and petrol stations are getting the big sales during the classic commuter times , in the early morning and the early evening , " said suzanne eicholz-klein from bonn enterprise consultants bbe .
one success story of the growing boom is that of um 's eck , a franchise of small stores that was created to fight the squeeze of the bigger chains .
started in the dark days of small business during 1999 in the southern german town of ochsenhausen , the franchise now boasts 120 branches across the country .
" the idea is that the customers come back to the local and personal ... and keep coming back , " said um 's eck sales chief gebhard voltenauer in the report in die zeit .
it seems that germans are not only buying increasing amounts of items on their shopping lists from smaller outlets and petrol stations but are also buying ready-to-eat meals from these stores .
fast food restaurants beware - petroleum company aral has moved into fourth place in the german take-away league behind such big hitters as mcdonalds , burger king and the german fish outlet nordsee .
fast food , snacks and videos boost aral sales fuel sales aside , aral 's retail business is now worth around two million euro a year -lrb- $ 2.1 million -rrb- with its petrol stations not only being an alternative to the usual fast food outlet but also the first stop in the morning as an alternative to breakfast at home .
in the last year , 150 million bread rolls were sold from petrol stations in germany .
add the business that is attracted by having over two thousand cash machines on forecourts across the country and the fact that some outlets hire videos to go with the chips and coke , it becomes clearer why a trip to the petrol station is featuring more heavily in consumers ' behavior .
in fact , the increasing presence of aral in the fast food charts is indicative of another trend that 's pulling the germans away from traditional shopping habits .
the numbers of people preferring take-away food continues to rise year on year .
estimates suggest that figures for 2002 will show that the amount of money spent on fast food has almost doubled since 1991 , taking spending across germany to 21.5 billion euro .
even with decelerated growth , germans are still expected to spend 25.6 billion euro on take-away food in 2010 .

while consumers seem to be ignoring the economic situation in favor of convenience , the booming business of " tante emma " stores and fast food outlets are in direct contrast to recent news that recession-hit german consumers have reined in spending .

will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”
next came “ popstars , ” which spawned the bands no angels and bro ’ sis , continuing presences at the top of the german charts .
now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .
each week during the show ’ s month-long pilot run the winner will go home with € 5,000 -lrb- $ 5,379 -rrb- . but those of you bored with leggy blond teenagers , desperate for fame and singing kylie cover versions , need not fear .
germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .
just the job for those dark winter evenings . especially since withdrawal symptoms may abound after the excitement over germany ’ s search for a superstar finally subsides .
with the final just weeks away , the favorite , 20-year-old gracia , was voted out in the sixth round on saturday evening . tears and more tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an evening which oddly mirrored an episode in the british version of the show , 17- year-old daniel k. sobbed uncontrollably as fellow bavarian gracia baur -lrb- “ who was like a sister to me ” -rrb- had to leave .
in britain , it was 16-year-old gareth gates who broke down on live television , when his pop idol friend and colleague , 17-year-old zoe birkett - also from his home county - was voted off the show in the penultimate round of the competition . but whilst the performers are in tears , the businessmen certainly aren ’ t crying .
" superstar , " like “ popstars ” and “ big brother ” before it , is a ratings hit , with audiences of 10 million regularly tuning in .
the show ’ s broadcaster , rtl - which broadcast the other shows in germany too - is currently the leading channel in the country .
figures for january reveal that the rtl has a market share of 19.6 percent . the single brought out by the eleven " superstar " finalists , entitled “ we have a dream ” - and continuing with the lyrics “ music is our life ” - is number one in the german charts for the fourth week .
not even eminem ’ s hit song “ lose yourself ” from the film “ 8 mile ” could nudge it off the top spot . german " popstars " band still going strong and unlike hear ’ say , the band created by the uk “ popstars ” program , which broke up after less than two years in the limelight , teutonic girl group no angels and its successors from the same show , bro ’ sis , are still going strong . “ the trick with both no angels and bro ’ sis is that they continually develop , ” hannes ross , music critic at stern magazine told dw-world .
no angels ’ first cd sold well anyway , as was expected , but with the second they proved they could actually write songs too .
and now , by releasing a swing album , they ’ ve latched onto an older consumer group .
now the 50-somethings are buying their records as well , ” ross said . as to " superstar , " ross reckons the show ’ s success has nothing to do with the recession that germany is currently suffering , a theory touted by much of the german press . " ' superstar ' would have been a success even if germany had been having a huge boom .
it has nothing to do with escapism in the midst of recession .
i don ’ t believe such theories , " he told dw-world .
" the show ’ s secret is that it ’ s three shows in one .
firstly , it ’ s a music show .
then , it ’ s a big saturday night entertainment show .
and thirdly , it ’ s reality tv : the audience gets the excitement of voting people off . ” although germany is still crazy about reality tv , whether pop culture shows like “ superstar ” will eventually wear thin here is uncertain . ross believes shows like " superstar " and " big brother " will be on german screens for a long while yet .
“ i don ’ t think this is the end of pop culture as we know it , ” he says , “ even though people say it is . ”

the spokesman , walter lindner , made the statement in response to an article in the süddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper reported monday that the german government was refusing to supply the missiles because of its anti-war position .

scientology granted tax-free status the scientology church , the target of government monitoring in germany , has been granted tax-free status within the country , the church announced on monday .

the ruling covers license fees the church receives for information and training films .
until now , the church has paid a 25 percent tax on the income .
that money will now be refunded .
critics consider scientology to be a money-hungry , unscrupulous operation .

the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .

14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .

in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .
the election now adds six seats to their 35-seat majority .
however , it is in the conciliation committee that the red-green coalition will face the sharpest winds coming from the opposition .

the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .
voters decide its payback time having just received their january paychecks and seen what was missing , voters in the northwestern state of lower saxony and the central state of hesse obviously decided to deliver a message to the german chancellor .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .
the election now adds six seats to their 35-seat majority .
however , it is in the conciliation committee that the red-green coalition will face the sharpest winds coming from the opposition .
until the elections , the government had a slim majority of one vote .
now , following sunday 's victory , both sides have the exact number of votes in a commitee which is essential to the solving of disputes over new laws , and at present , for the realisation of the government 's reforms . members of the chrisitian democratic union and its bavarian-based sister party , the christian social union , vowed they would take advantage of their new power .
" i think we now will be able to force through a change of political direction , " said edmund stoiber , the head of the christian social union and the union 's parties chancellor candidate in the 2002 elections . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de support for social democrats hits historic low with two important regional elections due at the start of february , germany 's social democrats are staring a possible humbling defeat full in the face after support for the party dropped to an historic low on friday .

the spokesman , walter lindner , made the statement in response to an article in the süddeutsche zeitung .

will the germans ever tire of reality tv ? back in 2000 germany went mad over “ big brother . ”
next came “ popstars , ” which spawned the bands no angels and bro ’ sis , continuing presences at the top of the german charts .
now the excitement surrounding the final stages of the german version of “ pop idol ” - “ deutschland sucht den superstar ” -lrb- germany searches for its superstar -rrb- - has reached fever pitch .
reality tv in germany has never been so big .
so big , in fact , that even the public service broadcaster ard wants a piece of the action . tonight sees the launch of “ deutschlands talente ” -lrb- germany ’ s talents -rrb- , broadcast by ard .
germany ’ s most talented singers and entertainers are meant to perform in front of a live studio audience , which will then vote for its favorite .
each week during the show ’ s month-long pilot run the winner will go home with € 5,000 -lrb- $ 5,379 -rrb- . but those of you bored with leggy blond teenagers , desperate for fame and singing kylie cover versions , need not fear .
germany ’ s most talented , yet hitherto undiscovered comedians and “ gifted children ” will also have their chance , according to ard .
just the job for those dark winter evenings . especially since withdrawal symptoms may abound after the excitement over germany ’ s search for a superstar finally subsides .
with the final just weeks away , the favorite , 20-year-old gracia , was voted out in the sixth round on saturday evening . tears and more tears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an evening which oddly mirrored an episode in the british version of the show , 17- year-old daniel k. sobbed uncontrollably as fellow bavarian gracia baur -lrb- “ who was like a sister to me ” -rrb- had to leave .
in britain , it was 16-year-old gareth gates who broke down on live television , when his pop idol friend and colleague , 17-year-old zoe birkett - also from his home county - was voted off the show in the penultimate round of the competition . but whilst the performers are in tears , the businessmen certainly aren ’ t crying .
" superstar , " like “ popstars ” and “ big brother ” before it , is a ratings hit , with audiences of 10 million regularly tuning in .
the show ’ s broadcaster , rtl - which broadcast the other shows in germany too - is currently the leading channel in the country .
figures for january reveal that the rtl has a market share of 19.6 percent . the single brought out by the eleven " superstar " finalists , entitled “ we have a dream ” - and continuing with the lyrics “ music is our life ” - is number one in the german charts for the fourth week .
not even eminem ’ s hit song “ lose yourself ” from the film “ 8 mile ” could nudge it off the top spot . german " popstars " band still going strong and unlike hear ’ say , the band created by the uk “ popstars ” program , which broke up after less than two years in the limelight , teutonic girl group no angels and its successors from the same show , bro ’ sis , are still going strong . “ the trick with both no angels and bro ’ sis is that they continually develop , ” hannes ross , music critic at stern magazine told dw-world .
no angels ’ first cd sold well anyway , as was expected , but with the second they proved they could actually write songs too .
and now , by releasing a swing album , they ’ ve latched onto an older consumer group .
now the 50-somethings are buying their records as well , ” ross said . as to " superstar , " ross reckons the show ’ s success has nothing to do with the recession that germany is currently suffering , a theory touted by much of the german press . " ' superstar ' would have been a success even if germany had been having a huge boom .
it has nothing to do with escapism in the midst of recession .
i don ’ t believe such theories , " he told dw-world .
" the show ’ s secret is that it ’ s three shows in one .
firstly , it ’ s a music show .
then , it ’ s a big saturday night entertainment show .
and thirdly , it ’ s reality tv : the audience gets the excitement of voting people off . ” although germany is still crazy about reality tv , whether pop culture shows like “ superstar ” will eventually wear thin here is uncertain . ross believes shows like " superstar " and " big brother " will be on german screens for a long while yet .
“ i don ’ t think this is the end of pop culture as we know it , ” he says , “ even though people say it is . ”
in which case , by the time the " superstar " finale is broadcast on march 8 fans of german high culture may start to think its time to leave the country . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links deutschland sucht den superstar web site of the rtl " pop idol " show -lrb- in german -rrb- media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.02.2003 germany takes over security council presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place at the roundtable : germany takes over presidency of the un security council as president of the un security council this month , germany will set the agenda for meetings that could decide if war breaks out against iraq .
the first is set for wednesday . on saturday , germany officially took over the rotating presidency of the united nations security council for one month in new york .
but the work of germany 's un ambassador , gunter pleuger , does n't really begin in earnest until monday , when the un 's highest decision-making body sets its agenda for february .
from its first meeting this wednesday , the month is certain to present an array of difficult decisions for the security council 's members . on feb .
5 , u.s. secretary of state colin powell will present an intelligence report that washington says contains information about iraqi weapons of mass destruction while at the same time establishing links between baghdad and international terrorist groups .
iraq 's un ambassador , mohammed al-duri , has also made a request to speak before the council .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is scheduled to facilitate .
but wednesday is an exception .
normally , the job of overseeing security council meetings in february will be left up to germany 's representative on the security council , gunter pleuger .
but already , pleuger has been forced to yield some of his agenda-setting authority to the united states , which has sought to control the agenda on feb .
5 .
but pleuger has downplayed any significance that attempt may have .
" no agenda had been set for feb .
5 , " said pleuger .
" the americans also told us earlier it was their desire to hold this type of meeting on that day .
we consulted with the other members and the whole thing proceeded entirely as usual . "
a limited role germany joined the security council on jan .
1 as a non-permanent member for two years .
as a non-permanent member , germany has voting rights , but no veto power , even as the rotating president of the council .
the role is largely ceremonial and is thus limited almost entirely to organizational and management duties , and decision-making freedom is often only as big as the importance of the country holding the presidency .
that 's a lesson colombia 's un ambassador had to learn as a recent security council president .
after the council voted against releasing portions of the iraq weapons dossier , washington secured a copy and then only gave a fraction of the document to the members of the council that do n't share veto privileges .
a further example of germany 's limited power on the council is that foreign minister fischer must travel to new york in order to meet with chief un weapons inspector hans blix .
" you realize , of course , that foreign minister fischer will be one of eight or nine foreign ministers who will come to this meeting , so i 'm assuming this is going to be an important one , " pleuger said .
" it 's going to be the first meeting of the security council under the german presidency .
fischer himself will lead the meeting and what the result will be , we can only gauge on wednesday evening . "
finding unity in an interview , pleuger also played down the importance of his role and that of germany in the security council on the subject of iraq .
his main role in the position during february will be countless telephone calls , talks and lunches aimed at finding consensus between the 14 security council members on issues pertaining to world peace .
" this month is n't important because we have the chair , but rather because this month important political questions will be dealt with , and it 's possible that difficult decisions will have to be made , " pleuger said .
" we are seeking to lead the security council on the level expected of us - we want to set the agenda in a way so that negotiations lead to as much unity on the security council as possible . "
it 's a lofty goal , but other members of the security council think germany can pull it off .
" the president has to make sure the council works smoothly and i have no doubt that this will be the case of germany , " said stefan tafrov , bulgaria 's un ambassador .
a second iraq report despite the heavy duty lineup of cabinet ministers this wednesday , the most important appointment for the security council this month will likely be feb .
14 - the day the second report from blix and international atomic energy agency head mohammed elbaradei is to be delivered to the security council .
however , this has little significance for germany 's leadership of the security council considering that a decision over whether inspectors should be given more time or not will likely be determined by washington and not berlin .
it 's also unlikely that german chancellor gerhard schröder 's government will set the next date for any decision on iraq .
instead , the german presidency will likely focus on the other trouble spots in the world - from the ivory coast to palestine - that will determine the day-to-day business of the security council until guinea takes over the role on march 1 . rainer sütfeld send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , iraq and the united nations a complete dossier of germany 's role in the united nations and its official positions regarding the iraq conflict . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

even one of schröder 's top ministers thinks the government was to blame . german voters took their wrath out on the national government led by chancellor gerhard schröder on sunday , delivering devastating blows that drove his party out of power in his home state and gave the opposition christian democrats an absolute marjority in another .
schröder had nothing to say publicly after the vote on sunday .
but one of his top ministers , wolfgang clement , conceded that schröder 's government was to blame .
" we have made a bunch of mistakes , " said clement , the country 's economics and labor minister .
the election was held just over four months after schröder 's narrow re-election in september .
immediately afterwards , his standing began to plummet as state leaders in his party conducted an auction-like debate on tax increases with one speaker after another tossing out an idea .
as the year wore on , the government raised taxes for the country 's pension system , and many public health insurance companies boosted their premiums as well .
the increases were compounded by troubling reports about the government 's rising deficit , which raised the specter of further tax increases and fines imposed by the european union for breaches in the stability pact governing the euro .
voters decide its payback time having just received their january paychecks and seen what was missing , voters in the northwestern state of lower saxony and the central state of hesse obviously decided to deliver a message to the german chancellor .
in schröder 's home state of lower saxony , the social democrats were driven from office after 13 years in power in sunday 's elections , with the opposition christian democrats falling just one seat short of winning an absolute majority in the state assembly .
the social democrats , on the other hand , received only 33.4 percent of the vote , 14.5 percentage points less than 1998 , when schröder won an absolute majority on his way to becoming chancellor .
in hesse , christian democrat roland koch became the party 's first premier ever to win a re-election in a state .
this he did in fashion , winning an absolute majority of seats in the assembly .
the social democrats fell to a historic low , receiving just 29.1 percent of the vote , a drop of 10.3 percentage points from 1999 .
opposition gains national power for schröder , the election results are more than a simple loss of face .
they also give the countries ' two union opposition parties and the small free democratic party a stronger hand in shaping national policy .
the three parties can do so through their representation in the bundesrat , an assembly of representatives from germany 's 16 states that has a say on many national issues .
the election now adds six seats to their 35-seat majority .
however , it is in the conciliation committee that the red-green coalition will face the sharpest winds coming from the opposition .
until the elections , the government had a slim majority of one vote .
now , following sunday 's victory , both sides have the exact number of votes in a commitee which is essential to the solving of disputes over new laws , and at present , for the realisation of the government 's reforms . members of the chrisitian democratic union and its bavarian-based sister party , the christian social union , vowed they would take advantage of their new power .

but a forestry project supported by gtz is helping to restore the ecological balance . the central province of the island of sri lanka has been producing world famous brands of tea for over a century .
after kenya , sri lanka is the largest exporter of tea in the world .
last year , more than a billion tonnes of tea from the island entered the world market .
but the success of sri lanka ’ s tea market has come at a cost .
over the past 50 years , thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared for tea cultivation .
the deforestation has led to a serious environmental imbalance and a shortage of firewood for around a million people employed in the plantations .
restoring the balance with the help of the german development agency gtz , the sri lankan government and the asian development bank , several plantation companies have managed to stem the tide of environmental destruction .
in 1999 , gtz launched the sri lanka-german estate forest and water resources development project , to promote sustainable forestry and the balanced use of water resources in sri lanka 's tea plantations .
the benefits of the € 2 million project have been significant .
as well as boosting the companies ' profits , the scheme has had a positive impact on the environment .
and the lives of the plantation workers have greatly improved .
environmental impact so far , twelve plantation companies have participated in the forestry program , which now covers an area of 100,000 ha .
the companies have begun planting trees in areas where tea is not grown , helping to reduce erosion and improving the micro-climate .
forestry is essential to maintaining an ecological balance in the plantations , according to ernie daniel , a plantation management expert .
" if you look at the plantation sector at the moment you will see there is very little forest cover around those areas now , " daniel told dw radio 's ravi prasad .
" systemised forestry can lead to an increased canopy cover , which reduces soil erosion and the run-off of water during heavy rains . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea plantation in nuwara eliya , sri lankan hill country .
added value as well as benefitting the environment , the forestry project ensures a regular supply of timber and firewood for the workers .
it has also provided a windfall for the plantation companies which have diversified into the commercial timber business .
those companies that joined the project early have already begun harvesting and selling wood from timber factories which operate side-by-side with the tea factories .
changing attitudes the project was intially resisted by managers and workers who were sceptical that growing trees in plantations would benefit them .
many workers feared that forestry would mean reduced tea cultivation and their livelihood would be damaged .
but when the timber was harvested , the workers began to feel the financial benefits , says nishantha wickremesinghe , the general manager of udupusselawa plantations .
" wood being available on the estate , the workers don ’ t have to trek miles and miles to find wood for their homes .
so their productivity improves .
and when their productivity goes up , their income earning capacity goes up , " explains wickremesinghe .
the plantation workers also take part in the havesting , and some have been trained to work at the timber factories to clean the harvested timber , providing them with an extra source of income .

" i supervised the logging of trees , like i do here in the plantations and was paid almost the same amount that i get there , anthony says .
" my income has doubled . "
quality of life for over a million workers like anthony and his family , the forestry project has improved their quality of life .
the women are now no longer forced to spend several hours each evening after completing a full day 's work , searching for dwindling supplies of firewood for cooking .
with improved living conditions , the plantation workers now have more time for social activities .
at one plantation , the workers have rebuilt a hindu temple using timber that could not be sold .
they now gather at the temple every day for evening prayers .

but a forestry project supported by gtz is helping to restore the ecological balance . the central province of the island of sri lanka has been producing world famous brands of tea for over a century .
after kenya , sri lanka is the largest exporter of tea in the world .
last year , more than a billion tonnes of tea from the island entered the world market .
but the success of sri lanka ’ s tea market has come at a cost .
over the past 50 years , thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared for tea cultivation .
the deforestation has led to a serious environmental imbalance and a shortage of firewood for around a million people employed in the plantations .
restoring the balance with the help of the german development agency gtz , the sri lankan government and the asian development bank , several plantation companies have managed to stem the tide of environmental destruction .
in 1999 , gtz launched the sri lanka-german estate forest and water resources development project , to promote sustainable forestry and the balanced use of water resources in sri lanka 's tea plantations .
the benefits of the € 2 million project have been significant .
as well as boosting the companies ' profits , the scheme has had a positive impact on the environment .
and the lives of the plantation workers have greatly improved .
environmental impact so far , twelve plantation companies have participated in the forestry program , which now covers an area of 100,000 ha .
the companies have begun planting trees in areas where tea is not grown , helping to reduce erosion and improving the micro-climate .
forestry is essential to maintaining an ecological balance in the plantations , according to ernie daniel , a plantation management expert .
" if you look at the plantation sector at the moment you will see there is very little forest cover around those areas now , " daniel told dw radio 's ravi prasad .
" systemised forestry can lead to an increased canopy cover , which reduces soil erosion and the run-off of water during heavy rains . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea plantation in nuwara eliya , sri lankan hill country .
added value as well as benefitting the environment , the forestry project ensures a regular supply of timber and firewood for the workers .
it has also provided a windfall for the plantation companies which have diversified into the commercial timber business .
those companies that joined the project early have already begun harvesting and selling wood from timber factories which operate side-by-side with the tea factories .
changing attitudes the project was intially resisted by managers and workers who were sceptical that growing trees in plantations would benefit them .
many workers feared that forestry would mean reduced tea cultivation and their livelihood would be damaged .
but when the timber was harvested , the workers began to feel the financial benefits , says nishantha wickremesinghe , the general manager of udupusselawa plantations .
" wood being available on the estate , the workers don ’ t have to trek miles and miles to find wood for their homes .
so their productivity improves .
and when their productivity goes up , their income earning capacity goes up , " explains wickremesinghe .
the plantation workers also take part in the havesting , and some have been trained to work at the timber factories to clean the harvested timber , providing them with an extra source of income .

" with the timber factory set up by the plantation , we have been able to earn a lot more , " he says .
" i supervised the logging of trees , like i do here in the plantations and was paid almost the same amount that i get there , anthony says .
" my income has doubled . "
quality of life for over a million workers like anthony and his family , the forestry project has improved their quality of life .
the women are now no longer forced to spend several hours each evening after completing a full day 's work , searching for dwindling supplies of firewood for cooking .
with improved living conditions , the plantation workers now have more time for social activities .
at one plantation , the workers have rebuilt a hindu temple using timber that could not be sold .
they now gather at the temple every day for evening prayers .

but a forestry project supported by gtz is helping to restore the ecological balance . the central province of the island of sri lanka has been producing world famous brands of tea for over a century .
after kenya , sri lanka is the largest exporter of tea in the world .
last year , more than a billion tonnes of tea from the island entered the world market .
but the success of sri lanka ’ s tea market has come at a cost .
over the past 50 years , thousands of hectares of forest have been cleared for tea cultivation .
the deforestation has led to a serious environmental imbalance and a shortage of firewood for around a million people employed in the plantations .
restoring the balance with the help of the german development agency gtz , the sri lankan government and the asian development bank , several plantation companies have managed to stem the tide of environmental destruction .
in 1999 , gtz launched the sri lanka-german estate forest and water resources development project , to promote sustainable forestry and the balanced use of water resources in sri lanka 's tea plantations .
the benefits of the € 2 million project have been significant .
as well as boosting the companies ' profits , the scheme has had a positive impact on the environment .
and the lives of the plantation workers have greatly improved .
environmental impact so far , twelve plantation companies have participated in the forestry program , which now covers an area of 100,000 ha .
the companies have begun planting trees in areas where tea is not grown , helping to reduce erosion and improving the micro-climate .
forestry is essential to maintaining an ecological balance in the plantations , according to ernie daniel , a plantation management expert .
" if you look at the plantation sector at the moment you will see there is very little forest cover around those areas now , " daniel told dw radio 's ravi prasad .
" systemised forestry can lead to an increased canopy cover , which reduces soil erosion and the run-off of water during heavy rains . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tea plantation in nuwara eliya , sri lankan hill country .
added value as well as benefitting the environment , the forestry project ensures a regular supply of timber and firewood for the workers .
it has also provided a windfall for the plantation companies which have diversified into the commercial timber business .
those companies that joined the project early have already begun harvesting and selling wood from timber factories which operate side-by-side with the tea factories .
changing attitudes the project was intially resisted by managers and workers who were sceptical that growing trees in plantations would benefit them .
many workers feared that forestry would mean reduced tea cultivation and their livelihood would be damaged .
but when the timber was harvested , the workers began to feel the financial benefits , says nishantha wickremesinghe , the general manager of udupusselawa plantations .
" wood being available on the estate , the workers don ’ t have to trek miles and miles to find wood for their homes .
so their productivity improves .
and when their productivity goes up , their income earning capacity goes up , " explains wickremesinghe .
the plantation workers also take part in the havesting , and some have been trained to work at the timber factories to clean the harvested timber , providing them with an extra source of income .

quality of life for over a million workers like anthony and his family , the forestry project has improved their quality of life .
the women are now no longer forced to spend several hours each evening after completing a full day 's work , searching for dwindling supplies of firewood for cooking .

the spokesman , walter lindner , made the statement in response to an article in the süddeutsche zeitung .

staff at walker road primary hit on the idea that children might make better use of a foreign language if it was used to teach them part of their curriculum .
the philosophy stems from " immersion " teaching , something common in other parts of europe , but rarely employed in the uk .
the different approach , which started as a pilot scheme at the school in 2000 , saw french being taught at primary one level instead of waiting until year six .
language teaching " this proves that when an innovative approach is taken to learning - in this case language learning - the benefits come through as greater pupil confidence and greater pupil interest " cathy jamieson education minister in addition , the foreign language teachers insisted on speaking to pupils only in french .
and it was not just children in the classroom who got involved , their parents were also allowed into some lessons .
pupils from the school are now due to visit edinburgh on monday to tell cathy jamieson and her deputy nicol stephen - in french - how much they enjoy their lessons .
ms jamieson said : " this proves that when an innovative approach is taken to learning - in this case language learning - the benefits come through as greater pupil confidence and greater pupil interest .
" it 's good to celebrate one of the many success stories in language learning and teaching and i am pleased that good use is being made of scottish executive funding . "
financial help ms jamieson said the executive 's funding structure gave local councils and schools greater flexibility in the use of language funding .
" we are already supporting more than 20 innovative language projects , with room for more next year .
" we have also produced support materials for teachers , most significantly cd-roms in french , german , spanish and italian which will soon be available to every language teacher rather than one per school , " said ms jamieson .
the scottish executive is providing some financial support for the aberdeen project - 30 % of the costs in the first two years , rising to 50 % for this financial year and the next .
the executive increased the resources available to local authorities to support foreign language learning from £ 3.7m to £ 4.2m in the last financial year .
a spokeswoman said funding had been further increased to £ 4.7m for this and the next financial year .

the rout of gerhard schroeder 's party in its first electoral test since his narrow return to power last september attracts comment in germany , while czech papers ponder the post-havel interregnum .
plugging the gap ?
the leading russian daily izvestiya casts doubt on the national space agency 's confident assertion that russia stands to benefit from the loss of the us shuttle . "
the columbia tragedy puts the international space station 's existence under threat - and with it the russian space programme " nezavisimaya gazeta even agency sources acknowledge that the russian progress ships which ferry cargo to the international space station have a capacity of just 3-5 tonnes , compared with the columbia 's 100 tonnes , it notes .
" further comment , as they say , is superfluous , " it adds wryly .
the heavyweight nezavisimaya gazeta provides some anyway .
" the columbia tragedy puts the international space station 's existence under threat - and with it the russian space programme , which is geared principally to servicing the iss , " it says .
but two experts interviewed in the same newspaper are more optimistic about the future of manned space flight .
general yuri yashin , an ex-head of the presidential state technical commission , says russia and the us would suffer if they abandoned manned flights .
an end to space exploration , he believes , " would inflict great damage on the development not only of the space-rocket sector but of industry as a whole - ultimately , such a decision would halt the development of the military sector " .
lt-gen valeriy subbotin , deputy head of a space research institute , agrees that " machines will never replace human beings " but sounds a note of caution .
with a yearly budget of 8-10bn roubles -lrb- $ 251-314m -rrb- against nasa 's $ 14bn , " we ca n't develop our own manned programme independently " , he warns .
german rebuff to chancellor the weekend also spelt disaster for the party of german chancellor gerhard schroeder in sunday 's regional elections , the first since he was re-elected five months ago .
berlin 's der tagesspiegel says the spd 's defeat in hesse and lower saxony can not be understood in isolation from last september 's bitterly-contested general elections and the subsequent months of government turmoil . "
whether the voters like it or not , the coalition must break the logjam preventing reform " der tagesspiegel " of course this was an anti-schroeder election , " the paper says .
but whatever the voters ' exact reasons , it adds , the governing spd-green coalition must not use the result as an excuse to delay reform further .
" whether the voters like it or not , the coalition must break the logjam preventing reform .
it must finally and courageously drive forward a consistent policy of reforms , " it declares .
munich 's sueddeutsche zeitung says the opposition cdu has gained what it calls " triumphant victories " .
such protest votes are nothing new , " but their vehemence is " , it adds .
the more the voters back the right-of-centre opposition in regional elections , the paper says , the closer they come to achieving a two-thirds majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
" such a majority means : everything grinds to a halt in germany , " the paper says , explaining that the cdu / csu would be able to reject every law that the governing coalition managed to pass through the lower house .
hard act to follow one politician with no such worries is vaclav havel - but the departing czech president leaves a vacuum for the country 's press to mull over . "
a short period without a head of state is no problem for us , but it would be good if this period were not protracted " hospodarske noviny following parliament 's repeated failure to appoint a new president , part of his powers are to be assumed by prime minister vladimir spidla and parliament speaker lubomir zaoralek , reports lidove noviny , adding with some disquiet : " the concentration of powers in the hands of two men who have not been known for their openness will be all the more dangerous if this lasts for many months . "
the hospodarske noviny daily is in two minds , first declaring confidently that " a short period without a head of state is no problem for us " , before adding that " it would be good if this period were not protracted " .
another paper , mlada fronta dnes , is more confident , believing it is better to have no president than for a successor to be appointed in haste .
while it would be better to have a head of state in place with an iraq war and an eu membership referendum looming , it says , " we can easily wage a war and vote without him " .
little terrors back in russia , izvestiya highlights a rise in bomb threats to moscow schools .
the police have been called out on more than 550 false alarms this school year - and the local education authority has spotted a trend : " most calls come at the end of the quarter , when exams are starting , " a spokesman reveals .
the police have given heads some advice on deterring the hard core of 100 or so pupils who are costing the state up to 30,000 roubles per incident : all lessons missed during the evacuations will have to take place in the holidays and at weekends .
their teachers ' reaction to this suggestion is not disclosed .
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

cordelia salter-nour was an it expert for development projects in africa for more than 20 years before setting up eshopafrica.com.
she chose to branch out alone after becoming increasingly frustrated that the new technologies did not seem to benefit the poorest people - ordinary africans .
" if technology ca n't benefit the least advantaged members of society , including traditional african artisans , then it does n't have much value , " she says .
marketing for snobs surfers who stumble unawares across eshopafrica.com could be forgiven for thinking it is an outlandish kind of site .
it features , amongst other things , designer-made coffins in the shape of fish , aeroplanes or beer bottles , which are for sale at $ 1,000 .
but , unlikely as online coffin sales may seem , the site is specifically targeting people who want that kind of specialised and highly unusual product .
" i want to tap the snobbery market - the people who want to swap stories at dinner parties about the originality of their artefacts , " ms salter-nour says .
samuel 's success to feed the story-value of the crafts , her online shop is about to relaunch with detailed information about each individual craftsman and the underlying traditions behind the products .
those fish-shaped coffins , for example , come from the ga culture in ghana , where the coffin traditionally reflects how the deceased earned a living .
and samuel , the coffin carpenter , has been able to pay off his apprenticeship fees , thanks to his overseas sales .
ambitious displays in rome and paris later this year will again try to get specialist buyers on board .
fraud fears the site has , perhaps unsurprisingly , had its fair share of problems .
foremost among those is that taking credit card payments online is not an option for african businesses .
african banks are not yet up to the task , and internet credit card service providers usually require the business bank account to be held in the west .
" it 's unfair to demand that african markets open up to international market forces and then not give them access to banking facilities , " ms salter-nour says .
the situation has only been resolved by finding a somewhat unsatisfactory loop in the system - using her personal credit card account for business transactions .
as a westerner she had no problems getting the banking facility sorted .
fake threat the us market , meanwhile , has been unexpectedly difficult to crack .
it had been hoped that african americans , often keen to get back in touch with their roots , would be enthusiastic buyers .
but mass importers of cheaper african crafts can easily undersell eshopafrica.com by dealing in bulk - and are sometimes accused of paying unfair wages to the african craftsmen .
part of the ethos of the site includes abiding by a strict code of fair payment and ensuring there is no forced labour involved .
ms salter-nour also claims that many goods sold into the us market are actually chinese products made to look african .
money matters the website is not making money .
but that 's not what it 's all about , according to ms salter-nour .
software giants such as microsoft are in africa to make money , she says , targeting the richest of africans and selling them licences at the same price as they sell them to westerners .
but the purpose of eshopafrica.com is to create a viable business for african craftsmen .
and ms salter-nour wo n't be drawn with talk of sales targets and break-even dates .
she wants five african artisans a year to be able to create a sustainable business from selling their wares online .
" that 's the only goal . "

there is a self-sustaining desire right now to be optimistic brian moon , cambridge consultants until not long ago , the lack of sun , palm trees and sparkling skyscrapers was seen as a sign that europe 's biggest concentration of technology businesses could not last .
in fact , the peculiarities of cambridge 's " silicon fen " may have enabled it to ride out the global tech slump .
even - possibly - to thrive .
tricky , not tragic the past couple of years have been rough on cambridge , but not excessively so .
dr moon scents an upturn in the air " 2002 was a very difficult year , " says brian moon , chief executive of cambridge consultants , a technology development firm that was in at the birth of silicon fen in the early 1960s .
" our pipeline of leads and opportunities was not diminishing , but nor was it getting consummated .
" nothing was getting built , and we took that as an indicator that people were just treading water , waiting for something positive to happen . "
many firms shut down ; others , like chip maker arm holdings , the region 's biggest tech company , saw once-mighty shares tumble .
reasons to be cheerful could the worst be over already ?
many in cambridge think so .
cambridge was lucky enough not to get involved in all the fluff of the 1990s hermann hauser , amadeus capital " towards the end of last year , we started to see a slight pick-up in sales - and other tech firms started to do the same , " says dr moon .
" cambridge is a small place : if people are enthusiastic , it tends to rub off .
there is a sort of self-sustaining desire right now to be optimistic . "
indeed , the region seems to have emerged from the crisis more robust than before .
in 2000 , silicon fen was home to 1,550 hi-tech firms , employing some 44,000 people ; now , according to new figures from the greater cambridgeshire partnership -lrb- gcp -rrb- , a regional lobby group , there are 3,500 firms with 55,000 staff .
and despite its reliance on tech firms , the greater cambridge area has an annual output growth rate of almost 8 % - four times the national average .
critical mass some of this can be attributed to the sort of corporate mix cambridge attracts - fewer once-modish internet or software companies , more research-intensive firms in biosciences , medical technology and the like .
" cambridge was lucky enough not to get involved in all the fluff of the 1990s , " says hermann hauser , head of venture capital firm amadeus capital and another founding father of silicon fen .
this broader corporate base has helped achieve the sort of critical mass needed to anchor the region 's economy .
" we have built up a solid undergrowth of serial entrepreneurs - people who have succeeded in the past and prove it can be done , " says dr hauser .
" five years ago , we could not point to one cambridge company that had made a name on the global stage - now there are half a dozen . "
blowing their own trumpet silicon fen has also started to pour more effort into decidedly un-british boosterism .
at the gcp , director martin garratt says he has extended his conception of silicon fen across at least five counties , from stansted airport in the south to not far from peterborough in the north .
more importantly , the university is starting to take serious notice of the possibilities on its doorstep .
" until a couple of years ago , the university maintained a policy of benign neglect , " says dr hauser .
the two parties long worked in happily unstructured symbiosis : companies fed off the university 's top-class cadre of research scientists , while silicon fen provided a steady source of employment and enrichment .
the fact that the university remained airily laisser-faire , allowing staff to wander off into the business world without a qualm , actively helped silicon fen develop , dr hauser argues .
many other universities tried to control their academics ' business ventures , hoping to grab a slice of the action - in most cases only serving to stifle creativity .
trying harder that benign neglect is forming into something more active .
for years , cambridge colleges have sponsored innovation centres , and the university 's corporate liaison office has attempted to manage links between business and academe .
peter hiscocks wants to make business respectable now , the university is aiming to embed business savvy a litle deeper into the culture of cambridge - an institution known more for its expertise than its enterprise .
" five years ago , there was no teaching in entrepreneurship at cambridge , " says peter hiscocks , head of the university 's enterpreneurship centre .
" we want enterprise to be as relevant a career option for cambridge graduates as , say , the law .
and we 're making huge progress . "
the centre offers some 28 modular business courses to all cambridge students : its main business basics course has jumped from 120 students when it was launched three years to 620 this year .
trying too hard is it all too good to be true ?
certainly , things could go wrong yet .
in its eagerness to come over all business friendly , the university could blunder .
last september , keen to secure new sources of finance , it floated a plan to secure control of all intellectual property produced by its academics .
" it 's impossible to preserve academic freedom within a rigid framework of intellectual property enforcement , " fumes mike clark , a lecturer in the pathology department and a keen opponent of the scheme .
dr clark worries that the university will sell its intellectual property wholesale to an over-mighty bidder ; others are concerned that it will cost cambridge its creative edge .
" the university has so far had a policy to have no policy on intellectual property , " insists chris padfield , head of the corporate liaison office .
" the purpose of this move is to have a crystal clear situation , so both academics and venture capitalists know where they stand . "
transport crunch silicon fen may yet dodge this bullet : an outcry among dons has persuaded the authorities to refer the matter back to a committee .
tougher to avoid will be the region 's mounting misery over infrastructure .
rail links to anywhere but central london are patchy : " getting to heathrow from cambridge is pue hell , " sighs john hodgson , chief executive of cambridge silicon radio : cambridgeshire 's road to hell , at a quiet moment housing is pricey : the county is second only to leafy surrey in expense , forcing many cambridge workers to scurry off to cheaper huntingdon or beyond .
this , combined with rapid business expansion and the pedestrianisation of central cambridge , leaves many main roads woefully congested - especially the much-cursed a14 , a crucial route between the midlands and the east anglian coast .
" the situation is desperate : some of our brightest people are forced to spend two hours a day each way stuck in traffic , " says dr hauser .
stuck in a jam according to the gcp , £ 2bn will be required to bring the region 's infrastructure up to scratch .
planners point to the example of munich , where the city authorities invested an equivalent amount to facilitate a far smaller hi-tech zone .
the gcp is asking central government to stump up some £ 700m to help finance a raft of projects , arguing that the economic boost from silicon fen more than justifies the outlay .
the government has , in theory , approved improvements to the a14 , but the wheels of such projects move at a glacial pace .
in the meantime , the jams on the huntingdon road could be holding up more than just the traffic .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- yet more losses at ericsson bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point business contents : e-commerce -pipe- economy -pipe- market data monday , 3 february , 2003 , 08:36 gmt yet more losses at ericsson ericsson , the swedish firm that leads the global market for mobile network technology , has posted its seventh straight quarterly loss .
but the firm insisted that its performance was starting to stabilise , and that demand in its long-depressed market could pick up soon .
ericsson made a pre-tax loss of 2.2bn kronor -lrb- £ 157m ; $ 257m -rrb- during the last three months of 2002 , more than expected but much less than the 3.9bn-kronor loss recorded a year earlier .
its sales were down by 23 % during the quarter , and by 36 % for the year as a whole , hammered by collapsing investment among its mobile operator clients .
the rapid pace of cost-cutting - including the loss of another 7,100 jobs , or 10 % of its staff , during the quarter - meant the firm was on track to return to profitability this year , ericsson said .
' starting to stabilise ' the firm reiterated its view that the global mobile market would contract by 10 % this year .
but kurt hellstrom , ericsson 's chief executive , said he was cautiously optimistic .
" the sequential increase in sales and orders is more a factor of seasonality than an indication of a market recovery , " he said .
" however , with orders and sales at expected levels , good progress in our restructuring and positive cash flow , our fourth quarter results indicate that our business is beginning to stabilise . "
gloomy reaction its optimism notwithstanding , ericsson 's shares were down by 5.5 % shortly after the start of trading .
while some analysts sought comfort in the fact that the decline in sales was slowing , others insisted there was nothing else to cheer .
" there were no big surprises in the report , but it was a little worse than expected , " said urban ekelund from redeye .
" ericsson says that the worst is over , but i 'm not sure if you can trust that . "
ericsson 's results are seen as especially poor in relation to finnish rival nokia , which recently unveiled a doubling in net profits .
unlike ericsson , which focuses on the technology behind mobile networks , nokia concentrates mainly on handsets , which have seen a modest rebound in recent months .
