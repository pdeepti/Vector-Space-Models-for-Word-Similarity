politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 10.07.2003 european convention concludes work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing wraps up his work on europe 's first constitution .
with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .

with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .
the plan which was approved by german parliament will see one of two alternatives .
under one proposal , led by state secretary for culture christina weiss , the façade of the old hohenzollern palace will be reconstructed on three sides and the inside space entirely devoted for , as yet , unspecified cultural purposes .
that proposal calls for 80 percent funding by the german taxpayer , with the remaining 20 percent coming from private investors .
the second proposal is the brainchild of wilhelm von boddien , a hamburg businessman who has lobbied for more than a decade to re-build the building ’ s façade .
but his plan calls for the interior to be turned into two hotels and numerous plush offices .
unlike weiss ' , boddien has said 80 percent of the costs will be shouldered by private investors .
the remaining 20 percent will be publicly funded .
both projects will cost roughly € 600 million -lrb- $ 681 million . -rrb-
fighting to save erich 's lamp shop but opposition groups , who have been fighting for years to save the palace , are furious at what they see as a political decision by the government to sweep east german history under the carpet .
" it 's a huge waste of taxpayers money , " lieselotte schulz , chairman of the association for the preservation of the palace of the republic told deutsche welle .
the association , officially formed in 1997 , has since gathered thousands of signatures from german citizens who want to save " eric 's lamp shop " -lrb- called so because of the thousands of light fittings it had -rrb- .
many of the association 's supporters have fond memories of personal achievements , such as school graduations , which they celebrated in the palace of the republic .

no decision reached no final decision has been reached , according to the federal ministry for transport , buildings and living which looks after the building owned by the german state .
but even it admits that the re-building plans currently in the pipeline mean the fate of the palace is likely to have already been sealed .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .

with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .
do not respond by saying no . "
european official holiday the constitution aims to simplify the eu tangled law-making procedures , make institutions more transparent and install a full-time president of the european council and foreign minister , as well as allowing many more eu-wide policies to be approved with majority voting by the european council .
also entailed in the draft is an official motto of the eu , which will be " united in diversity , " an official eu song , which is to be beethoven 's " ode to joy " and an official holiday on may 9 to celebrate european unity .
however , before implementation , the draft constitution still has some hurdles to clear .
the final draft wo n't be completed until after an intergovernmental conference with current eu members and the 10 accession states , which takes place in october .
during the conference , governments will have another opportunity to make revisions to the draft .
but on thursday , giscard d 'estaing pled for restraint .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .

the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .
the plan which was approved by german parliament will see one of two alternatives .
under one proposal , led by state secretary for culture christina weiss , the façade of the old hohenzollern palace will be reconstructed on three sides and the inside space entirely devoted for , as yet , unspecified cultural purposes .
that proposal calls for 80 percent funding by the german taxpayer , with the remaining 20 percent coming from private investors .
the second proposal is the brainchild of wilhelm von boddien , a hamburg businessman who has lobbied for more than a decade to re-build the building ’ s façade .
but his plan calls for the interior to be turned into two hotels and numerous plush offices .
unlike weiss ' , boddien has said 80 percent of the costs will be shouldered by private investors .
the remaining 20 percent will be publicly funded .
both projects will cost roughly € 600 million -lrb- $ 681 million . -rrb-
fighting to save erich 's lamp shop but opposition groups , who have been fighting for years to save the palace , are furious at what they see as a political decision by the government to sweep east german history under the carpet .

no decision reached no final decision has been reached , according to the federal ministry for transport , buildings and living which looks after the building owned by the german state .
but even it admits that the re-building plans currently in the pipeline mean the fate of the palace is likely to have already been sealed .

the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .
the move is aimed at heading off a total ban on the controversial technology .
at the moment , a moratorium is in place , and since the beginning of the year , no eu money has been granted to scientists who create embryos to carry out the research .
european commission research spokesman fabio fabbi told reuters news agency " the research moratorium finishes at the end of 2003 and we want to have comprehensive guidelines in place . "
the proposals must now be approved by the council of ministers and the european parliament .
cure for disease vs. designer baby theories scientists say the research could produce cures for diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease , and that stem cells can be used to help restore the functions of damaged or failed organs .
opponents of the use of embryonic stem cells accuse scientists of " playing god " and say the new technology will inevitably be abused , resulting in human cloning and what they call " designer babies . "
the procedure is also controversial because the embryos are killed when the stem cells are harvested .
stem cells are considered the " master cells " in the human body .
embryonic cells can grow to form more than 200 different kinds of tissue .
one way of making them is what 's known as therapeutic cloning , effectively by creating embryos so that the stem cells can be used for therapeutic purposes .
adult stem cells are to be found in many organs , but their use for creating other kinds of tissue is limited .
however , their use for medical purposes is also far less controversial .
guidelines delayed by german resistance the new proposals were scheduled to be adopted last week , but those plans were thwarted by stiff resistance from some member states , notably germany .
last year , the german parliament passed a law banning the creation of human embryos or the use of human embryos created in germany for scientific purposes , but allowing the import of embryos in exceptional cases of " high-priority research goals . "
only embryos created before january 1 , 2002 , are allowed to be imported , and so far , licenses have been granted to just three scientists to do so .
the laws are similarly strict in france , spain , austria , ireland and denmark .
research into leftover embryos is legal in britain .
in germany , critics of the new guidelines argue that they are looser than domestic law , meaning german money paid into eu coffers could be used to fund research elsewhere in europe , while scientists who carried out the same research in germany would face criminal charges .

with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .
do not respond by saying no . "
european official holiday the constitution aims to simplify the eu tangled law-making procedures , make institutions more transparent and install a full-time president of the european council and foreign minister , as well as allowing many more eu-wide policies to be approved with majority voting by the european council .
also entailed in the draft is an official motto of the eu , which will be " united in diversity , " an official eu song , which is to be beethoven 's " ode to joy " and an official holiday on may 9 to celebrate european unity .
however , before implementation , the draft constitution still has some hurdles to clear .
the final draft wo n't be completed until after an intergovernmental conference with current eu members and the 10 accession states , which takes place in october .
during the conference , governments will have another opportunity to make revisions to the draft .
but on thursday , giscard d 'estaing pled for restraint .
" trying to change this consensus would run the risk of dislocating the whole thing , and historians might one day say that a great opportunity was missed , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .
the plan which was approved by german parliament will see one of two alternatives .
under one proposal , led by state secretary for culture christina weiss , the façade of the old hohenzollern palace will be reconstructed on three sides and the inside space entirely devoted for , as yet , unspecified cultural purposes .
that proposal calls for 80 percent funding by the german taxpayer , with the remaining 20 percent coming from private investors .
the second proposal is the brainchild of wilhelm von boddien , a hamburg businessman who has lobbied for more than a decade to re-build the building ’ s façade .
but his plan calls for the interior to be turned into two hotels and numerous plush offices .
unlike weiss ' , boddien has said 80 percent of the costs will be shouldered by private investors .

the days are numbered for the old volkswagen beetle .
on thursday the perennially popular love bug will roll off mexican production lines for the last time , bringing an end to over 70 years of automobile history . it ’ s unlikely any other car could have held onto its popularity for so long , providing generations with affordable and reliable transportation for over half a century as well as inspiring millions to embrace its plucky sense of " fahrvergnügen " .
then again the volkswagen beetle is no ordinary car .
first conceived in the early 1930s out of hitler ’ s desire to create an affordable " people ’ s car " -lrb- that ’ s volkswagen in german -rrb- , the chubby beetle went into mass production after world war ii .
since then some 22 million bug-eyed cars have rolled off the assembly lines , making it the most-built car ever .
but starting thursday when volkswagen rolls out one last special limited edition at its production plant in puebla , mexico , the love bug - an icon of 1960s flower power - will go the way of so many other popular and cherished relics of the era and find itself relegated to collectors ’ garages and museums .
adios to the beetle when the vw plant in mexico – the only one in the world still making the old-style beetle – launches its last retro edition on thursday it will be a slight intermission before the curtain finally falls on nearly 70 years of automobile history .
according to the german company , the beetle line will almost certainly be put to rest by the end of the month .
" there has never been a car like it , but i don ’ t think production will go beyond " the end of july , christine kuhlmeyer , head of corporate communications at volkswagen in mexico , told reuters .
the car ’ s fate was actually sealed last month , when the carmaker cited falling annual sales as the reason for the company ’ s decision to stop production of the original beetle .
" the beetle has been a hugely successful car for decades , it made volkswagen famous , " company spokesman fred bärbock told deutsche welle .
" but now we ’ ve had to recognize that demand for the original beetle has fallen . "
at the height of its production , the company made between 30,000 and 40,000 of the dome-shaped cars each year .
last year only 24,000 cars rolled out of the factory , a drop of nearly 50 percent compared to 2000 sales .

although the plant will continue producing vw cars , it ’ s the beetle they are most fond of .
since the wolfsburg mother factory moved its beetle production south-east of mexico city , an entire generation of factory workers have placed their hands on the cherished car they call " vocho . "

even the cathedral was sponsored by volkswagen .
" it ’ s a jewel for me .
the little bug has given my family prosperity , " said armando pasillas , 60 , describing to reuters how much he ’ ll miss the car .
having worked at the plant for 37 years , pasillas said he likes seeing the cars on the street because he knows they have all passed through his hands .
more importantly , the company has had a significant influence on the town ’ s economics .
the vw factory employs 14,000 workers who produce both the new beetle , the new beetle cabriolet and the jetta in addition to the original beetle .
together with auto parts suppliers , distributors and dealerships more than 60,000 townspeople have found work associated with volkswagen .

" but now we ’ ve had to recognize that demand for the original beetle has fallen . "
at the height of its production , the company made between 30,000 and 40,000 of the dome-shaped cars each year .
last year only 24,000 cars rolled out of the factory , a drop of nearly 50 percent compared to 2000 sales .

beetle city mexico the end of the original beetle will be especially hard felt in the mexican town of puebla , where the car has been manufactured since 1967 and for many has become like a member of the family .
although the plant will continue producing vw cars , it ’ s the beetle they are most fond of .
since the wolfsburg mother factory moved its beetle production south-east of mexico city , an entire generation of factory workers have placed their hands on the cherished car they call " vocho . "
and the car has become a veritable symbol of the town , appearing on all the street signs in the historic center .
even the cathedral was sponsored by volkswagen .
" it ’ s a jewel for me .
the little bug has given my family prosperity , " said armando pasillas , 60 , describing to reuters how much he ’ ll miss the car .
having worked at the plant for 37 years , pasillas said he likes seeing the cars on the street because he knows they have all passed through his hands .
more importantly , the company has had a significant influence on the town ’ s economics .
the vw factory employs 14,000 workers who produce both the new beetle , the new beetle cabriolet and the jetta in addition to the original beetle .
together with auto parts suppliers , distributors and dealerships more than 60,000 townspeople have found work associated with volkswagen .
despite shutting down production on the beetle , volkswagen has insisted that the puebla plant is still an important investment and manufacturing site .
" mexico remains , as it was before -lsb- stopping the original beetle -rsb- an important point of investment for us .
it is our only plant in the north american region , " bärbock said , adding that the company will move its entire production of the bora to puebla starting in 2005 .
although that ’ s good news for the puebla plant employees , it does little to console those who are mourning the end of the beetle . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .

the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .
the move is aimed at heading off a total ban on the controversial technology .
at the moment , a moratorium is in place , and since the beginning of the year , no eu money has been granted to scientists who create embryos to carry out the research .
european commission research spokesman fabio fabbi told reuters news agency " the research moratorium finishes at the end of 2003 and we want to have comprehensive guidelines in place . "
the proposals must now be approved by the council of ministers and the european parliament .
cure for disease vs. designer baby theories scientists say the research could produce cures for diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease , and that stem cells can be used to help restore the functions of damaged or failed organs .
opponents of the use of embryonic stem cells accuse scientists of " playing god " and say the new technology will inevitably be abused , resulting in human cloning and what they call " designer babies . "
the procedure is also controversial because the embryos are killed when the stem cells are harvested .
stem cells are considered the " master cells " in the human body .
embryonic cells can grow to form more than 200 different kinds of tissue .
one way of making them is what 's known as therapeutic cloning , effectively by creating embryos so that the stem cells can be used for therapeutic purposes .
adult stem cells are to be found in many organs , but their use for creating other kinds of tissue is limited .
however , their use for medical purposes is also far less controversial .
guidelines delayed by german resistance the new proposals were scheduled to be adopted last week , but those plans were thwarted by stiff resistance from some member states , notably germany .
last year , the german parliament passed a law banning the creation of human embryos or the use of human embryos created in germany for scientific purposes , but allowing the import of embryos in exceptional cases of " high-priority research goals . "
only embryos created before january 1 , 2002 , are allowed to be imported , and so far , licenses have been granted to just three scientists to do so .
the laws are similarly strict in france , spain , austria , ireland and denmark .
research into leftover embryos is legal in britain .
in germany , critics of the new guidelines argue that they are looser than domestic law , meaning german money paid into eu coffers could be used to fund research elsewhere in europe , while scientists who carried out the same research in germany would face criminal charges .

the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .

he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .
the move is aimed at heading off a total ban on the controversial technology .

european commission research spokesman fabio fabbi told reuters news agency " the research moratorium finishes at the end of 2003 and we want to have comprehensive guidelines in place . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.07.2003 making corporate culture more family-friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants companies to do more for female employees with children .
politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .
" time is the magic word for successful family policies , money is n't so much a factor , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de women 's issues a focus in german election campaign as election fever heats up in germany , political parties are wooing the substantial group of women voters with policies to help juggle kids and career .

the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .
the move is aimed at heading off a total ban on the controversial technology .
at the moment , a moratorium is in place , and since the beginning of the year , no eu money has been granted to scientists who create embryos to carry out the research .
european commission research spokesman fabio fabbi told reuters news agency " the research moratorium finishes at the end of 2003 and we want to have comprehensive guidelines in place . "
the proposals must now be approved by the council of ministers and the european parliament .
cure for disease vs. designer baby theories scientists say the research could produce cures for diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease , and that stem cells can be used to help restore the functions of damaged or failed organs .
opponents of the use of embryonic stem cells accuse scientists of " playing god " and say the new technology will inevitably be abused , resulting in human cloning and what they call " designer babies . "
the procedure is also controversial because the embryos are killed when the stem cells are harvested .
stem cells are considered the " master cells " in the human body .
embryonic cells can grow to form more than 200 different kinds of tissue .
one way of making them is what 's known as therapeutic cloning , effectively by creating embryos so that the stem cells can be used for therapeutic purposes .
adult stem cells are to be found in many organs , but their use for creating other kinds of tissue is limited .
however , their use for medical purposes is also far less controversial .
guidelines delayed by german resistance the new proposals were scheduled to be adopted last week , but those plans were thwarted by stiff resistance from some member states , notably germany .
last year , the german parliament passed a law banning the creation of human embryos or the use of human embryos created in germany for scientific purposes , but allowing the import of embryos in exceptional cases of " high-priority research goals . "
only embryos created before january 1 , 2002 , are allowed to be imported , and so far , licenses have been granted to just three scientists to do so .
the laws are similarly strict in france , spain , austria , ireland and denmark .
research into leftover embryos is legal in britain .
in germany , critics of the new guidelines argue that they are looser than domestic law , meaning german money paid into eu coffers could be used to fund research elsewhere in europe , while scientists who carried out the same research in germany would face criminal charges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn the german education and research minister , edelgard bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the social democrats , has come under fire for her role in the negotiations .
hiltrud breyer , a member of the european parliament and the green party , said the minister was not outspoken enough .
her fellow mep , peter liese , a christian democrat , said bulmahn did n't get involved in the process of drafting the guidelines early enough . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .
" time is the magic word for successful family policies , money is n't so much a factor , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de women 's issues a focus in german election campaign as election fever heats up in germany , political parties are wooing the substantial group of women voters with policies to help juggle kids and career .

with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .
do not respond by saying no . "
european official holiday the constitution aims to simplify the eu tangled law-making procedures , make institutions more transparent and install a full-time president of the european council and foreign minister , as well as allowing many more eu-wide policies to be approved with majority voting by the european council .

however , before implementation , the draft constitution still has some hurdles to clear .
the final draft wo n't be completed until after an intergovernmental conference with current eu members and the 10 accession states , which takes place in october .
during the conference , governments will have another opportunity to make revisions to the draft .

with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .
do not respond by saying no . "
european official holiday the constitution aims to simplify the eu tangled law-making procedures , make institutions more transparent and install a full-time president of the european council and foreign minister , as well as allowing many more eu-wide policies to be approved with majority voting by the european council .
also entailed in the draft is an official motto of the eu , which will be " united in diversity , " an official eu song , which is to be beethoven 's " ode to joy " and an official holiday on may 9 to celebrate european unity .
however , before implementation , the draft constitution still has some hurdles to clear .
the final draft wo n't be completed until after an intergovernmental conference with current eu members and the 10 accession states , which takes place in october .
during the conference , governments will have another opportunity to make revisions to the draft .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .
the plan which was approved by german parliament will see one of two alternatives .
under one proposal , led by state secretary for culture christina weiss , the façade of the old hohenzollern palace will be reconstructed on three sides and the inside space entirely devoted for , as yet , unspecified cultural purposes .
that proposal calls for 80 percent funding by the german taxpayer , with the remaining 20 percent coming from private investors .
the second proposal is the brainchild of wilhelm von boddien , a hamburg businessman who has lobbied for more than a decade to re-build the building ’ s façade .
but his plan calls for the interior to be turned into two hotels and numerous plush offices .
unlike weiss ' , boddien has said 80 percent of the costs will be shouldered by private investors .
the remaining 20 percent will be publicly funded .
both projects will cost roughly € 600 million -lrb- $ 681 million . -rrb-
fighting to save erich 's lamp shop but opposition groups , who have been fighting for years to save the palace , are furious at what they see as a political decision by the government to sweep east german history under the carpet .
" it 's a huge waste of taxpayers money , " lieselotte schulz , chairman of the association for the preservation of the palace of the republic told deutsche welle .
the association , officially formed in 1997 , has since gathered thousands of signatures from german citizens who want to save " eric 's lamp shop " -lrb- called so because of the thousands of light fittings it had -rrb- .
many of the association 's supporters have fond memories of personal achievements , such as school graduations , which they celebrated in the palace of the republic .

no decision reached no final decision has been reached , according to the federal ministry for transport , buildings and living which looks after the building owned by the german state .

the second proposal is the brainchild of wilhelm von boddien , a hamburg businessman who has lobbied for more than a decade to re-build the building ’ s façade .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .
the plan which was approved by german parliament will see one of two alternatives .
under one proposal , led by state secretary for culture christina weiss , the façade of the old hohenzollern palace will be reconstructed on three sides and the inside space entirely devoted for , as yet , unspecified cultural purposes .
that proposal calls for 80 percent funding by the german taxpayer , with the remaining 20 percent coming from private investors .
the second proposal is the brainchild of wilhelm von boddien , a hamburg businessman who has lobbied for more than a decade to re-build the building ’ s façade .
but his plan calls for the interior to be turned into two hotels and numerous plush offices .
unlike weiss ' , boddien has said 80 percent of the costs will be shouldered by private investors .
the remaining 20 percent will be publicly funded .
both projects will cost roughly € 600 million -lrb- $ 681 million . -rrb-
fighting to save erich 's lamp shop but opposition groups , who have been fighting for years to save the palace , are furious at what they see as a political decision by the government to sweep east german history under the carpet .
" it 's a huge waste of taxpayers money , " lieselotte schulz , chairman of the association for the preservation of the palace of the republic told deutsche welle .
the association , officially formed in 1997 , has since gathered thousands of signatures from german citizens who want to save " eric 's lamp shop " -lrb- called so because of the thousands of light fittings it had -rrb- .
many of the association 's supporters have fond memories of personal achievements , such as school graduations , which they celebrated in the palace of the republic .
" it 's the only building of it 's type in the world , " schulz says .
no decision reached no final decision has been reached , according to the federal ministry for transport , buildings and living which looks after the building owned by the german state .
but even it admits that the re-building plans currently in the pipeline mean the fate of the palace is likely to have already been sealed .
" obviously it -lrb- the palace -rrb- will have to be torn down if a reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace takes place , since the new building will stand on the same spot , " horst grothues , the government official in charge of the project , told deutsche welle . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de re-building berlin 's royal palace berlin was largely destroyed during world war ii .

the days are numbered for the old volkswagen beetle .
on thursday the perennially popular love bug will roll off mexican production lines for the last time , bringing an end to over 70 years of automobile history . it ’ s unlikely any other car could have held onto its popularity for so long , providing generations with affordable and reliable transportation for over half a century as well as inspiring millions to embrace its plucky sense of " fahrvergnügen " .
then again the volkswagen beetle is no ordinary car .
first conceived in the early 1930s out of hitler ’ s desire to create an affordable " people ’ s car " -lrb- that ’ s volkswagen in german -rrb- , the chubby beetle went into mass production after world war ii .
since then some 22 million bug-eyed cars have rolled off the assembly lines , making it the most-built car ever .
but starting thursday when volkswagen rolls out one last special limited edition at its production plant in puebla , mexico , the love bug - an icon of 1960s flower power - will go the way of so many other popular and cherished relics of the era and find itself relegated to collectors ’ garages and museums .
adios to the beetle when the vw plant in mexico – the only one in the world still making the old-style beetle – launches its last retro edition on thursday it will be a slight intermission before the curtain finally falls on nearly 70 years of automobile history .
according to the german company , the beetle line will almost certainly be put to rest by the end of the month .
" there has never been a car like it , but i don ’ t think production will go beyond " the end of july , christine kuhlmeyer , head of corporate communications at volkswagen in mexico , told reuters .
the car ’ s fate was actually sealed last month , when the carmaker cited falling annual sales as the reason for the company ’ s decision to stop production of the original beetle .
" the beetle has been a hugely successful car for decades , it made volkswagen famous , " company spokesman fred bärbock told deutsche welle .
" but now we ’ ve had to recognize that demand for the original beetle has fallen . "
at the height of its production , the company made between 30,000 and 40,000 of the dome-shaped cars each year .
last year only 24,000 cars rolled out of the factory , a drop of nearly 50 percent compared to 2000 sales .

beetle city mexico the end of the original beetle will be especially hard felt in the mexican town of puebla , where the car has been manufactured since 1967 and for many has become like a member of the family .
although the plant will continue producing vw cars , it ’ s the beetle they are most fond of .
since the wolfsburg mother factory moved its beetle production south-east of mexico city , an entire generation of factory workers have placed their hands on the cherished car they call " vocho . "
and the car has become a veritable symbol of the town , appearing on all the street signs in the historic center .
even the cathedral was sponsored by volkswagen .
" it ’ s a jewel for me .
the little bug has given my family prosperity , " said armando pasillas , 60 , describing to reuters how much he ’ ll miss the car .
having worked at the plant for 37 years , pasillas said he likes seeing the cars on the street because he knows they have all passed through his hands .
more importantly , the company has had a significant influence on the town ’ s economics .
the vw factory employs 14,000 workers who produce both the new beetle , the new beetle cabriolet and the jetta in addition to the original beetle .
together with auto parts suppliers , distributors and dealerships more than 60,000 townspeople have found work associated with volkswagen .
despite shutting down production on the beetle , volkswagen has insisted that the puebla plant is still an important investment and manufacturing site .
" mexico remains , as it was before -lsb- stopping the original beetle -rsb- an important point of investment for us .
it is our only plant in the north american region , " bärbock said , adding that the company will move its entire production of the bora to puebla starting in 2005 .

with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .
do not respond by saying no . "
european official holiday the constitution aims to simplify the eu tangled law-making procedures , make institutions more transparent and install a full-time president of the european council and foreign minister , as well as allowing many more eu-wide policies to be approved with majority voting by the european council .
also entailed in the draft is an official motto of the eu , which will be " united in diversity , " an official eu song , which is to be beethoven 's " ode to joy " and an official holiday on may 9 to celebrate european unity .
however , before implementation , the draft constitution still has some hurdles to clear .
the final draft wo n't be completed until after an intergovernmental conference with current eu members and the 10 accession states , which takes place in october .
during the conference , governments will have another opportunity to make revisions to the draft .
but on thursday , giscard d 'estaing pled for restraint .
" trying to change this consensus would run the risk of dislocating the whole thing , and historians might one day say that a great opportunity was missed , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .
" time is the magic word for successful family policies , money is n't so much a factor , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de women 's issues a focus in german election campaign as election fever heats up in germany , political parties are wooing the substantial group of women voters with policies to help juggle kids and career .

on thursday the perennially popular love bug will roll off mexican production lines for the last time , bringing an end to over 70 years of automobile history . it ’ s unlikely any other car could have held onto its popularity for so long , providing generations with affordable and reliable transportation for over half a century as well as inspiring millions to embrace its plucky sense of " fahrvergnügen " .

adios to the beetle when the vw plant in mexico – the only one in the world still making the old-style beetle – launches its last retro edition on thursday it will be a slight intermission before the curtain finally falls on nearly 70 years of automobile history .
according to the german company , the beetle line will almost certainly be put to rest by the end of the month .
" there has never been a car like it , but i don ’ t think production will go beyond " the end of july , christine kuhlmeyer , head of corporate communications at volkswagen in mexico , told reuters .

" the beetle has been a hugely successful car for decades , it made volkswagen famous , " company spokesman fred bärbock told deutsche welle .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .

with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .
do not respond by saying no . "
european official holiday the constitution aims to simplify the eu tangled law-making procedures , make institutions more transparent and install a full-time president of the european council and foreign minister , as well as allowing many more eu-wide policies to be approved with majority voting by the european council .
also entailed in the draft is an official motto of the eu , which will be " united in diversity , " an official eu song , which is to be beethoven 's " ode to joy " and an official holiday on may 9 to celebrate european unity .
however , before implementation , the draft constitution still has some hurdles to clear .
the final draft wo n't be completed until after an intergovernmental conference with current eu members and the 10 accession states , which takes place in october .
during the conference , governments will have another opportunity to make revisions to the draft .
but on thursday , giscard d 'estaing pled for restraint .
" trying to change this consensus would run the risk of dislocating the whole thing , and historians might one day say that a great opportunity was missed , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .
" time is the magic word for successful family policies , money is n't so much a factor , " she said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de women 's issues a focus in german election campaign as election fever heats up in germany , political parties are wooing the substantial group of women voters with policies to help juggle kids and career .

with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .
do not respond by saying no . "
european official holiday the constitution aims to simplify the eu tangled law-making procedures , make institutions more transparent and install a full-time president of the european council and foreign minister , as well as allowing many more eu-wide policies to be approved with majority voting by the european council .
also entailed in the draft is an official motto of the eu , which will be " united in diversity , " an official eu song , which is to be beethoven 's " ode to joy " and an official holiday on may 9 to celebrate european unity .
however , before implementation , the draft constitution still has some hurdles to clear .
the final draft wo n't be completed until after an intergovernmental conference with current eu members and the 10 accession states , which takes place in october .
during the conference , governments will have another opportunity to make revisions to the draft .
but on thursday , giscard d 'estaing pled for restraint .
" trying to change this consensus would run the risk of dislocating the whole thing , and historians might one day say that a great opportunity was missed , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .
the plan which was approved by german parliament will see one of two alternatives .
under one proposal , led by state secretary for culture christina weiss , the façade of the old hohenzollern palace will be reconstructed on three sides and the inside space entirely devoted for , as yet , unspecified cultural purposes .
that proposal calls for 80 percent funding by the german taxpayer , with the remaining 20 percent coming from private investors .
the second proposal is the brainchild of wilhelm von boddien , a hamburg businessman who has lobbied for more than a decade to re-build the building ’ s façade .
but his plan calls for the interior to be turned into two hotels and numerous plush offices .
unlike weiss ' , boddien has said 80 percent of the costs will be shouldered by private investors .
the remaining 20 percent will be publicly funded .
both projects will cost roughly € 600 million -lrb- $ 681 million . -rrb-

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .

the days are numbered for the old volkswagen beetle .
on thursday the perennially popular love bug will roll off mexican production lines for the last time , bringing an end to over 70 years of automobile history . it ’ s unlikely any other car could have held onto its popularity for so long , providing generations with affordable and reliable transportation for over half a century as well as inspiring millions to embrace its plucky sense of " fahrvergnügen " .
then again the volkswagen beetle is no ordinary car .
first conceived in the early 1930s out of hitler ’ s desire to create an affordable " people ’ s car " -lrb- that ’ s volkswagen in german -rrb- , the chubby beetle went into mass production after world war ii .
since then some 22 million bug-eyed cars have rolled off the assembly lines , making it the most-built car ever .
but starting thursday when volkswagen rolls out one last special limited edition at its production plant in puebla , mexico , the love bug - an icon of 1960s flower power - will go the way of so many other popular and cherished relics of the era and find itself relegated to collectors ’ garages and museums .
adios to the beetle when the vw plant in mexico – the only one in the world still making the old-style beetle – launches its last retro edition on thursday it will be a slight intermission before the curtain finally falls on nearly 70 years of automobile history .
according to the german company , the beetle line will almost certainly be put to rest by the end of the month .
" there has never been a car like it , but i don ’ t think production will go beyond " the end of july , christine kuhlmeyer , head of corporate communications at volkswagen in mexico , told reuters .
the car ’ s fate was actually sealed last month , when the carmaker cited falling annual sales as the reason for the company ’ s decision to stop production of the original beetle .
" the beetle has been a hugely successful car for decades , it made volkswagen famous , " company spokesman fred bärbock told deutsche welle .
" but now we ’ ve had to recognize that demand for the original beetle has fallen . "
at the height of its production , the company made between 30,000 and 40,000 of the dome-shaped cars each year .
last year only 24,000 cars rolled out of the factory , a drop of nearly 50 percent compared to 2000 sales .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagon employees walk out of an office in the city of puebla , mexico , july 9 , 2003 .
beetle city mexico the end of the original beetle will be especially hard felt in the mexican town of puebla , where the car has been manufactured since 1967 and for many has become like a member of the family .
although the plant will continue producing vw cars , it ’ s the beetle they are most fond of .
since the wolfsburg mother factory moved its beetle production south-east of mexico city , an entire generation of factory workers have placed their hands on the cherished car they call " vocho . "
and the car has become a veritable symbol of the town , appearing on all the street signs in the historic center .
even the cathedral was sponsored by volkswagen .
" it ’ s a jewel for me .
the little bug has given my family prosperity , " said armando pasillas , 60 , describing to reuters how much he ’ ll miss the car .
having worked at the plant for 37 years , pasillas said he likes seeing the cars on the street because he knows they have all passed through his hands .
more importantly , the company has had a significant influence on the town ’ s economics .
the vw factory employs 14,000 workers who produce both the new beetle , the new beetle cabriolet and the jetta in addition to the original beetle .
together with auto parts suppliers , distributors and dealerships more than 60,000 townspeople have found work associated with volkswagen .
despite shutting down production on the beetle , volkswagen has insisted that the puebla plant is still an important investment and manufacturing site .
" mexico remains , as it was before -lsb- stopping the original beetle -rsb- an important point of investment for us .
it is our only plant in the north american region , " bärbock said , adding that the company will move its entire production of the bora to puebla starting in 2005 .

with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .
do not respond by saying no . "
european official holiday the constitution aims to simplify the eu tangled law-making procedures , make institutions more transparent and install a full-time president of the european council and foreign minister , as well as allowing many more eu-wide policies to be approved with majority voting by the european council .
also entailed in the draft is an official motto of the eu , which will be " united in diversity , " an official eu song , which is to be beethoven 's " ode to joy " and an official holiday on may 9 to celebrate european unity .
however , before implementation , the draft constitution still has some hurdles to clear .
the final draft wo n't be completed until after an intergovernmental conference with current eu members and the 10 accession states , which takes place in october .
during the conference , governments will have another opportunity to make revisions to the draft .
but on thursday , giscard d 'estaing pled for restraint .
" trying to change this consensus would run the risk of dislocating the whole thing , and historians might one day say that a great opportunity was missed , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .

the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .
do not respond by saying no . "
european official holiday the constitution aims to simplify the eu tangled law-making procedures , make institutions more transparent and install a full-time president of the european council and foreign minister , as well as allowing many more eu-wide policies to be approved with majority voting by the european council .

the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .
the move is aimed at heading off a total ban on the controversial technology .
at the moment , a moratorium is in place , and since the beginning of the year , no eu money has been granted to scientists who create embryos to carry out the research .
european commission research spokesman fabio fabbi told reuters news agency " the research moratorium finishes at the end of 2003 and we want to have comprehensive guidelines in place . "
the proposals must now be approved by the council of ministers and the european parliament .
cure for disease vs. designer baby theories scientists say the research could produce cures for diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease , and that stem cells can be used to help restore the functions of damaged or failed organs .
opponents of the use of embryonic stem cells accuse scientists of " playing god " and say the new technology will inevitably be abused , resulting in human cloning and what they call " designer babies . "
the procedure is also controversial because the embryos are killed when the stem cells are harvested .
stem cells are considered the " master cells " in the human body .
embryonic cells can grow to form more than 200 different kinds of tissue .
one way of making them is what 's known as therapeutic cloning , effectively by creating embryos so that the stem cells can be used for therapeutic purposes .
adult stem cells are to be found in many organs , but their use for creating other kinds of tissue is limited .
however , their use for medical purposes is also far less controversial .
guidelines delayed by german resistance the new proposals were scheduled to be adopted last week , but those plans were thwarted by stiff resistance from some member states , notably germany .
last year , the german parliament passed a law banning the creation of human embryos or the use of human embryos created in germany for scientific purposes , but allowing the import of embryos in exceptional cases of " high-priority research goals . "
only embryos created before january 1 , 2002 , are allowed to be imported , and so far , licenses have been granted to just three scientists to do so .
the laws are similarly strict in france , spain , austria , ireland and denmark .
research into leftover embryos is legal in britain .
in germany , critics of the new guidelines argue that they are looser than domestic law , meaning german money paid into eu coffers could be used to fund research elsewhere in europe , while scientists who carried out the same research in germany would face criminal charges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn the german education and research minister , edelgard bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the social democrats , has come under fire for her role in the negotiations .

the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .
the move is aimed at heading off a total ban on the controversial technology .
at the moment , a moratorium is in place , and since the beginning of the year , no eu money has been granted to scientists who create embryos to carry out the research .
european commission research spokesman fabio fabbi told reuters news agency " the research moratorium finishes at the end of 2003 and we want to have comprehensive guidelines in place . "
the proposals must now be approved by the council of ministers and the european parliament .
cure for disease vs. designer baby theories scientists say the research could produce cures for diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease , and that stem cells can be used to help restore the functions of damaged or failed organs .
opponents of the use of embryonic stem cells accuse scientists of " playing god " and say the new technology will inevitably be abused , resulting in human cloning and what they call " designer babies . "
the procedure is also controversial because the embryos are killed when the stem cells are harvested .
stem cells are considered the " master cells " in the human body .
embryonic cells can grow to form more than 200 different kinds of tissue .
one way of making them is what 's known as therapeutic cloning , effectively by creating embryos so that the stem cells can be used for therapeutic purposes .
adult stem cells are to be found in many organs , but their use for creating other kinds of tissue is limited .
however , their use for medical purposes is also far less controversial .
guidelines delayed by german resistance the new proposals were scheduled to be adopted last week , but those plans were thwarted by stiff resistance from some member states , notably germany .
last year , the german parliament passed a law banning the creation of human embryos or the use of human embryos created in germany for scientific purposes , but allowing the import of embryos in exceptional cases of " high-priority research goals . "
only embryos created before january 1 , 2002 , are allowed to be imported , and so far , licenses have been granted to just three scientists to do so .
the laws are similarly strict in france , spain , austria , ireland and denmark .
research into leftover embryos is legal in britain .
in germany , critics of the new guidelines argue that they are looser than domestic law , meaning german money paid into eu coffers could be used to fund research elsewhere in europe , while scientists who carried out the same research in germany would face criminal charges .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .
the plan which was approved by german parliament will see one of two alternatives .
under one proposal , led by state secretary for culture christina weiss , the façade of the old hohenzollern palace will be reconstructed on three sides and the inside space entirely devoted for , as yet , unspecified cultural purposes .
that proposal calls for 80 percent funding by the german taxpayer , with the remaining 20 percent coming from private investors .
the second proposal is the brainchild of wilhelm von boddien , a hamburg businessman who has lobbied for more than a decade to re-build the building ’ s façade .
but his plan calls for the interior to be turned into two hotels and numerous plush offices .
unlike weiss ' , boddien has said 80 percent of the costs will be shouldered by private investors .
the remaining 20 percent will be publicly funded .
both projects will cost roughly € 600 million -lrb- $ 681 million . -rrb-

with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .

giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .
do not respond by saying no . "
european official holiday the constitution aims to simplify the eu tangled law-making procedures , make institutions more transparent and install a full-time president of the european council and foreign minister , as well as allowing many more eu-wide policies to be approved with majority voting by the european council .
also entailed in the draft is an official motto of the eu , which will be " united in diversity , " an official eu song , which is to be beethoven 's " ode to joy " and an official holiday on may 9 to celebrate european unity .
however , before implementation , the draft constitution still has some hurdles to clear .
the final draft wo n't be completed until after an intergovernmental conference with current eu members and the 10 accession states , which takes place in october .
during the conference , governments will have another opportunity to make revisions to the draft .
but on thursday , giscard d 'estaing pled for restraint .

the days are numbered for the old volkswagen beetle .
on thursday the perennially popular love bug will roll off mexican production lines for the last time , bringing an end to over 70 years of automobile history . it ’ s unlikely any other car could have held onto its popularity for so long , providing generations with affordable and reliable transportation for over half a century as well as inspiring millions to embrace its plucky sense of " fahrvergnügen " .
then again the volkswagen beetle is no ordinary car .
first conceived in the early 1930s out of hitler ’ s desire to create an affordable " people ’ s car " -lrb- that ’ s volkswagen in german -rrb- , the chubby beetle went into mass production after world war ii .
since then some 22 million bug-eyed cars have rolled off the assembly lines , making it the most-built car ever .
but starting thursday when volkswagen rolls out one last special limited edition at its production plant in puebla , mexico , the love bug - an icon of 1960s flower power - will go the way of so many other popular and cherished relics of the era and find itself relegated to collectors ’ garages and museums .
adios to the beetle when the vw plant in mexico – the only one in the world still making the old-style beetle – launches its last retro edition on thursday it will be a slight intermission before the curtain finally falls on nearly 70 years of automobile history .
according to the german company , the beetle line will almost certainly be put to rest by the end of the month .
" there has never been a car like it , but i don ’ t think production will go beyond " the end of july , christine kuhlmeyer , head of corporate communications at volkswagen in mexico , told reuters .
the car ’ s fate was actually sealed last month , when the carmaker cited falling annual sales as the reason for the company ’ s decision to stop production of the original beetle .
" the beetle has been a hugely successful car for decades , it made volkswagen famous , " company spokesman fred bärbock told deutsche welle .
" but now we ’ ve had to recognize that demand for the original beetle has fallen . "
at the height of its production , the company made between 30,000 and 40,000 of the dome-shaped cars each year .
last year only 24,000 cars rolled out of the factory , a drop of nearly 50 percent compared to 2000 sales .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .

the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .

the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .

with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .

the days are numbered for the old volkswagen beetle .
on thursday the perennially popular love bug will roll off mexican production lines for the last time , bringing an end to over 70 years of automobile history . it ’ s unlikely any other car could have held onto its popularity for so long , providing generations with affordable and reliable transportation for over half a century as well as inspiring millions to embrace its plucky sense of " fahrvergnügen " .
then again the volkswagen beetle is no ordinary car .
first conceived in the early 1930s out of hitler ’ s desire to create an affordable " people ’ s car " -lrb- that ’ s volkswagen in german -rrb- , the chubby beetle went into mass production after world war ii .
since then some 22 million bug-eyed cars have rolled off the assembly lines , making it the most-built car ever .
but starting thursday when volkswagen rolls out one last special limited edition at its production plant in puebla , mexico , the love bug - an icon of 1960s flower power - will go the way of so many other popular and cherished relics of the era and find itself relegated to collectors ’ garages and museums .
adios to the beetle when the vw plant in mexico – the only one in the world still making the old-style beetle – launches its last retro edition on thursday it will be a slight intermission before the curtain finally falls on nearly 70 years of automobile history .
according to the german company , the beetle line will almost certainly be put to rest by the end of the month .
" there has never been a car like it , but i don ’ t think production will go beyond " the end of july , christine kuhlmeyer , head of corporate communications at volkswagen in mexico , told reuters .
the car ’ s fate was actually sealed last month , when the carmaker cited falling annual sales as the reason for the company ’ s decision to stop production of the original beetle .
" the beetle has been a hugely successful car for decades , it made volkswagen famous , " company spokesman fred bärbock told deutsche welle .
" but now we ’ ve had to recognize that demand for the original beetle has fallen . "
at the height of its production , the company made between 30,000 and 40,000 of the dome-shaped cars each year .
last year only 24,000 cars rolled out of the factory , a drop of nearly 50 percent compared to 2000 sales .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagon employees walk out of an office in the city of puebla , mexico , july 9 , 2003 .
beetle city mexico the end of the original beetle will be especially hard felt in the mexican town of puebla , where the car has been manufactured since 1967 and for many has become like a member of the family .
although the plant will continue producing vw cars , it ’ s the beetle they are most fond of .
since the wolfsburg mother factory moved its beetle production south-east of mexico city , an entire generation of factory workers have placed their hands on the cherished car they call " vocho . "
and the car has become a veritable symbol of the town , appearing on all the street signs in the historic center .
even the cathedral was sponsored by volkswagen .
" it ’ s a jewel for me .
the little bug has given my family prosperity , " said armando pasillas , 60 , describing to reuters how much he ’ ll miss the car .
having worked at the plant for 37 years , pasillas said he likes seeing the cars on the street because he knows they have all passed through his hands .
more importantly , the company has had a significant influence on the town ’ s economics .
the vw factory employs 14,000 workers who produce both the new beetle , the new beetle cabriolet and the jetta in addition to the original beetle .
together with auto parts suppliers , distributors and dealerships more than 60,000 townspeople have found work associated with volkswagen .
despite shutting down production on the beetle , volkswagen has insisted that the puebla plant is still an important investment and manufacturing site .
" mexico remains , as it was before -lsb- stopping the original beetle -rsb- an important point of investment for us .
it is our only plant in the north american region , " bärbock said , adding that the company will move its entire production of the bora to puebla starting in 2005 .
although that ’ s good news for the puebla plant employees , it does little to console those who are mourning the end of the beetle . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .
the move is aimed at heading off a total ban on the controversial technology .
at the moment , a moratorium is in place , and since the beginning of the year , no eu money has been granted to scientists who create embryos to carry out the research .
european commission research spokesman fabio fabbi told reuters news agency " the research moratorium finishes at the end of 2003 and we want to have comprehensive guidelines in place . "
the proposals must now be approved by the council of ministers and the european parliament .
cure for disease vs. designer baby theories scientists say the research could produce cures for diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease , and that stem cells can be used to help restore the functions of damaged or failed organs .
opponents of the use of embryonic stem cells accuse scientists of " playing god " and say the new technology will inevitably be abused , resulting in human cloning and what they call " designer babies . "
the procedure is also controversial because the embryos are killed when the stem cells are harvested .
stem cells are considered the " master cells " in the human body .
embryonic cells can grow to form more than 200 different kinds of tissue .
one way of making them is what 's known as therapeutic cloning , effectively by creating embryos so that the stem cells can be used for therapeutic purposes .
adult stem cells are to be found in many organs , but their use for creating other kinds of tissue is limited .
however , their use for medical purposes is also far less controversial .
guidelines delayed by german resistance the new proposals were scheduled to be adopted last week , but those plans were thwarted by stiff resistance from some member states , notably germany .
last year , the german parliament passed a law banning the creation of human embryos or the use of human embryos created in germany for scientific purposes , but allowing the import of embryos in exceptional cases of " high-priority research goals . "
only embryos created before january 1 , 2002 , are allowed to be imported , and so far , licenses have been granted to just three scientists to do so .
the laws are similarly strict in france , spain , austria , ireland and denmark .
research into leftover embryos is legal in britain .
in germany , critics of the new guidelines argue that they are looser than domestic law , meaning german money paid into eu coffers could be used to fund research elsewhere in europe , while scientists who carried out the same research in germany would face criminal charges .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .

the days are numbered for the old volkswagen beetle .
on thursday the perennially popular love bug will roll off mexican production lines for the last time , bringing an end to over 70 years of automobile history . it ’ s unlikely any other car could have held onto its popularity for so long , providing generations with affordable and reliable transportation for over half a century as well as inspiring millions to embrace its plucky sense of " fahrvergnügen " .

first conceived in the early 1930s out of hitler ’ s desire to create an affordable " people ’ s car " -lrb- that ’ s volkswagen in german -rrb- , the chubby beetle went into mass production after world war ii .
since then some 22 million bug-eyed cars have rolled off the assembly lines , making it the most-built car ever .
but starting thursday when volkswagen rolls out one last special limited edition at its production plant in puebla , mexico , the love bug - an icon of 1960s flower power - will go the way of so many other popular and cherished relics of the era and find itself relegated to collectors ’ garages and museums .
adios to the beetle when the vw plant in mexico – the only one in the world still making the old-style beetle – launches its last retro edition on thursday it will be a slight intermission before the curtain finally falls on nearly 70 years of automobile history .
according to the german company , the beetle line will almost certainly be put to rest by the end of the month .
" there has never been a car like it , but i don ’ t think production will go beyond " the end of july , christine kuhlmeyer , head of corporate communications at volkswagen in mexico , told reuters .
the car ’ s fate was actually sealed last month , when the carmaker cited falling annual sales as the reason for the company ’ s decision to stop production of the original beetle .
" the beetle has been a hugely successful car for decades , it made volkswagen famous , " company spokesman fred bärbock told deutsche welle .
" but now we ’ ve had to recognize that demand for the original beetle has fallen . "
at the height of its production , the company made between 30,000 and 40,000 of the dome-shaped cars each year .
last year only 24,000 cars rolled out of the factory , a drop of nearly 50 percent compared to 2000 sales .

the vw factory employs 14,000 workers who produce both the new beetle , the new beetle cabriolet and the jetta in addition to the original beetle .
together with auto parts suppliers , distributors and dealerships more than 60,000 townspeople have found work associated with volkswagen .
despite shutting down production on the beetle , volkswagen has insisted that the puebla plant is still an important investment and manufacturing site .
" mexico remains , as it was before -lsb- stopping the original beetle -rsb- an important point of investment for us .
it is our only plant in the north american region , " bärbock said , adding that the company will move its entire production of the bora to puebla starting in 2005 .
although that ’ s good news for the puebla plant employees , it does little to console those who are mourning the end of the beetle . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .

with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.07.2003 eu sets rules for embryo research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research remains a highly disputed topic .
the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .
the move is aimed at heading off a total ban on the controversial technology .
at the moment , a moratorium is in place , and since the beginning of the year , no eu money has been granted to scientists who create embryos to carry out the research .
european commission research spokesman fabio fabbi told reuters news agency " the research moratorium finishes at the end of 2003 and we want to have comprehensive guidelines in place . "
the proposals must now be approved by the council of ministers and the european parliament .
cure for disease vs. designer baby theories scientists say the research could produce cures for diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease , and that stem cells can be used to help restore the functions of damaged or failed organs .
opponents of the use of embryonic stem cells accuse scientists of " playing god " and say the new technology will inevitably be abused , resulting in human cloning and what they call " designer babies . "
the procedure is also controversial because the embryos are killed when the stem cells are harvested .
stem cells are considered the " master cells " in the human body .
embryonic cells can grow to form more than 200 different kinds of tissue .
one way of making them is what 's known as therapeutic cloning , effectively by creating embryos so that the stem cells can be used for therapeutic purposes .
adult stem cells are to be found in many organs , but their use for creating other kinds of tissue is limited .
however , their use for medical purposes is also far less controversial .
guidelines delayed by german resistance the new proposals were scheduled to be adopted last week , but those plans were thwarted by stiff resistance from some member states , notably germany .
last year , the german parliament passed a law banning the creation of human embryos or the use of human embryos created in germany for scientific purposes , but allowing the import of embryos in exceptional cases of " high-priority research goals . "
only embryos created before january 1 , 2002 , are allowed to be imported , and so far , licenses have been granted to just three scientists to do so .
the laws are similarly strict in france , spain , austria , ireland and denmark .
research into leftover embryos is legal in britain .
in germany , critics of the new guidelines argue that they are looser than domestic law , meaning german money paid into eu coffers could be used to fund research elsewhere in europe , while scientists who carried out the same research in germany would face criminal charges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn the german education and research minister , edelgard bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the social democrats , has come under fire for her role in the negotiations .
hiltrud breyer , a member of the european parliament and the green party , said the minister was not outspoken enough .
her fellow mep , peter liese , a christian democrat , said bulmahn did n't get involved in the process of drafting the guidelines early enough . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

with agreements to maintain veto rights on issues dealing with immigration , labor markets , cultural trade and foreign policy , the european convention completed its historic work of drafting a constitution on thursday . after 18 months of work at the helm of the european convention , valéry giscard d 'estaing became the first delegate to sign the completed draft of the european union 's first-ever constitution on thursday .
the 105 members of the convention , representing 25 countries , have been working on the text with convention president d 'estaing and two vice-presidents for more than 16 months .
on thursday , the president thanked his delegates and wrapped up his work .
" i am proud to have been your president during this time and to have steered this ship " , he told the delegates .
despite storms , frosty disputes and high waves en route , the convention had made it safely to port by producing and agreeing on a draft constitution .
in brussels , there was a feeling of happiness and relief among delegates .
" we can all be proud and thankful that we have been a part of this , " said the german convention and european parliament member klaus haensch .
various veto rights remain almost without exception , the delegates were open about the fact that they had fought for changes up to the very last minute .
however , most of the delegates proved pleased with the number of concessions that were built in to the end draft .
" we wished for more , without any doubt , from a national standpoint , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer , who led his country 's delegation .
" but we were n't writing a national constitution , rather a european constitution .
and in that respect this is an impressive achievement . "
however , there were some issues over which countries failed to find unity .
in the areas of foreign and tax policy , the veto right of member states will remain in place despite pressure from germany to place those policy areas under the control of eu qualified majority voting .
eliminating the veto would have been politically impossible for britain .
germany succeeded in eliminating passages that would have placed control of immigration and labor market policies in the hands of brussels .
and the french won the right to maintain its veto over trade decisions involving cultural products – like hollywood films – that it maintains could threaten europe 's " linguistic and cultural diversity . "
" maximum achievement " " the constitution offers the people of our european union the best view yet of who , and with what democratic legitimacy , makes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , " said haensch .
giscard d 'estaing said thursday he considered the draft constitution a great success – a unified and balanced work – but that more unity would have been impossible .
" the consensus reached ... far from being the lowest common denominator , " represents the maximum that could be achieved , " giscard d 'estaing said .
he then appealed to politicians in europe to push for the ratification of the treaty .
" citizens , say ' yes ' to our constitution .
do not respond by saying no . "
european official holiday the constitution aims to simplify the eu tangled law-making procedures , make institutions more transparent and install a full-time president of the european council and foreign minister , as well as allowing many more eu-wide policies to be approved with majority voting by the european council .
also entailed in the draft is an official motto of the eu , which will be " united in diversity , " an official eu song , which is to be beethoven 's " ode to joy " and an official holiday on may 9 to celebrate european unity .
however , before implementation , the draft constitution still has some hurdles to clear .
the final draft wo n't be completed until after an intergovernmental conference with current eu members and the 10 accession states , which takes place in october .
during the conference , governments will have another opportunity to make revisions to the draft .
but on thursday , giscard d 'estaing pled for restraint .
" trying to change this consensus would run the risk of dislocating the whole thing , and historians might one day say that a great opportunity was missed , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany wins a key concession on immigration but fails to have veto powers abolished for foreign , defense and taxation policies .

the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .
the move is aimed at heading off a total ban on the controversial technology .
at the moment , a moratorium is in place , and since the beginning of the year , no eu money has been granted to scientists who create embryos to carry out the research .
european commission research spokesman fabio fabbi told reuters news agency " the research moratorium finishes at the end of 2003 and we want to have comprehensive guidelines in place . "
the proposals must now be approved by the council of ministers and the european parliament .
cure for disease vs. designer baby theories scientists say the research could produce cures for diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease , and that stem cells can be used to help restore the functions of damaged or failed organs .
opponents of the use of embryonic stem cells accuse scientists of " playing god " and say the new technology will inevitably be abused , resulting in human cloning and what they call " designer babies . "
the procedure is also controversial because the embryos are killed when the stem cells are harvested .
stem cells are considered the " master cells " in the human body .
embryonic cells can grow to form more than 200 different kinds of tissue .
one way of making them is what 's known as therapeutic cloning , effectively by creating embryos so that the stem cells can be used for therapeutic purposes .
adult stem cells are to be found in many organs , but their use for creating other kinds of tissue is limited .
however , their use for medical purposes is also far less controversial .
guidelines delayed by german resistance the new proposals were scheduled to be adopted last week , but those plans were thwarted by stiff resistance from some member states , notably germany .
last year , the german parliament passed a law banning the creation of human embryos or the use of human embryos created in germany for scientific purposes , but allowing the import of embryos in exceptional cases of " high-priority research goals . "
only embryos created before january 1 , 2002 , are allowed to be imported , and so far , licenses have been granted to just three scientists to do so .
the laws are similarly strict in france , spain , austria , ireland and denmark .
research into leftover embryos is legal in britain .
in germany , critics of the new guidelines argue that they are looser than domestic law , meaning german money paid into eu coffers could be used to fund research elsewhere in europe , while scientists who carried out the same research in germany would face criminal charges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn the german education and research minister , edelgard bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the social democrats , has come under fire for her role in the negotiations .
hiltrud breyer , a member of the european parliament and the green party , said the minister was not outspoken enough .
her fellow mep , peter liese , a christian democrat , said bulmahn did n't get involved in the process of drafting the guidelines early enough . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .
the plan which was approved by german parliament will see one of two alternatives .
under one proposal , led by state secretary for culture christina weiss , the façade of the old hohenzollern palace will be reconstructed on three sides and the inside space entirely devoted for , as yet , unspecified cultural purposes .
that proposal calls for 80 percent funding by the german taxpayer , with the remaining 20 percent coming from private investors .
the second proposal is the brainchild of wilhelm von boddien , a hamburg businessman who has lobbied for more than a decade to re-build the building ’ s façade .
but his plan calls for the interior to be turned into two hotels and numerous plush offices .
unlike weiss ' , boddien has said 80 percent of the costs will be shouldered by private investors .
the remaining 20 percent will be publicly funded .
both projects will cost roughly € 600 million -lrb- $ 681 million . -rrb-
fighting to save erich 's lamp shop but opposition groups , who have been fighting for years to save the palace , are furious at what they see as a political decision by the government to sweep east german history under the carpet .
" it 's a huge waste of taxpayers money , " lieselotte schulz , chairman of the association for the preservation of the palace of the republic told deutsche welle .
the association , officially formed in 1997 , has since gathered thousands of signatures from german citizens who want to save " eric 's lamp shop " -lrb- called so because of the thousands of light fittings it had -rrb- .
many of the association 's supporters have fond memories of personal achievements , such as school graduations , which they celebrated in the palace of the republic .
" it 's the only building of it 's type in the world , " schulz says .
no decision reached no final decision has been reached , according to the federal ministry for transport , buildings and living which looks after the building owned by the german state .
but even it admits that the re-building plans currently in the pipeline mean the fate of the palace is likely to have already been sealed .
" obviously it -lrb- the palace -rrb- will have to be torn down if a reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace takes place , since the new building will stand on the same spot , " horst grothues , the government official in charge of the project , told deutsche welle . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de re-building berlin 's royal palace berlin was largely destroyed during world war ii .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .
the minister said companies needed to consider part-time work even in the afternoons that would n't necessarily amount to half-day work .

the days are numbered for the old volkswagen beetle .
on thursday the perennially popular love bug will roll off mexican production lines for the last time , bringing an end to over 70 years of automobile history . it ’ s unlikely any other car could have held onto its popularity for so long , providing generations with affordable and reliable transportation for over half a century as well as inspiring millions to embrace its plucky sense of " fahrvergnügen " .
then again the volkswagen beetle is no ordinary car .
first conceived in the early 1930s out of hitler ’ s desire to create an affordable " people ’ s car " -lrb- that ’ s volkswagen in german -rrb- , the chubby beetle went into mass production after world war ii .
since then some 22 million bug-eyed cars have rolled off the assembly lines , making it the most-built car ever .
but starting thursday when volkswagen rolls out one last special limited edition at its production plant in puebla , mexico , the love bug - an icon of 1960s flower power - will go the way of so many other popular and cherished relics of the era and find itself relegated to collectors ’ garages and museums .
adios to the beetle when the vw plant in mexico – the only one in the world still making the old-style beetle – launches its last retro edition on thursday it will be a slight intermission before the curtain finally falls on nearly 70 years of automobile history .
according to the german company , the beetle line will almost certainly be put to rest by the end of the month .
" there has never been a car like it , but i don ’ t think production will go beyond " the end of july , christine kuhlmeyer , head of corporate communications at volkswagen in mexico , told reuters .
the car ’ s fate was actually sealed last month , when the carmaker cited falling annual sales as the reason for the company ’ s decision to stop production of the original beetle .
" the beetle has been a hugely successful car for decades , it made volkswagen famous , " company spokesman fred bärbock told deutsche welle .
" but now we ’ ve had to recognize that demand for the original beetle has fallen . "
at the height of its production , the company made between 30,000 and 40,000 of the dome-shaped cars each year .
last year only 24,000 cars rolled out of the factory , a drop of nearly 50 percent compared to 2000 sales .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagon employees walk out of an office in the city of puebla , mexico , july 9 , 2003 .
beetle city mexico the end of the original beetle will be especially hard felt in the mexican town of puebla , where the car has been manufactured since 1967 and for many has become like a member of the family .
although the plant will continue producing vw cars , it ’ s the beetle they are most fond of .
since the wolfsburg mother factory moved its beetle production south-east of mexico city , an entire generation of factory workers have placed their hands on the cherished car they call " vocho . "
and the car has become a veritable symbol of the town , appearing on all the street signs in the historic center .
even the cathedral was sponsored by volkswagen .
" it ’ s a jewel for me .
the little bug has given my family prosperity , " said armando pasillas , 60 , describing to reuters how much he ’ ll miss the car .
having worked at the plant for 37 years , pasillas said he likes seeing the cars on the street because he knows they have all passed through his hands .
more importantly , the company has had a significant influence on the town ’ s economics .
the vw factory employs 14,000 workers who produce both the new beetle , the new beetle cabriolet and the jetta in addition to the original beetle .
together with auto parts suppliers , distributors and dealerships more than 60,000 townspeople have found work associated with volkswagen .
despite shutting down production on the beetle , volkswagen has insisted that the puebla plant is still an important investment and manufacturing site .
" mexico remains , as it was before -lsb- stopping the original beetle -rsb- an important point of investment for us .
it is our only plant in the north american region , " bärbock said , adding that the company will move its entire production of the bora to puebla starting in 2005 .
although that ’ s good news for the puebla plant employees , it does little to console those who are mourning the end of the beetle . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.07.2003 eu sets rules for embryo research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research remains a highly disputed topic .
the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .
the move is aimed at heading off a total ban on the controversial technology .
at the moment , a moratorium is in place , and since the beginning of the year , no eu money has been granted to scientists who create embryos to carry out the research .
european commission research spokesman fabio fabbi told reuters news agency " the research moratorium finishes at the end of 2003 and we want to have comprehensive guidelines in place . "
the proposals must now be approved by the council of ministers and the european parliament .
cure for disease vs. designer baby theories scientists say the research could produce cures for diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease , and that stem cells can be used to help restore the functions of damaged or failed organs .
opponents of the use of embryonic stem cells accuse scientists of " playing god " and say the new technology will inevitably be abused , resulting in human cloning and what they call " designer babies . "
the procedure is also controversial because the embryos are killed when the stem cells are harvested .
stem cells are considered the " master cells " in the human body .
embryonic cells can grow to form more than 200 different kinds of tissue .
one way of making them is what 's known as therapeutic cloning , effectively by creating embryos so that the stem cells can be used for therapeutic purposes .
adult stem cells are to be found in many organs , but their use for creating other kinds of tissue is limited .
however , their use for medical purposes is also far less controversial .
guidelines delayed by german resistance the new proposals were scheduled to be adopted last week , but those plans were thwarted by stiff resistance from some member states , notably germany .
last year , the german parliament passed a law banning the creation of human embryos or the use of human embryos created in germany for scientific purposes , but allowing the import of embryos in exceptional cases of " high-priority research goals . "
only embryos created before january 1 , 2002 , are allowed to be imported , and so far , licenses have been granted to just three scientists to do so .
the laws are similarly strict in france , spain , austria , ireland and denmark .
research into leftover embryos is legal in britain .
in germany , critics of the new guidelines argue that they are looser than domestic law , meaning german money paid into eu coffers could be used to fund research elsewhere in europe , while scientists who carried out the same research in germany would face criminal charges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn the german education and research minister , edelgard bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the social democrats , has come under fire for her role in the negotiations .
hiltrud breyer , a member of the european parliament and the green party , said the minister was not outspoken enough .
her fellow mep , peter liese , a christian democrat , said bulmahn did n't get involved in the process of drafting the guidelines early enough . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .
the plan which was approved by german parliament will see one of two alternatives .
under one proposal , led by state secretary for culture christina weiss , the façade of the old hohenzollern palace will be reconstructed on three sides and the inside space entirely devoted for , as yet , unspecified cultural purposes .
that proposal calls for 80 percent funding by the german taxpayer , with the remaining 20 percent coming from private investors .
the second proposal is the brainchild of wilhelm von boddien , a hamburg businessman who has lobbied for more than a decade to re-build the building ’ s façade .
but his plan calls for the interior to be turned into two hotels and numerous plush offices .
unlike weiss ' , boddien has said 80 percent of the costs will be shouldered by private investors .
the remaining 20 percent will be publicly funded .
both projects will cost roughly € 600 million -lrb- $ 681 million . -rrb-

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .
the plan which was approved by german parliament will see one of two alternatives .
under one proposal , led by state secretary for culture christina weiss , the façade of the old hohenzollern palace will be reconstructed on three sides and the inside space entirely devoted for , as yet , unspecified cultural purposes .
that proposal calls for 80 percent funding by the german taxpayer , with the remaining 20 percent coming from private investors .
the second proposal is the brainchild of wilhelm von boddien , a hamburg businessman who has lobbied for more than a decade to re-build the building ’ s façade .
but his plan calls for the interior to be turned into two hotels and numerous plush offices .
unlike weiss ' , boddien has said 80 percent of the costs will be shouldered by private investors .
the remaining 20 percent will be publicly funded .
both projects will cost roughly € 600 million -lrb- $ 681 million . -rrb-
fighting to save erich 's lamp shop but opposition groups , who have been fighting for years to save the palace , are furious at what they see as a political decision by the government to sweep east german history under the carpet .
" it 's a huge waste of taxpayers money , " lieselotte schulz , chairman of the association for the preservation of the palace of the republic told deutsche welle .
the association , officially formed in 1997 , has since gathered thousands of signatures from german citizens who want to save " eric 's lamp shop " -lrb- called so because of the thousands of light fittings it had -rrb- .
many of the association 's supporters have fond memories of personal achievements , such as school graduations , which they celebrated in the palace of the republic .
" it 's the only building of it 's type in the world , " schulz says .
no decision reached no final decision has been reached , according to the federal ministry for transport , buildings and living which looks after the building owned by the german state .
but even it admits that the re-building plans currently in the pipeline mean the fate of the palace is likely to have already been sealed .
" obviously it -lrb- the palace -rrb- will have to be torn down if a reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace takes place , since the new building will stand on the same spot , " horst grothues , the government official in charge of the project , told deutsche welle . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de re-building berlin 's royal palace berlin was largely destroyed during world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.07.2003 eu sets rules for embryo research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem cell research remains a highly disputed topic .
the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .
the move is aimed at heading off a total ban on the controversial technology .
at the moment , a moratorium is in place , and since the beginning of the year , no eu money has been granted to scientists who create embryos to carry out the research .
european commission research spokesman fabio fabbi told reuters news agency " the research moratorium finishes at the end of 2003 and we want to have comprehensive guidelines in place . "
the proposals must now be approved by the council of ministers and the european parliament .
cure for disease vs. designer baby theories scientists say the research could produce cures for diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease , and that stem cells can be used to help restore the functions of damaged or failed organs .
opponents of the use of embryonic stem cells accuse scientists of " playing god " and say the new technology will inevitably be abused , resulting in human cloning and what they call " designer babies . "
the procedure is also controversial because the embryos are killed when the stem cells are harvested .
stem cells are considered the " master cells " in the human body .
embryonic cells can grow to form more than 200 different kinds of tissue .
one way of making them is what 's known as therapeutic cloning , effectively by creating embryos so that the stem cells can be used for therapeutic purposes .
adult stem cells are to be found in many organs , but their use for creating other kinds of tissue is limited .
however , their use for medical purposes is also far less controversial .
guidelines delayed by german resistance the new proposals were scheduled to be adopted last week , but those plans were thwarted by stiff resistance from some member states , notably germany .
last year , the german parliament passed a law banning the creation of human embryos or the use of human embryos created in germany for scientific purposes , but allowing the import of embryos in exceptional cases of " high-priority research goals . "
only embryos created before january 1 , 2002 , are allowed to be imported , and so far , licenses have been granted to just three scientists to do so .
the laws are similarly strict in france , spain , austria , ireland and denmark .
research into leftover embryos is legal in britain .
in germany , critics of the new guidelines argue that they are looser than domestic law , meaning german money paid into eu coffers could be used to fund research elsewhere in europe , while scientists who carried out the same research in germany would face criminal charges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn the german education and research minister , edelgard bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the social democrats , has come under fire for her role in the negotiations .
hiltrud breyer , a member of the european parliament and the green party , said the minister was not outspoken enough .
her fellow mep , peter liese , a christian democrat , said bulmahn did n't get involved in the process of drafting the guidelines early enough . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the days are numbered for the old volkswagen beetle .

first conceived in the early 1930s out of hitler ’ s desire to create an affordable " people ’ s car " -lrb- that ’ s volkswagen in german -rrb- , the chubby beetle went into mass production after world war ii .
since then some 22 million bug-eyed cars have rolled off the assembly lines , making it the most-built car ever .
but starting thursday when volkswagen rolls out one last special limited edition at its production plant in puebla , mexico , the love bug - an icon of 1960s flower power - will go the way of so many other popular and cherished relics of the era and find itself relegated to collectors ’ garages and museums .
adios to the beetle when the vw plant in mexico – the only one in the world still making the old-style beetle – launches its last retro edition on thursday it will be a slight intermission before the curtain finally falls on nearly 70 years of automobile history .
according to the german company , the beetle line will almost certainly be put to rest by the end of the month .
" there has never been a car like it , but i don ’ t think production will go beyond " the end of july , christine kuhlmeyer , head of corporate communications at volkswagen in mexico , told reuters .
the car ’ s fate was actually sealed last month , when the carmaker cited falling annual sales as the reason for the company ’ s decision to stop production of the original beetle .
" the beetle has been a hugely successful car for decades , it made volkswagen famous , " company spokesman fred bärbock told deutsche welle .
" but now we ’ ve had to recognize that demand for the original beetle has fallen . "
at the height of its production , the company made between 30,000 and 40,000 of the dome-shaped cars each year .
last year only 24,000 cars rolled out of the factory , a drop of nearly 50 percent compared to 2000 sales .

the european commissioner for research , philippe busquin , has presented new guidelines for regulating eu funding of embryonic stem cell research despite strong resistance from germany . european commissioner for research busquin said in brussels on wednesday the main thrust of the guidelines was to prevent the creation of embryos for research rather than using existing ones .
most of the embryos used in research are leftovers from fertility treatment , when extra embryos are created to increase the chances of pregnancy .
unused embryos are either destroyed or frozen for later use in research .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : philippe busquin , european research commissioner the commissioner -lrb- photo -rrb- said embryos could only be used with the parents ' consent .
he said the guidelines prohibited the use of embryos created after june 27 , 2002 , the day on which the latest eu research framework was adopted .
the program , which runs until 2006 , has earmarked more than € 2 billion for biotechnology research .
funding would only go to scientists in countries where national laws do not prohibit the procedures .
the move is aimed at heading off a total ban on the controversial technology .
at the moment , a moratorium is in place , and since the beginning of the year , no eu money has been granted to scientists who create embryos to carry out the research .
european commission research spokesman fabio fabbi told reuters news agency " the research moratorium finishes at the end of 2003 and we want to have comprehensive guidelines in place . "
the proposals must now be approved by the council of ministers and the european parliament .
cure for disease vs. designer baby theories scientists say the research could produce cures for diabetes , alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease , and that stem cells can be used to help restore the functions of damaged or failed organs .
opponents of the use of embryonic stem cells accuse scientists of " playing god " and say the new technology will inevitably be abused , resulting in human cloning and what they call " designer babies . "
the procedure is also controversial because the embryos are killed when the stem cells are harvested .
stem cells are considered the " master cells " in the human body .
embryonic cells can grow to form more than 200 different kinds of tissue .
one way of making them is what 's known as therapeutic cloning , effectively by creating embryos so that the stem cells can be used for therapeutic purposes .
adult stem cells are to be found in many organs , but their use for creating other kinds of tissue is limited .
however , their use for medical purposes is also far less controversial .
guidelines delayed by german resistance the new proposals were scheduled to be adopted last week , but those plans were thwarted by stiff resistance from some member states , notably germany .
last year , the german parliament passed a law banning the creation of human embryos or the use of human embryos created in germany for scientific purposes , but allowing the import of embryos in exceptional cases of " high-priority research goals . "
only embryos created before january 1 , 2002 , are allowed to be imported , and so far , licenses have been granted to just three scientists to do so .
the laws are similarly strict in france , spain , austria , ireland and denmark .
research into leftover embryos is legal in britain .
in germany , critics of the new guidelines argue that they are looser than domestic law , meaning german money paid into eu coffers could be used to fund research elsewhere in europe , while scientists who carried out the same research in germany would face criminal charges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education minister edelgard bulmahn the german education and research minister , edelgard bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- , of the social democrats , has come under fire for her role in the negotiations .
hiltrud breyer , a member of the european parliament and the green party , said the minister was not outspoken enough .
her fellow mep , peter liese , a christian democrat , said bulmahn did n't get involved in the process of drafting the guidelines early enough . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .
the plan which was approved by german parliament will see one of two alternatives .
under one proposal , led by state secretary for culture christina weiss , the façade of the old hohenzollern palace will be reconstructed on three sides and the inside space entirely devoted for , as yet , unspecified cultural purposes .
that proposal calls for 80 percent funding by the german taxpayer , with the remaining 20 percent coming from private investors .
the second proposal is the brainchild of wilhelm von boddien , a hamburg businessman who has lobbied for more than a decade to re-build the building ’ s façade .
but his plan calls for the interior to be turned into two hotels and numerous plush offices .
unlike weiss ' , boddien has said 80 percent of the costs will be shouldered by private investors .
the remaining 20 percent will be publicly funded .
both projects will cost roughly € 600 million -lrb- $ 681 million . -rrb-
fighting to save erich 's lamp shop but opposition groups , who have been fighting for years to save the palace , are furious at what they see as a political decision by the government to sweep east german history under the carpet .
" it 's a huge waste of taxpayers money , " lieselotte schulz , chairman of the association for the preservation of the palace of the republic told deutsche welle .
the association , officially formed in 1997 , has since gathered thousands of signatures from german citizens who want to save " eric 's lamp shop " -lrb- called so because of the thousands of light fittings it had -rrb- .
many of the association 's supporters have fond memories of personal achievements , such as school graduations , which they celebrated in the palace of the republic .
" it 's the only building of it 's type in the world , " schulz says .
no decision reached no final decision has been reached , according to the federal ministry for transport , buildings and living which looks after the building owned by the german state .
but even it admits that the re-building plans currently in the pipeline mean the fate of the palace is likely to have already been sealed .
" obviously it -lrb- the palace -rrb- will have to be torn down if a reconstruction of the hohenzollern palace takes place , since the new building will stand on the same spot , " horst grothues , the government official in charge of the project , told deutsche welle . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de re-building berlin 's royal palace berlin was largely destroyed during world war ii .

politics and industry have joined hands in germany to make companies more family and women friendly as the familiar problems of an ageing work force and falling birth rate are revisited on world population day on friday . it 's no secret that germany , the world 's third largest economy , is facing a ticking demographic time bomb .
with a rapidly graying population -lrb- by 2050 every third german is estimated to be 60 or older -rrb- and one of the lowest birth rates in western europe -lrb- just under 1.4 -rrb- , the country is in dire need of a serious trend reversal . a new two-year initiative by german minister for women and family affairs renate schmidt and the bertelsmann foundation unveiled this week hopes to do just that .
called " alliance for the family , " the aim is to promote a more family and women friendly corporate culture and impress upon companies that having flexible working hours and office day cares for employees with children works out to their advantage . " a better balance between family and career is important for all : for families because they need time for another , but also for companies because they will soon have massive problems in their search for skilled workers and in their number of customers if the low birth and employment rate among women remains constant , " schmidt said .
" germany ranks 181 among 190 countries when it comes to the birth rate and has the lowest women 's employment rate in the european union . " compared to other industrialized countries , germany does indeed have a considerably low number of working mothers .
only 10 percent of managers in germany are women with children ; in the u.s. the number is closer to 40 percent . firms weigh costs of being family-friendly liz mohn , head of the powerful bertelsmann media dynasty and a member of the board of trustees of the eponymously named foundation also emphasized the importance of juggling kids and career .
" it 's not just an important building block to counter the demographic trend , but family-friendly working conditions is also a crucial advantage in global competition . " the new initiative follows the release of a study earlier this week by the hertie foundation , which found that 90 percent of companies surveyed feared the costs involved in being more family-friendly . the establishment of a office day care is estimated to cost a firm up to € 25,000 and a further € 650 in monthly running costs .
just 70 companies out of a total three million nationwide were singled out for doing enough to warrant a " career and family " certificate handed out by the foundation to companies with exemplary family-friendly policies . state needs to do more for child care infrastructure chancellor schröder 's social democrat and green government has long made women-friendly policies a central plank of its agenda . government benefits range from offering tax breaks , a monthly per child bonus pay of € 154 , full-paid maternity leave for 14 weeks and child benefits of up to € 307 per child per month for the first two years -lrb- dependant on income -rrb- .
however a common complaint has been that the government benefits are n't complemented by providing enough day care centers and full-day schools that would encourage mothers to go back to work . a study by the bertelsmann foundation found that the german government guaranteed financial help for children , but did too little in providing childcare infrastructure .
thus the government spent a quarter of its budget earmarked for family and children in childcare early this year as opposed to industrialized nations such as denmark , which poured more than half its budget into day care , kindergartens and schools . a spokeswoman from the german ministry for families , seniors , women and youth , however , told deutsche welle that priorities were changing .
the government has now set aside € 4 billion that it will hand out over the next four years to the federal states to build up full-day schools and a further € 1.5 billion starting 2005 for providing child care for children under the age of three , she said . companies should pitch in too but in addition to the government 's role in helping women , renate schmidt now wants companies to play their part .
the " alliance for family " foresees bringing together local business , charity and family organizations together in round table conferences and searching for ways to harmonize family and career . schmidt says the companies should have more flexible working hours , services that are close to families and when possible establish office day care and enable employees with children to work from home .
the minister said special focus should be placed on part-time work and urged a " change in attitude " among personnel departments . " we need a higher part-time work quota in skilled jobs too , " she demanded .

berlin 's palace of the republic has been opened for the last time before its likely demolition .
but the fight to save one of the last symbols of the former east german regime continues . thousands of germans have been lining up in berlin over the past two weeks for a final look at the last bastion of the former east german regime .
der palast der republik -lrb- the palace of the republic . -rrb- has been opened to the public for the first time in 13 years .
guided tours have been taking place at the former seat of the east german parliament , offering germans the last chance to have a peek at their once-divided history before the building is likely torn down .
former seat of gdr government built in 1976 , the palace of the republic was constructed on the exact spot where gdr head eric honecker -lrb- 1912-1994 -rrb- ordered the demolition of the home of the former german royal family , the hohenzollern palace , 26 years earlier .
the ' people 's palace ' is a rather unsightly cuboid structure with orange-tinted windows on berlin 's central unter den linden boulevard .
under the communist regime , it housed governmental offices , was the meeting place for east germany 's trade unions and hosted cultural events for gdr citizens in its many bars and cafes .
it even had its own bowling alley .
asbestos riddle after re-unification , the fate of the old palace rose to the forefront of discussions on berlin ’ s city planning .
in the face of city plans to create a high-profile architectural area near the tourist magnet of the museum island , the gdr remnant was out of place .
but before a ruling was made on whether or not the communist eye-sore should be torn down , asbestos was discovered in the building .
the german government then shelled out € 70 million -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- to have it removed .
the presence of the synthetic fiber was just one factor bolstering the argument that big changes needed to be made .
and after over a decade of debate , the german government voted last july to tear it down and replace it with a reconstruction of the 19th-century baroque hohenzollern palace .
the resurrection of the royal home wo n't be a complete replica , however .
the plan which was approved by german parliament will see one of two alternatives .

a swiss court decides democracy is not always best , and hungary hears a call for a return to knitted shopping bags .
german holiday germany 's press is not convinced of the wisdom of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's decision to cancel his holiday in italy .
the frankfurter rundschau says the chancellor should n't have allowed his holiday plans to be wrecked by , as the paper puts it , " political hooligans in rome " .
a holiday in italy would have been in the national interest der tagesspiegel the paper concedes that gerhard schroeder 's anger is justified after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi failed to call a junior minister , stefano stefani , to account over what it calls " sweeping insults against the germans " .
but it points out that any boycott of italy would only hit the italian tourism industry rather than the government .
" precisely because the right-wing government in rome has attacked all germans indiscriminately , it would have been a sign of moral superiority not to make all italians pay for it , " the paper argues .
der tagesspiegel fears that the chancellor 's cancellation means he wo n't get a proper rest .
" a holiday in italy would have been in the national interest , " the paper declares .
the players in the row are using outmoded systems of old nationalistic reflexes der standard on a more serious note , it interprets gerhard schroeder 's decision as part of what it calls " his kind of populist foreign-domestic policies " .
" it has little to do with a foreign or european policy which is guided by reason , " the paper warns .
the sueddeutsche zeitung sees common ground between stefano stefani and the german chancellor .
" stefani , the popular press and now schroeder , too , are fuelling the vague feeling that one country can ' insult ' another , " the paper says .
it suggests that this kind of thinking is typical of the 19th century , when it led to wars over national honour .
austria 's der standard agrees .
" the players in the row are using outmoded systems of old nationalistic reflexes , " the paper says .
italians who vote for berlusconi are not all mafiosi and the northern league is not the whole of italy la stampa it urges gerhard schroeder to occupy the moral high ground by breaking what it calls " the vicious circle of artificial and calculating outrage " and spending his holiday in italy despite his cancellation .
mr schroeder might also have read the wednesday edition of the turin daily la stampa before he took his decision .
in an article taking the form of a letter , the paper begs an anonymous german friend not to cancel his annual holiday in italy .
" true , the psychological climate between germans and italians has not been ... so aggressive and vulgar for many decades , " it admits .
the paper says even mr stefani 's failed marriage to a german and membership of the northern league can not fully explain what it calls his " odious and almost obscene displays of racism " .
it insists that hoteliers and tourist guides in venice , tuscany and liguria do not share such attitudes .
" the italians who vote for berlusconi are not all mafiosi and the northern league is not the whole of italy , " the paper adds .
swiss democracy the geneva daily le temps hails as " courageous " the swiss federal court 's decision not to put foreigners ' citizenship applications to the public vote .
the magistrates ruled against what the paper calls " that direct democracy that serves a little too easily , in this country , as a supreme reference , a sacred cow , with solutions to all the problems of the swiss , " the paper says .
" democracy is not the violation of the constitution by the majority , " it adds .
and instead of sending the ball back into the politicians ' court the judges played their role to the full , the paper says .
" the most direct lesson that can be learned ... is that naturalization is no longer the act of sovereignty it used to be , but a more administrative than political decision , " it adds .
shopping for votes the hungarian daily nepszabadsag targets the policy of the main conservative opposition party , fidesz -lrb- hungarian civic alliance -rrb- , on women .
we are hardly ahead of cambodia , iraq or albania concerning the proportion of women in politics nepszabadsag fidesz chairman viktor orban cautioned the party 's newly founded female section against feminism , and called on them " to knit a net around the party as strong as a shopping net " , the paper says .
the paper contrasts this image of a net-like eastern european shopping bag -lrb- no longer in use -rrb- with the policy of the german conservative cdu-csu 's so-called frauen union , which , it says , " demands full equality in public life , work and family " .
" the situation has hardly changed in the east " , the commentary says , referring to party leaders on both ends of the political spectrum who see the role of women in politics mainly as one of maximizing votes .
" while we are hardly ahead of cambodia , iraq or albania concerning the proportion of women in politics , there is nothing to be surprised about in all this , " the paper concludes .
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

the six-week period ends on thursday - but it will take several weeks to assess the results .
edinburgh city council is proposing two tram routes linking the north and west of the capital with the city centre .
a more detailed public consultation exercise will be launched if the scheme wins the scottish parliament 's approval .
the proposed network is part of the integrated transport initiative , which plans an investment of more than £ 1bn over the next 15 years .
backers of the tram scheme argue that it is one of the best ways of tackling the capital 's congestion problems .
individuals and organisations have had an opportunity in recent weeks to submit their comments on the routing , and other aspects , of the first two lines .
the city 's last trams went out of service in 1956 .
the proposed north edinburgh loop would link the city centre with leith , newhaven and the waterfront area .
it is hoped a second route linking the haymarket area with edinburgh airport could also be created .
they would be part of a package of measures aimed at easing traffic congestion in the capital .

the acquisition would give nike access to converse 's retro style brands , such as its chuck taylor all star trainers .
this , combined with nike 's marketing machine , should help push both brands further , analysts predicted .
" retro styling has come back so strong , a lot stronger than i would have expected , " said robert toomey , an analyst for rbc dain rauscher .
" converse is one of the strongest footwear brands in the world with great heritage and a long history of success , " said tom clarke , nike 's president of new business ventures .
revival but that was not always so .
in 2001 , converse , which had invented the basketball shoe in the 1920s , filed for bankruptcy before being taken over by private investors who have since tried to rebuild the brand .
at the time , the brand was struggling , having long since been pushed out of the top league by nike and others .
its rubber-toed basketball shoes have enjoyed periods of popularity as a fashion icon , however .
and in recent years , converse has been making modern basketball shoes which have been well received by players .
scrutiny nike has agreed to pay $ 305m -lrb- £ 187m -rrb- for converse .
in addition , nike will take on some of converse 's liabilities .
the deal is subject to regulatory approval .
nike is huge when compared with converse .
last year , nike 's sales reached $ 10.7bn while converse 's sales stood at £ 205m .
