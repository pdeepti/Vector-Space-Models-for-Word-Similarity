in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .
that means several more months of uncertainty and hard lobbying for schröder and his allies . " it will require a big effort for a long time until just before christmas .

eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .
" of course we need a stronger european defense initiative , " said blair .
" but nothing should endanger the security guarantee provided by nato . "
british and polish defense experts believe that eu defense capabilities should be developed for use in the event that nato declines to act in a particular region or during a particular crisis .
others in the eu have more ambitious plans for european defense .
some , in particular france , envision a more independent european defense capability , and along with that , an independent planning facility .
a united front on economic issues despite the differences over constitutional and defense matters , the heads of state did manage to reach a consensus on two economic-related matters .
on friday , they announced a growth initiative aimed at boosting the european economy .
the statement cautiously backed a european commission proposal to aim public investment at cross-border transport , energy and research .
the funds diverted to the project would total more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.8 million -rrb- .
however , some economists say the initiative will do little to improve the economic situation in europe and more significant labor market , pension and welfare reforms are needed to breathe new life into the economy .
they also agreed on a new head of the european central bank .

eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .

eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .
" of course we need a stronger european defense initiative , " said blair .
" but nothing should endanger the security guarantee provided by nato . "
british and polish defense experts believe that eu defense capabilities should be developed for use in the event that nato declines to act in a particular region or during a particular crisis .
others in the eu have more ambitious plans for european defense .
some , in particular france , envision a more independent european defense capability , and along with that , an independent planning facility .
a united front on economic issues despite the differences over constitutional and defense matters , the heads of state did manage to reach a consensus on two economic-related matters .
on friday , they announced a growth initiative aimed at boosting the european economy .
the statement cautiously backed a european commission proposal to aim public investment at cross-border transport , energy and research .
the funds diverted to the project would total more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.8 million -rrb- .
however , some economists say the initiative will do little to improve the economic situation in europe and more significant labor market , pension and welfare reforms are needed to breathe new life into the economy .
they also agreed on a new head of the european central bank .
the french-born jean-claude trichet was officially named , and is scheduled to begin his tenure as the second head of the bank on november 1st .
he will replace dutchman wim duisenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de difficult constitution talks open in rome the conference in italy charged with the task of finishing negotiations for a european constitution convenes saturday .

the first chapter of the boy wizard ’ s fifth outing , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , will be printed in over 20 street magazines in germany , switzerland and austria ahead of the publication of the german translation of the book on november 8 .
the initiative was officially unveiled at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month .
author joanne k. rowling has broken her own golden rule of not releasing any hints or extracts from her phenomenally successful series by giving her approval for the chapter to appear first in the designated street newspapers , according to german publisher carlsen .

the writer , who first imagined the world of hogwarts school and the struggles between good and evil while an unemployed single mother living on welfare benefits , supports several charitable causes with her book sales and gave exclusive rights to the street newspapers in a bid to boost funding for the homeless and jobless projects the publications support .
" by giving newspapers sold for the homeless in german-speaking countries the right to print advance copies for free , it is giving them the chance to boost their circulation and awareness for the social concerns of such projects , " carlsen said in a statement .
a massive boost birgit müller , editor of hinz & kunzt , germany ’ s biggest-selling street magazine , said the offer from rowling 's publishers was a wonderful surprise and too good to refuse .

in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .
that means several more months of uncertainty and hard lobbying for schröder and his allies . " it will require a big effort for a long time until just before christmas .
that 's when the last votes will be , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering told wdr radio . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag to vote on controversial labor market reforms friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes .
-lrb- oct .
17 , 2003 -rrb- a quick guide to ‘ agenda 2010 ’ the government ’ s plan to boost the ailing economy focuses on reductions in health care benefits , restructuring labor regulations , tax cuts and an overhaul of the pension system .

in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .
that means several more months of uncertainty and hard lobbying for schröder and his allies . " it will require a big effort for a long time until just before christmas .
that 's when the last votes will be , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering told wdr radio . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag to vote on controversial labor market reforms friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .

in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .

eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .
" of course we need a stronger european defense initiative , " said blair .
" but nothing should endanger the security guarantee provided by nato . "
british and polish defense experts believe that eu defense capabilities should be developed for use in the event that nato declines to act in a particular region or during a particular crisis .
others in the eu have more ambitious plans for european defense .
some , in particular france , envision a more independent european defense capability , and along with that , an independent planning facility .

however , some economists say the initiative will do little to improve the economic situation in europe and more significant labor market , pension and welfare reforms are needed to breathe new life into the economy .

the first chapter of the boy wizard ’ s fifth outing , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , will be printed in over 20 street magazines in germany , switzerland and austria ahead of the publication of the german translation of the book on november 8 .
the initiative was officially unveiled at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month .
author joanne k. rowling has broken her own golden rule of not releasing any hints or extracts from her phenomenally successful series by giving her approval for the chapter to appear first in the designated street newspapers , according to german publisher carlsen .
author remembers the hard times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling , author of the " harry potter " books .
the writer , who first imagined the world of hogwarts school and the struggles between good and evil while an unemployed single mother living on welfare benefits , supports several charitable causes with her book sales and gave exclusive rights to the street newspapers in a bid to boost funding for the homeless and jobless projects the publications support .
" by giving newspapers sold for the homeless in german-speaking countries the right to print advance copies for free , it is giving them the chance to boost their circulation and awareness for the social concerns of such projects , " carlsen said in a statement .
a massive boost birgit müller , editor of hinz & kunzt , germany ’ s biggest-selling street magazine , said the offer from rowling 's publishers was a wonderful surprise and too good to refuse .
" it was the greatest gift to us to be able to publish the chapter , " she said .
" the vendors are over the moon .

the special potter edition of hinz & kunzt goes on sale in germany on october 25 .
it will cost € 1.50 -lrb- $ 1.75 -rrb- , of which 80 cents goes to the vendor .
the magazine and those others which will carry the exclusive preview are expecting massive demand for the copies , since kids of all ages will likely be clamouring to feast their eyes on the opening chapter of harry potter und der orden des phoenix .
huge demand a spokesman for the stütze homeless publication in berlin told the daily newspaper tagesspiegel that their offices had already been flooded with phone calls from across germany asking for copies to be mailed to them .
impatient german potter fans are likely to snap up the magazines in huge numbers if the latest book ’ s popularity and success in its original language is anything to go by .

the english version of the novel , published in june , has already stormed the bestseller charts in germany , selling some 500,000 copies .
the homeless papers getting the potter extracts are not the only ones who are expecting to benefit from harry ’ s latest arrival in his german-speaking form .
german booksellers are hoping that the launch of the translated edition will spark a much-needed revival in a book market currently afflicted with economic malaise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.10.2003 german parliament backs labor reform plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relieved schröder - the vote went his way .
in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .

although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.10.2003 harry potter brings magic to the homeless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait is almost over for germany 's impatient potter fans two weeks before the fifth harry potter book gets its german-language release , fans will be able to satisfy their curiosity and help the poor at the same time when the first chapter appears in 21 charitable publications . underprivileged german-speaking muggles are set to get a bit of help from harry potter when the opening excerpts from his latest adventure appear in magazines sold by homeless people starting next week .
the first chapter of the boy wizard ’ s fifth outing , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , will be printed in over 20 street magazines in germany , switzerland and austria ahead of the publication of the german translation of the book on november 8 .
the initiative was officially unveiled at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month .
author joanne k. rowling has broken her own golden rule of not releasing any hints or extracts from her phenomenally successful series by giving her approval for the chapter to appear first in the designated street newspapers , according to german publisher carlsen .
author remembers the hard times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling , author of the " harry potter " books .
the writer , who first imagined the world of hogwarts school and the struggles between good and evil while an unemployed single mother living on welfare benefits , supports several charitable causes with her book sales and gave exclusive rights to the street newspapers in a bid to boost funding for the homeless and jobless projects the publications support .
" by giving newspapers sold for the homeless in german-speaking countries the right to print advance copies for free , it is giving them the chance to boost their circulation and awareness for the social concerns of such projects , " carlsen said in a statement .
a massive boost birgit müller , editor of hinz & kunzt , germany ’ s biggest-selling street magazine , said the offer from rowling 's publishers was a wonderful surprise and too good to refuse .
" it was the greatest gift to us to be able to publish the chapter , " she said .
" the vendors are over the moon .
it will give us a massive boost . "
the special potter edition of hinz & kunzt goes on sale in germany on october 25 .
it will cost € 1.50 -lrb- $ 1.75 -rrb- , of which 80 cents goes to the vendor .
the magazine and those others which will carry the exclusive preview are expecting massive demand for the copies , since kids of all ages will likely be clamouring to feast their eyes on the opening chapter of harry potter und der orden des phoenix .

eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .
" of course we need a stronger european defense initiative , " said blair .
" but nothing should endanger the security guarantee provided by nato . "
british and polish defense experts believe that eu defense capabilities should be developed for use in the event that nato declines to act in a particular region or during a particular crisis .
others in the eu have more ambitious plans for european defense .
some , in particular france , envision a more independent european defense capability , and along with that , an independent planning facility .

eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .
" of course we need a stronger european defense initiative , " said blair .
" but nothing should endanger the security guarantee provided by nato . "
british and polish defense experts believe that eu defense capabilities should be developed for use in the event that nato declines to act in a particular region or during a particular crisis .
others in the eu have more ambitious plans for european defense .
some , in particular france , envision a more independent european defense capability , and along with that , an independent planning facility .
a united front on economic issues despite the differences over constitutional and defense matters , the heads of state did manage to reach a consensus on two economic-related matters .
on friday , they announced a growth initiative aimed at boosting the european economy .
the statement cautiously backed a european commission proposal to aim public investment at cross-border transport , energy and research .
the funds diverted to the project would total more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.8 million -rrb- .
however , some economists say the initiative will do little to improve the economic situation in europe and more significant labor market , pension and welfare reforms are needed to breathe new life into the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.10.2003 harry potter brings magic to the homeless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait is almost over for germany 's impatient potter fans two weeks before the fifth harry potter book gets its german-language release , fans will be able to satisfy their curiosity and help the poor at the same time when the first chapter appears in 21 charitable publications . underprivileged german-speaking muggles are set to get a bit of help from harry potter when the opening excerpts from his latest adventure appear in magazines sold by homeless people starting next week .
the first chapter of the boy wizard ’ s fifth outing , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , will be printed in over 20 street magazines in germany , switzerland and austria ahead of the publication of the german translation of the book on november 8 .
the initiative was officially unveiled at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month .
author joanne k. rowling has broken her own golden rule of not releasing any hints or extracts from her phenomenally successful series by giving her approval for the chapter to appear first in the designated street newspapers , according to german publisher carlsen .
author remembers the hard times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling , author of the " harry potter " books .
the writer , who first imagined the world of hogwarts school and the struggles between good and evil while an unemployed single mother living on welfare benefits , supports several charitable causes with her book sales and gave exclusive rights to the street newspapers in a bid to boost funding for the homeless and jobless projects the publications support .
" by giving newspapers sold for the homeless in german-speaking countries the right to print advance copies for free , it is giving them the chance to boost their circulation and awareness for the social concerns of such projects , " carlsen said in a statement .
a massive boost birgit müller , editor of hinz & kunzt , germany ’ s biggest-selling street magazine , said the offer from rowling 's publishers was a wonderful surprise and too good to refuse .
" it was the greatest gift to us to be able to publish the chapter , " she said .
" the vendors are over the moon .
it will give us a massive boost . "
the special potter edition of hinz & kunzt goes on sale in germany on october 25 .
it will cost € 1.50 -lrb- $ 1.75 -rrb- , of which 80 cents goes to the vendor .
the magazine and those others which will carry the exclusive preview are expecting massive demand for the copies , since kids of all ages will likely be clamouring to feast their eyes on the opening chapter of harry potter und der orden des phoenix .
huge demand a spokesman for the stütze homeless publication in berlin told the daily newspaper tagesspiegel that their offices had already been flooded with phone calls from across germany asking for copies to be mailed to them .
impatient german potter fans are likely to snap up the magazines in huge numbers if the latest book ’ s popularity and success in its original language is anything to go by .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english language edition flew off the shelves on publication .
the english version of the novel , published in june , has already stormed the bestseller charts in germany , selling some 500,000 copies .
the homeless papers getting the potter extracts are not the only ones who are expecting to benefit from harry ’ s latest arrival in his german-speaking form .
german booksellers are hoping that the launch of the translated edition will spark a much-needed revival in a book market currently afflicted with economic malaise .
potter hope for book sales book sales in germany recorded a 4.9 percent year on year drop in august but experts believe christmas business and the “ harry potter effect “ would probably less the pain reduced that number to 2 percent come the end of the year .
previous potter releases had boosted annual sales of some retailers by as much as 5 percent .
but not everybody is happy at the magic harry and his friends are about to weave on the funds of the 21 publications granted the publishing rights .
an unnamed representative for a competing homeless publication that is not among the chosen group complained about unfair competition .
" this will mean a drop in sales for us , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de publishers hope book fair will help ailing industry the world 's biggest trade fair for books opens on tuesday evening in frankfurt / main .

the first chapter of the boy wizard ’ s fifth outing , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , will be printed in over 20 street magazines in germany , switzerland and austria ahead of the publication of the german translation of the book on november 8 .
the initiative was officially unveiled at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month .
author joanne k. rowling has broken her own golden rule of not releasing any hints or extracts from her phenomenally successful series by giving her approval for the chapter to appear first in the designated street newspapers , according to german publisher carlsen .
author remembers the hard times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling , author of the " harry potter " books .
the writer , who first imagined the world of hogwarts school and the struggles between good and evil while an unemployed single mother living on welfare benefits , supports several charitable causes with her book sales and gave exclusive rights to the street newspapers in a bid to boost funding for the homeless and jobless projects the publications support .
" by giving newspapers sold for the homeless in german-speaking countries the right to print advance copies for free , it is giving them the chance to boost their circulation and awareness for the social concerns of such projects , " carlsen said in a statement .
a massive boost birgit müller , editor of hinz & kunzt , germany ’ s biggest-selling street magazine , said the offer from rowling 's publishers was a wonderful surprise and too good to refuse .
" it was the greatest gift to us to be able to publish the chapter , " she said .
" the vendors are over the moon .
it will give us a massive boost . "
the special potter edition of hinz & kunzt goes on sale in germany on october 25 .
it will cost € 1.50 -lrb- $ 1.75 -rrb- , of which 80 cents goes to the vendor .
the magazine and those others which will carry the exclusive preview are expecting massive demand for the copies , since kids of all ages will likely be clamouring to feast their eyes on the opening chapter of harry potter und der orden des phoenix .
huge demand a spokesman for the stütze homeless publication in berlin told the daily newspaper tagesspiegel that their offices had already been flooded with phone calls from across germany asking for copies to be mailed to them .
impatient german potter fans are likely to snap up the magazines in huge numbers if the latest book ’ s popularity and success in its original language is anything to go by .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english language edition flew off the shelves on publication .
the english version of the novel , published in june , has already stormed the bestseller charts in germany , selling some 500,000 copies .
the homeless papers getting the potter extracts are not the only ones who are expecting to benefit from harry ’ s latest arrival in his german-speaking form .
german booksellers are hoping that the launch of the translated edition will spark a much-needed revival in a book market currently afflicted with economic malaise .
potter hope for book sales book sales in germany recorded a 4.9 percent year on year drop in august but experts believe christmas business and the “ harry potter effect “ would probably less the pain reduced that number to 2 percent come the end of the year .
previous potter releases had boosted annual sales of some retailers by as much as 5 percent .
but not everybody is happy at the magic harry and his friends are about to weave on the funds of the 21 publications granted the publishing rights .
an unnamed representative for a competing homeless publication that is not among the chosen group complained about unfair competition .

in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .
that means several more months of uncertainty and hard lobbying for schröder and his allies . " it will require a big effort for a long time until just before christmas .

his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .

although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .
that means several more months of uncertainty and hard lobbying for schröder and his allies . " it will require a big effort for a long time until just before christmas .
that 's when the last votes will be , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering told wdr radio . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag to vote on controversial labor market reforms friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes .

eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .
" of course we need a stronger european defense initiative , " said blair .
" but nothing should endanger the security guarantee provided by nato . "
british and polish defense experts believe that eu defense capabilities should be developed for use in the event that nato declines to act in a particular region or during a particular crisis .
others in the eu have more ambitious plans for european defense .
some , in particular france , envision a more independent european defense capability , and along with that , an independent planning facility .
a united front on economic issues despite the differences over constitutional and defense matters , the heads of state did manage to reach a consensus on two economic-related matters .
on friday , they announced a growth initiative aimed at boosting the european economy .
the statement cautiously backed a european commission proposal to aim public investment at cross-border transport , energy and research .
the funds diverted to the project would total more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.8 million -rrb- .
however , some economists say the initiative will do little to improve the economic situation in europe and more significant labor market , pension and welfare reforms are needed to breathe new life into the economy .
they also agreed on a new head of the european central bank .

in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .
that means several more months of uncertainty and hard lobbying for schröder and his allies . " it will require a big effort for a long time until just before christmas .
that 's when the last votes will be , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering told wdr radio . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag to vote on controversial labor market reforms friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .
schröder has reined in rebellious members of his own party , but a green , a member of the government 's coalition partner , says he wo n't vote yes .
-lrb- oct .
17 , 2003 -rrb- a quick guide to ‘ agenda 2010 ’ the government ’ s plan to boost the ailing economy focuses on reductions in health care benefits , restructuring labor regulations , tax cuts and an overhaul of the pension system .

the first chapter of the boy wizard ’ s fifth outing , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , will be printed in over 20 street magazines in germany , switzerland and austria ahead of the publication of the german translation of the book on november 8 .
the initiative was officially unveiled at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month .

eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .
" of course we need a stronger european defense initiative , " said blair .
" but nothing should endanger the security guarantee provided by nato . "
british and polish defense experts believe that eu defense capabilities should be developed for use in the event that nato declines to act in a particular region or during a particular crisis .
others in the eu have more ambitious plans for european defense .
some , in particular france , envision a more independent european defense capability , and along with that , an independent planning facility .
a united front on economic issues despite the differences over constitutional and defense matters , the heads of state did manage to reach a consensus on two economic-related matters .
on friday , they announced a growth initiative aimed at boosting the european economy .
the statement cautiously backed a european commission proposal to aim public investment at cross-border transport , energy and research .
the funds diverted to the project would total more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.8 million -rrb- .
however , some economists say the initiative will do little to improve the economic situation in europe and more significant labor market , pension and welfare reforms are needed to breathe new life into the economy .
they also agreed on a new head of the european central bank .
the french-born jean-claude trichet was officially named , and is scheduled to begin his tenure as the second head of the bank on november 1st .
he will replace dutchman wim duisenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de difficult constitution talks open in rome the conference in italy charged with the task of finishing negotiations for a european constitution convenes saturday .

despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .

in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .
that means several more months of uncertainty and hard lobbying for schröder and his allies . " it will require a big effort for a long time until just before christmas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.10.2003 harry potter brings magic to the homeless großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wait is almost over for germany 's impatient potter fans two weeks before the fifth harry potter book gets its german-language release , fans will be able to satisfy their curiosity and help the poor at the same time when the first chapter appears in 21 charitable publications . underprivileged german-speaking muggles are set to get a bit of help from harry potter when the opening excerpts from his latest adventure appear in magazines sold by homeless people starting next week .
the first chapter of the boy wizard ’ s fifth outing , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , will be printed in over 20 street magazines in germany , switzerland and austria ahead of the publication of the german translation of the book on november 8 .
the initiative was officially unveiled at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month .
author joanne k. rowling has broken her own golden rule of not releasing any hints or extracts from her phenomenally successful series by giving her approval for the chapter to appear first in the designated street newspapers , according to german publisher carlsen .
author remembers the hard times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling , author of the " harry potter " books .
the writer , who first imagined the world of hogwarts school and the struggles between good and evil while an unemployed single mother living on welfare benefits , supports several charitable causes with her book sales and gave exclusive rights to the street newspapers in a bid to boost funding for the homeless and jobless projects the publications support .
" by giving newspapers sold for the homeless in german-speaking countries the right to print advance copies for free , it is giving them the chance to boost their circulation and awareness for the social concerns of such projects , " carlsen said in a statement .
a massive boost birgit müller , editor of hinz & kunzt , germany ’ s biggest-selling street magazine , said the offer from rowling 's publishers was a wonderful surprise and too good to refuse .
" it was the greatest gift to us to be able to publish the chapter , " she said .
" the vendors are over the moon .
it will give us a massive boost . "
the special potter edition of hinz & kunzt goes on sale in germany on october 25 .
it will cost € 1.50 -lrb- $ 1.75 -rrb- , of which 80 cents goes to the vendor .
the magazine and those others which will carry the exclusive preview are expecting massive demand for the copies , since kids of all ages will likely be clamouring to feast their eyes on the opening chapter of harry potter und der orden des phoenix .
huge demand a spokesman for the stütze homeless publication in berlin told the daily newspaper tagesspiegel that their offices had already been flooded with phone calls from across germany asking for copies to be mailed to them .
impatient german potter fans are likely to snap up the magazines in huge numbers if the latest book ’ s popularity and success in its original language is anything to go by .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english language edition flew off the shelves on publication .
the english version of the novel , published in june , has already stormed the bestseller charts in germany , selling some 500,000 copies .
the homeless papers getting the potter extracts are not the only ones who are expecting to benefit from harry ’ s latest arrival in his german-speaking form .
german booksellers are hoping that the launch of the translated edition will spark a much-needed revival in a book market currently afflicted with economic malaise .
potter hope for book sales book sales in germany recorded a 4.9 percent year on year drop in august but experts believe christmas business and the “ harry potter effect “ would probably less the pain reduced that number to 2 percent come the end of the year .
previous potter releases had boosted annual sales of some retailers by as much as 5 percent .

the first chapter of the boy wizard ’ s fifth outing , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , will be printed in over 20 street magazines in germany , switzerland and austria ahead of the publication of the german translation of the book on november 8 .
the initiative was officially unveiled at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month .
author joanne k. rowling has broken her own golden rule of not releasing any hints or extracts from her phenomenally successful series by giving her approval for the chapter to appear first in the designated street newspapers , according to german publisher carlsen .
author remembers the hard times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling , author of the " harry potter " books .
the writer , who first imagined the world of hogwarts school and the struggles between good and evil while an unemployed single mother living on welfare benefits , supports several charitable causes with her book sales and gave exclusive rights to the street newspapers in a bid to boost funding for the homeless and jobless projects the publications support .
" by giving newspapers sold for the homeless in german-speaking countries the right to print advance copies for free , it is giving them the chance to boost their circulation and awareness for the social concerns of such projects , " carlsen said in a statement .
a massive boost birgit müller , editor of hinz & kunzt , germany ’ s biggest-selling street magazine , said the offer from rowling 's publishers was a wonderful surprise and too good to refuse .
" it was the greatest gift to us to be able to publish the chapter , " she said .
" the vendors are over the moon .
it will give us a massive boost . "
the special potter edition of hinz & kunzt goes on sale in germany on october 25 .
it will cost € 1.50 -lrb- $ 1.75 -rrb- , of which 80 cents goes to the vendor .
the magazine and those others which will carry the exclusive preview are expecting massive demand for the copies , since kids of all ages will likely be clamouring to feast their eyes on the opening chapter of harry potter und der orden des phoenix .
huge demand a spokesman for the stütze homeless publication in berlin told the daily newspaper tagesspiegel that their offices had already been flooded with phone calls from across germany asking for copies to be mailed to them .
impatient german potter fans are likely to snap up the magazines in huge numbers if the latest book ’ s popularity and success in its original language is anything to go by .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english language edition flew off the shelves on publication .
the english version of the novel , published in june , has already stormed the bestseller charts in germany , selling some 500,000 copies .
the homeless papers getting the potter extracts are not the only ones who are expecting to benefit from harry ’ s latest arrival in his german-speaking form .
german booksellers are hoping that the launch of the translated edition will spark a much-needed revival in a book market currently afflicted with economic malaise .
potter hope for book sales book sales in germany recorded a 4.9 percent year on year drop in august but experts believe christmas business and the “ harry potter effect “ would probably less the pain reduced that number to 2 percent come the end of the year .
previous potter releases had boosted annual sales of some retailers by as much as 5 percent .
but not everybody is happy at the magic harry and his friends are about to weave on the funds of the 21 publications granted the publishing rights .

in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .
that means several more months of uncertainty and hard lobbying for schröder and his allies . " it will require a big effort for a long time until just before christmas .

duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .
that means several more months of uncertainty and hard lobbying for schröder and his allies . " it will require a big effort for a long time until just before christmas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2003 little to show after eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking for two - french president jacques chirac represented germany at the eu summit .
eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .
" of course we need a stronger european defense initiative , " said blair .
" but nothing should endanger the security guarantee provided by nato . "
british and polish defense experts believe that eu defense capabilities should be developed for use in the event that nato declines to act in a particular region or during a particular crisis .
others in the eu have more ambitious plans for european defense .
some , in particular france , envision a more independent european defense capability , and along with that , an independent planning facility .
a united front on economic issues despite the differences over constitutional and defense matters , the heads of state did manage to reach a consensus on two economic-related matters .
on friday , they announced a growth initiative aimed at boosting the european economy .
the statement cautiously backed a european commission proposal to aim public investment at cross-border transport , energy and research .
the funds diverted to the project would total more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.8 million -rrb- .
however , some economists say the initiative will do little to improve the economic situation in europe and more significant labor market , pension and welfare reforms are needed to breathe new life into the economy .
they also agreed on a new head of the european central bank .
the french-born jean-claude trichet was officially named , and is scheduled to begin his tenure as the second head of the bank on november 1st .
he will replace dutchman wim duisenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de difficult constitution talks open in rome the conference in italy charged with the task of finishing negotiations for a european constitution convenes saturday .

the first chapter of the boy wizard ’ s fifth outing , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , will be printed in over 20 street magazines in germany , switzerland and austria ahead of the publication of the german translation of the book on november 8 .
the initiative was officially unveiled at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month .

in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .
that means several more months of uncertainty and hard lobbying for schröder and his allies . " it will require a big effort for a long time until just before christmas .
that 's when the last votes will be , " spd parliamentary floor leader franz müntefering told wdr radio . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag to vote on controversial labor market reforms friday 's vote in the bundestag on labor market reforms will be close .

in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2003 little to show after eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking for two - french president jacques chirac represented germany at the eu summit .
eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .

eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .

eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .
" of course we need a stronger european defense initiative , " said blair .
" but nothing should endanger the security guarantee provided by nato . "
british and polish defense experts believe that eu defense capabilities should be developed for use in the event that nato declines to act in a particular region or during a particular crisis .
others in the eu have more ambitious plans for european defense .
some , in particular france , envision a more independent european defense capability , and along with that , an independent planning facility .
a united front on economic issues despite the differences over constitutional and defense matters , the heads of state did manage to reach a consensus on two economic-related matters .
on friday , they announced a growth initiative aimed at boosting the european economy .
the statement cautiously backed a european commission proposal to aim public investment at cross-border transport , energy and research .
the funds diverted to the project would total more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.8 million -rrb- .
however , some economists say the initiative will do little to improve the economic situation in europe and more significant labor market , pension and welfare reforms are needed to breathe new life into the economy .
they also agreed on a new head of the european central bank .
the french-born jean-claude trichet was officially named , and is scheduled to begin his tenure as the second head of the bank on november 1st .
he will replace dutchman wim duisenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de difficult constitution talks open in rome the conference in italy charged with the task of finishing negotiations for a european constitution convenes saturday .

the first chapter of the boy wizard ’ s fifth outing , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , will be printed in over 20 street magazines in germany , switzerland and austria ahead of the publication of the german translation of the book on november 8 .
the initiative was officially unveiled at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month .
author joanne k. rowling has broken her own golden rule of not releasing any hints or extracts from her phenomenally successful series by giving her approval for the chapter to appear first in the designated street newspapers , according to german publisher carlsen .
author remembers the hard times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling , author of the " harry potter " books .
the writer , who first imagined the world of hogwarts school and the struggles between good and evil while an unemployed single mother living on welfare benefits , supports several charitable causes with her book sales and gave exclusive rights to the street newspapers in a bid to boost funding for the homeless and jobless projects the publications support .
" by giving newspapers sold for the homeless in german-speaking countries the right to print advance copies for free , it is giving them the chance to boost their circulation and awareness for the social concerns of such projects , " carlsen said in a statement .
a massive boost birgit müller , editor of hinz & kunzt , germany ’ s biggest-selling street magazine , said the offer from rowling 's publishers was a wonderful surprise and too good to refuse .

it will cost € 1.50 -lrb- $ 1.75 -rrb- , of which 80 cents goes to the vendor .
the magazine and those others which will carry the exclusive preview are expecting massive demand for the copies , since kids of all ages will likely be clamouring to feast their eyes on the opening chapter of harry potter und der orden des phoenix .
huge demand a spokesman for the stütze homeless publication in berlin told the daily newspaper tagesspiegel that their offices had already been flooded with phone calls from across germany asking for copies to be mailed to them .

in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .
that means several more months of uncertainty and hard lobbying for schröder and his allies . " it will require a big effort for a long time until just before christmas .

eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .
" of course we need a stronger european defense initiative , " said blair .
" but nothing should endanger the security guarantee provided by nato . "
british and polish defense experts believe that eu defense capabilities should be developed for use in the event that nato declines to act in a particular region or during a particular crisis .
others in the eu have more ambitious plans for european defense .
some , in particular france , envision a more independent european defense capability , and along with that , an independent planning facility .
a united front on economic issues despite the differences over constitutional and defense matters , the heads of state did manage to reach a consensus on two economic-related matters .
on friday , they announced a growth initiative aimed at boosting the european economy .
the statement cautiously backed a european commission proposal to aim public investment at cross-border transport , energy and research .
the funds diverted to the project would total more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.8 million -rrb- .
however , some economists say the initiative will do little to improve the economic situation in europe and more significant labor market , pension and welfare reforms are needed to breathe new life into the economy .
they also agreed on a new head of the european central bank .
the french-born jean-claude trichet was officially named , and is scheduled to begin his tenure as the second head of the bank on november 1st .

in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .

going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .

this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .
" of course we need a stronger european defense initiative , " said blair .
" but nothing should endanger the security guarantee provided by nato . "
british and polish defense experts believe that eu defense capabilities should be developed for use in the event that nato declines to act in a particular region or during a particular crisis .

eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .

in a close vote , the bundestag has approved chancellor schröder 's plans for labor market reform and tax cuts .
his own social democrats ended up falling in behind their leader , even though six had threatened to revolt . it was something of a reprieve for gerhard schröder , who had staked his political future on the outcome of friday 's vote over his plans to overhaul germany 's welfare state .
although controversial , in the end , the plans squeaked by with slim majorities . 306 deputies voted for and 291 voted against the so-called hartz iv law which cuts some job benefits and incurs penalties to long-termed unemployed who do not accept jobs offered to them .
the hartz iii law , which restructures germany 's labor agency , passed 304 to 294 . although it was tense in the lead-up , the vote fell largely as expected .
gerhard schröder was successful in quelling a rebellion within his own ranks after six left-leaning members of his spd party threatened to vote against the plans .
schröder had threatened to resign if that happened , but a last-minute softening of some of the measures was enough to convince the rebellious deputies to fall back into line .
one member of the green party , werner schulz , abstained . schröder had cut short an eu summit in brussels on friday to get back for the vote and ensure he got his majority .
the opposition , made up of the christian democrats , the christian social union , the free democrats and the party of democratic socialism , had long announced its opposition to the measures . goal : kick-starting the economy the reforms are a key part of schröder 's " agenda 2010 " package of reforms which is designed to pull germany out of three years of economic stagnation .
while the country is showing some signs of economic recovery and emerging from its second recession in as many years , experts still expect the economy to be flat this year .
schröder hopes that loosening some of germany 's rigid labor market rules and bringing tax cuts forward a year to boost consumption will provide a badly needed kick-start and help the country shake off its reputation as the " sick man " of europe . key elements of the plan include restructuring the federal labor agency , cutting benefits for unemployed people and penalizing those who refuse to take jobs offered to them by government-administered employment agencies .
duties on tobacco will be increased , adding about 33 percent to a package of cigarettes , and € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in tax cuts will be brought forward to 2004 .
hours before members of the bundestag had to make up their minds , federal labor minister wolfgang clement appealed for their support .
clement defended the reform package , the controversial measures were " central features of our fight against this country 's oppressive unemployment situation . "
unemployment in germany threatens to hit a postwar high this winter and government officials say the reforms could cut the number of unemployed by 10 to 15 percent .
" we need a new approach to the labor market , " clement told parliament .
" we have to free up investment and consumption .
that 's why we have to make sure that taxes and labor costs are reduced . "
while the reform plans would bring unpleasant cuts to germans used to their generous welfare state , most have come to the painful conclusion that things can not go on as they are .
unsurprisingly , tax cuts are popular , but many say even a planned overhaul of the overburdened health system is unavoidable .
a recent survey by the polling firm forsa showed that almost half of germans said the country needed to take more action to haul itself out of stagnation . not their final form although the reform plan passed a crucial hurdle today , it still has to make it through the opposition-controlled upper house , the bundesrat , before being made into law .
opposition parties have said the reforms do not go far enough and have promised to beef them up when the reform plans go before lawmakers there .
that means several more months of uncertainty and hard lobbying for schröder and his allies . " it will require a big effort for a long time until just before christmas .

the first chapter of the boy wizard ’ s fifth outing , harry potter and the order of the phoenix , will be printed in over 20 street magazines in germany , switzerland and austria ahead of the publication of the german translation of the book on november 8 .
the initiative was officially unveiled at the frankfurt book fair earlier this month .
author joanne k. rowling has broken her own golden rule of not releasing any hints or extracts from her phenomenally successful series by giving her approval for the chapter to appear first in the designated street newspapers , according to german publisher carlsen .
author remembers the hard times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.k. rowling , author of the " harry potter " books .
the writer , who first imagined the world of hogwarts school and the struggles between good and evil while an unemployed single mother living on welfare benefits , supports several charitable causes with her book sales and gave exclusive rights to the street newspapers in a bid to boost funding for the homeless and jobless projects the publications support .
" by giving newspapers sold for the homeless in german-speaking countries the right to print advance copies for free , it is giving them the chance to boost their circulation and awareness for the social concerns of such projects , " carlsen said in a statement .
a massive boost birgit müller , editor of hinz & kunzt , germany ’ s biggest-selling street magazine , said the offer from rowling 's publishers was a wonderful surprise and too good to refuse .
" it was the greatest gift to us to be able to publish the chapter , " she said .
" the vendors are over the moon .
it will give us a massive boost . "
the special potter edition of hinz & kunzt goes on sale in germany on october 25 .
it will cost € 1.50 -lrb- $ 1.75 -rrb- , of which 80 cents goes to the vendor .
the magazine and those others which will carry the exclusive preview are expecting massive demand for the copies , since kids of all ages will likely be clamouring to feast their eyes on the opening chapter of harry potter und der orden des phoenix .
huge demand a spokesman for the stütze homeless publication in berlin told the daily newspaper tagesspiegel that their offices had already been flooded with phone calls from across germany asking for copies to be mailed to them .
impatient german potter fans are likely to snap up the magazines in huge numbers if the latest book ’ s popularity and success in its original language is anything to go by .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english language edition flew off the shelves on publication .
the english version of the novel , published in june , has already stormed the bestseller charts in germany , selling some 500,000 copies .
the homeless papers getting the potter extracts are not the only ones who are expecting to benefit from harry ’ s latest arrival in his german-speaking form .
german booksellers are hoping that the launch of the translated edition will spark a much-needed revival in a book market currently afflicted with economic malaise .
potter hope for book sales book sales in germany recorded a 4.9 percent year on year drop in august but experts believe christmas business and the “ harry potter effect “ would probably less the pain reduced that number to 2 percent come the end of the year .
previous potter releases had boosted annual sales of some retailers by as much as 5 percent .
but not everybody is happy at the magic harry and his friends are about to weave on the funds of the 21 publications granted the publishing rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.10.2003 little to show after eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking for two - french president jacques chirac represented germany at the eu summit .
eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared . the leaders of current and future eu member states left their two-day meeting in brussels without making much progress on several key eu issues , such as agreeing on a constitution for the eu or settling their differences over european defense policy .
absent from the second day of the meetings was german chancellor gerhard schröder , who flew back to berlin early for a crucial labor-market reform vote .
in an unusual move , the german position was represented by french president jacques chirac , a sign that relations between the two countries are particularly warm at the moment .
despite the meager progress on key eu issues , the leaders did signal their support for an economic growth initiative and named a new head of the european central bank .
going in circles over the constitution in the weeks leading up to the summit , experts had predicted that there would be no major breakthroughs on the eu constitution deadlock .
the draft constitution - worked out by representatives from each of the eu 's current 15 members and 10 future members at the special convention on the future of europe - has proven to be one of the eu 's most contentious issues .
the document calls for fundamental changes to the eu 's current structure and is meant to ensure that the organization continues to function smoothly after next year 's enlargement .
however , the recommendations were not warmly received by all members .
smaller states have accused the larger ones - namely germany , france , britain and italy - of a power grab , and worry that they will lose influence .
at issue are two key points : the size of the european commission and voting procedures .
many eu members not among the " big four " would like to retain the current arrangement within the european commission , with each state allocated one permanent representative .
the draft constitution proposes for efficiency 's sake trimming the size of the commission to 15 members , with members rotating in and out .
the document also proposes changing the eu 's voting procedures from the current majority voting system to the so-called " double majority " voting system , with the support of half the members of the eu representing 60 percent of the population required to carry a proposal through .
poland and spain have taken particular issue with this proposal , preferring the current system , wherein each country enjoys weighted voting rights , which gives them influence comparable to germany , although their populations are smaller .
" we see no possibility of departing from nice , " polish prime minister leszek miller told reporters , referring to the treaty of nice , which codified the current system .
at the summit , no compromise was reached and old positions were simply restated .
this has led some to question whether of not the differences can be worked out by the end of the year , when italy , the current holder of the eu 's rotating presidency , hopes to wrap up negotiations and send a final version of the constitution off for ratification by member states .
" this morning has not taken it all in any way forward , " sweden 's prime minister goran persson told reporters .
" it is my assessment . that we will need time also during the irish presidency -lrb- which starts in january -rrb- .
i can not imagine that this will be ready by december . "
all the same , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi says he will press on and is optimistic that he can adhere to the december timeline .
he suggested he might call a special informal meeting in november to address the remaining differences .
a fight brewing over european defense the further development of european defense also proved divisive .
at a small summit in brussels last april , germany , france , belgium and luxembourg proposed the creation of a military command headquarters for the eu , separate from nato .
such a move has raised alarms in washington .
this idea is also very unpopular with the british prime minister tony blair , who reaffirmed his support for nato and the organization 's central role as the provider of european security .
" of course we need a stronger european defense initiative , " said blair .
" but nothing should endanger the security guarantee provided by nato . "
british and polish defense experts believe that eu defense capabilities should be developed for use in the event that nato declines to act in a particular region or during a particular crisis .
others in the eu have more ambitious plans for european defense .
some , in particular france , envision a more independent european defense capability , and along with that , an independent planning facility .
a united front on economic issues despite the differences over constitutional and defense matters , the heads of state did manage to reach a consensus on two economic-related matters .
on friday , they announced a growth initiative aimed at boosting the european economy .
the statement cautiously backed a european commission proposal to aim public investment at cross-border transport , energy and research .
the funds diverted to the project would total more than € 5 billion -lrb- $ 5.8 million -rrb- .
however , some economists say the initiative will do little to improve the economic situation in europe and more significant labor market , pension and welfare reforms are needed to breathe new life into the economy .
they also agreed on a new head of the european central bank .
the french-born jean-claude trichet was officially named , and is scheduled to begin his tenure as the second head of the bank on november 1st .
he will replace dutchman wim duisenberg . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de difficult constitution talks open in rome the conference in italy charged with the task of finishing negotiations for a european constitution convenes saturday .

the 58-year-old told the mirror newspaper that she was abused " not once either , several times " .
she recalled that the " terribly upsetting and disturbing " attacks happened between the ages of 16 and 25 , leaving her distrustful of men .
" i was being pursued by them purely for sex and absolutely nothing else , " she said , adding that she came to regard men as " so vile and so cruel and alien and nasty " .
she said : " i felt most men despised me as a person ... it was like i was a piece of meat .
in the end i realised that guys really were capable of this . "
few attacks reported a home office report published earlier this year suggested that one in 20 women in england and wales has been the victim of rape .
those new figures suggest 167 women are raped every day , but only one in five attacks is reported to the police .
currently only one in 13 cases ends with a conviction .

the row broke out after greek television stations aired a clip of mr simitis - apparently unaware of nearby cameras - talking to mr blair about the marbles at the sidelines of the european union summit in brussels on thursday .
" tony , i would like to discuss with you about the marbles ... as you know we have elections next year in greece .
maybe this could be useful , " mr simitis was seen telling mr blair .
the opposition accused mr simitis of exploiting " the great national issue " , referring to greece 's long campaign for the return of the 5th century sculptures from the british museum in london .
" mr simitis admitted in brussels that he is losing the election , " said thodors roussopoulos , spokesman for the opposition new democracy party .
" it is sad for him to use a national issue , such as the return of the parthenon marbles , for petty party-political ends . "
the marbles were removed from greece nearly 200 years ago the greek media also had a field day on friday .
" tony , send me the marbles , i have elections , " read a headline in the daily kathimerini , while the front page of ta nea 's newspaper had an article entitled " codename : marbles for elections " .
mr simitis defended himself by telling reporters that he wanted to point out to mr blair that there was not much time left to reach a deal on the marbles before the athens olympics in 2004 .
mr simitis ' panhellenic socialist movement -lrb- pasok -rrb- hopes to secure a fourth consecutive term in the election , which is due next spring .
the pasok has been trailing the new democracy party for more than a year in several opinion polls .
the marbles - depicting gods , men and monsters - were removed from athens ' parthenon in 1811 by lord elgin , the british ambassador to the ottoman empire that controlled greece at the time .

most of the uk 's leading charities use this face-to-face fundraising method , which is worth almost a quarter of a billion pounds a year .
collectors approach people in the street and ask them to set up a standing order for a regular donation .
but the charity watchdog for england and wales , the charity commission , has received a number of complaints from the public about the tactics being used . "
they must tell you they are paid and they must tell you they do not work directly for the charity " anthony robbins , charity commission earlier this year it issued a warning to its members to carefully monitor any agency it employs , after one company in brighton was found to be breaking the law .
anthony robbins , head of communications at the charity commission explained : " the face-to-face fundraisers must tell you they are paid , and they must tell you they do not work directly for the charity .

scope , and the mental health charity rethink , admitted it can be as little as 10 % .
most charities refused to talk to money box about the issue , but shelter fundraising director alan gosschalk told the programme he knows face-to-face fundraising can be unpopular , but says it is a valuable way of getting support : " charities are having to compete to get their name known and street fundraising , is a great way for them to do so " peter gilheaney , giving campaign " on average people that support us with a direct debit would do so for five years or more .
" that helps us to plan ahead and gives us stability in our income . "
and he continued : " if we were for example to recruit 10 new supporters today , we may be paying an agency something like £ 500 in costs .
" what we know is , on average , over the lifetime of their support , these people would be worth over £ 2,500 .
so we are making £ 5 for every £ 1 that we spend . "
and despite the high costs , shelter and other charities say it can work out cheaper than many other methods of fundraising .

quality donors peter gilheaney from the giving campaign - the organisation that promotes charitable giving - told the programme it is the kind of people street collection attracts that is also valuable : " they bring in 16-35 year-olds who are really like gold-dust for charities because they will give over a longer lifetime .
" charities are having to compete to get their name known , and street fundraising - the chance to actually talk to somebody one-to-one - is a great way for them to do so . "

it charges a flat hourly fee for sending a team of agents onto the street , but chief executive simon rydings , would not say what that was .
" it would be impossible ... to say exactly what proportion of the costs go into recruiting someone .
that would require an on-site mathematician . "
but he agreed that it can cost up to 90 % of the first year takings .
however , town centre managers have told money box that street collecting has become the biggest cause of complaints from the public and are lobbying for extra powers on the issue .
one charity - médecins sans frontières - told the programme it is pulling out of street collecting because it has not proved effective , and it thinks there are now too many charities raising money this way .

scope , and the mental health charity rethink , admitted it can be as little as 10 % .
most charities refused to talk to money box about the issue , but shelter fundraising director alan gosschalk told the programme he knows face-to-face fundraising can be unpopular , but says it is a valuable way of getting support : charities are having to compete to get their name known and street fundraising , is a great way for them to do so peter gilheaney , giving campaign " on average people that support us with a direct debit would do so for five years or more .
" that helps us to plan ahead and gives us stability in our income . "
and he continued : " if we were for example to recruit 10 new supporters today , we may be paying an agency something like £ 500 in costs .
" what we know is , on average , over the lifetime of their support , these people would be worth over £ 2,500 .
so we are making £ 5 for every £ 1 that we spend . "
and despite the high costs , shelter and other charities say it can work out cheaper than many other methods of fundraising .
and it is not just about saving money .
quality donors peter gilheaney from the giving campaign - the organisation that promotes charitable giving - told the programme it is the kind of people street collection attracts that is also valuable : " they bring in 16-35 year-olds who are really like gold-dust for charities because they will give over a longer lifetime .
" charities are having to compete to get their name known , and street fundraising - the chance to actually talk to somebody one-to-one - is a great way for them to do so . "
money box asked to speak to the five biggest commercial fundraising companies in britain .
but the only one that agreed was push in london 's shoreditch .
its clients include the nspcc and the terence higgins trust .
it charges a flat hourly fee for sending a team of agents onto the street , but chief executive simon rydings , would not say what that was .
" it would be impossible ... to say exactly what proportion of the costs go into recruiting someone .
that would require an on-site mathematician . "
but he agreed that it can cost up to 90 % of the first year takings .
however , town centre managers have told money box that street collecting has become the biggest cause of complaints from the public and are lobbying for extra powers on the issue .
one charity - médecins sans frontières - told the programme it is pulling out of street collecting because it has not proved effective , and it thinks there are now too many charities raising money this way .
bbc radio 4 's money box was broadcast on saturday , 18 october , 2003 at 1204 bst .

the letter was read out by a congress secretary at an emergency session of the legislature broadcast live on bolivian atb red nacional de television .
honourable congressmen : bolivia is facing a critical time .
democracy is under siege by corporate , political and union groups that do not believe in it and use it in any way they please .
all this has manifested itself in a scenario of sedition that on the pretext of natural gas exports has violated the essence of democracy - respect for the outcome of elections held to choose rulers .
while talks were rejected , that issue has been used to make me resign .
we know that democracy is a privilege we must preserve in order to keep the bolivian nation united i have been blamed not only for the current problems the republic is facing , but also for the lack of solutions .
if that were the issue , my resignation , which i am placing at the consideration of the honourable national congress , should be enough to solve the nation 's problems .
but even though i want this fervently , i am afraid that the solution will not be that easy .
the deep roots of this crisis oblige one to make an essential analysis that the passions currently unleashed do not allow .
time will do this for us , and i commend myself to it in order to find the serene and objective balance that circumstances currently prevent us from achieving .
for us bolivians , it has cost a great deal to attain and keep democracy .
this is an unfortunate precedent for democracy in bolivia and the continent today we know that democracy is a privilege we must preserve in order to keep the bolivian nation united .
with freedom and dignity , the president of the republic is the symbol of this unity amid national diversity , a diversity that must be a source of pride , not of conflict and violence .
as i submit my resignation for the consideration of the honourable national congress , i do so with the profound conviction that its acceptance is no longer consistent with the norm that a democratically elected president can not be removed through outlawed mechanisms of pressure and violence .
this is an unfortunate precedent for democracy in bolivia and the continent .
according to article 68 , paragraph 4 , of the political constitution , congress must decide whether to accept or reject it .
it is my duty to warn you that the dangers looming over the fatherland remain intact - national disintegration , authoritarianism by corporations and unions , and fratricidal violence if it accepts , the vice president of the republic should take over the presidency and perform its duties until the end of the constitutional term , in accordance with article 93 , paragraph 2 of the constitution .
this is a task that congress must tackle with the responsibility demanded by these times .
it is my duty , however , to warn you that the dangers looming over the fatherland remain intact - national disintegration , authoritarianism by corporations and unions , and fratricidal violence .
these dangers stem from historical circumstances and the fact that the essence of democracy has been questioned .
i hope to god that we will not be made to regret all this one day .
honourable congressmen : i have served bolivia with unlimited devotion and dedication .
this is the best reward i could have earned in my life .
i thank god for this privilege , and i ask him , from the bottom of my heart , to enlighten and bless all bolivians .

ruthin in denbighshire , north wales , was one of the worst-affected towns in wales during the disastrous autumn floods of 2000 .
but the area 's local authority is now confident it can prevent such devastating problems happening again - thanks to almost £ 3m-worth of flood prevention work .
among the most severely-hit parts were mwrog street and the borthyn area of the town .
since 1998 , there have several incidents of flooding resulting from problems with a culvert , which runs from mwrog street to the river clwyd .
residents had to be evacuated three years ago when a culvert beneath the ground was unable to cope with continuous flood water .
floods have taken property and treasured possessions denbighshire county council has since developed a scheme to divert excess water from the river clwyd away from the town centre .
a brook which runs under the street and along farmland to denbigh road will be re-directed to join the river clwyd .
contractual problems with the owners of the farmland which will now carry diverted river water have meant the cost of the scheme has doubled this year from £ 1.6m to just under £ 3m .

ruthin in denbighshire , north wales , was one of the worst-affected towns in wales during the disastrous autumn floods of 2000 .
but the area 's local authority is now confident it can prevent such devastating problems happening again - thanks to almost £ 3m-worth of flood prevention work .
among the most severely-hit parts were mwrog street and the borthyn area of the town .
since 1998 , there have several incidents of flooding resulting from problems with a culvert , which runs from mwrog street to the river clwyd .
residents had to be evacuated three years ago when a culvert beneath the ground was unable to cope with continuous flood water .
floods have taken property and treasured possessions denbighshire county council has since developed a scheme to divert excess water from the river clwyd away from the town centre .
a brook which runs under the street and along farmland to denbigh road will be re-directed to join the river clwyd .
contractual problems with the owners of the farmland which will now carry diverted river water have meant the cost of the scheme has doubled this year from £ 1.6m to just under £ 3m .
the council pressed ahead with the work , having made a pledge to people living in the town .
many families had seen their homes flooded four times in four years the authority is confident future floods can be averted but many locals will only be convinced once the new system has been tested by the weather .

bbc news online 's latin america analyst robert plummer explains what has caused the crisis .
why is gas so important to bolivia ?
bolivia is one of the poorest countries in the americas but has latin america 's second-biggest reserves of natural gas .
exporting the gas to the us and mexico as president sanchez de lozada 's government planned could make the difference between boom and bust .
economists say that since bolivia has an annual trade deficit of between $ 300m and $ 500m , the gas export plan is the only way the country can balance its books .
the plan also has the backing of the international monetary fund which believes it could increase bolivia 's growth rate by a whole percentage point over the next five years .
so why the protests ?
mainly because macro-economic arguments like these cut no ice with bolivia 's impoverished indigenous indian majority , who feel that the economy is run for the benefit of a wealthy elite .
bolivia has been a democracy since 1982 after decades of political instability and repeated military coups .
but during that time , inequalities of wealth have increased and there has been no reduction in poverty .
as a result , ingrained latin american hostility to giving up control over natural resources has now combined with the bolivian masses ' wider sense of economic exclusion to produce a socially explosive mixture .
nationalism also plays a key role .
the idea of selling off bolivia 's gas to the us was always certain to anger the president 's left-wing opponents , fearful of being exploited by the " gringos " to the north .
bolivian pride was further dented by the idea of exporting the gas by way of a chilean port - an outlet that was in fact part of bolivian territory until chile seized bolivia 's coastline in their 1879-83 war .
what have the protesters been demanding ?
as far as bolivia 's gas reserves are concerned , the protesters are calling for them to be nationalised and made available exclusively to the bolivian people .
they are unconvinced by economists who say that it would take no more than 1 % of bolivia 's reserves to satisfy the country 's entire market in gas .
other demands include higher wages , better pensions , comprehensive land reform and bolivia 's withdrawal from the planned free trade area of the americas .
among the most militant of the protesters are coca-growing peasants in the central chapare region , who have been radicalised by us-backed attempts to eradicate their crop as part of washington 's " war on drugs " .
why did the president resign ?
president sanchez de lozada was arguably slow to respond to the sheer ferocity of the protests , making concessions only after it emerged that dozens of people had been killed .
the us-educated president , who spent most of his early years in exile , was ill-suited to the task of reaching out to his political opponents .
they became determined to push their campaign for indigenous rights all the way to the presidential palace .
goni , as the president is nicknamed , won the august 2002 election with just 22.5 % of the vote , and remained deeply unpopular .

bbc news online 's latin america analyst robert plummer explains what has caused the crisis .
why is gas so important to bolivia ?
bolivia is one of the poorest countries in the americas but has latin america 's second-biggest reserves of natural gas .
exporting the gas to the us and mexico as president sanchez de lozada 's government planned could make the difference between boom and bust .
economists say that since bolivia has an annual trade deficit of between $ 300m and $ 500m , the gas export plan is the only way the country can balance its books .
the plan also has the backing of the international monetary fund which believes it could increase bolivia 's growth rate by a whole percentage point over the next five years .
so why the protests ?
mainly because macro-economic arguments like these cut no ice with bolivia 's impoverished indigenous indian majority , who feel that the economy is run for the benefit of a wealthy elite .
bolivia has been a democracy since 1982 after decades of political instability and repeated military coups .
but during that time , inequalities of wealth have increased and there has been no reduction in poverty .
as a result , ingrained latin american hostility to giving up control over natural resources has now combined with the bolivian masses ' wider sense of economic exclusion to produce a socially explosive mixture .
nationalism also plays a key role .
the idea of selling off bolivia 's gas to the us was always certain to anger the president 's left-wing opponents , fearful of being exploited by the " gringos " to the north .
bolivian pride was further dented by the idea of exporting the gas by way of a chilean port - an outlet that was in fact part of bolivian territory until chile seized bolivia 's coastline in their 1879-83 war .
what have the protesters been demanding ?
as far as bolivia 's gas reserves are concerned , the protesters are calling for them to be nationalised and made available exclusively to the bolivian people .
they are unconvinced by economists who say that it would take no more than 1 % of bolivia 's reserves to satisfy the country 's entire market in gas .
other demands include higher wages , better pensions , comprehensive land reform and bolivia 's withdrawal from the planned free trade area of the americas .
among the most militant of the protesters are coca-growing peasants in the central chapare region , who have been radicalised by us-backed attempts to eradicate their crop as part of washington 's " war on drugs " .
why did the president resign ?
president sanchez de lozada was arguably slow to respond to the sheer ferocity of the protests , making concessions only after it emerged that dozens of people had been killed .
the us-educated president , who spent most of his early years in exile , was ill-suited to the task of reaching out to his political opponents .
they became determined to push their campaign for indigenous rights all the way to the presidential palace .
goni , as the president is nicknamed , won the august 2002 election with just 22.5 % of the vote , and remained deeply unpopular .

then he paused , as if thinking about what he was going to say next .
congolese teenager pans for gold , but the war has affected the trade " folks , as we are missionaries , we always start our flights with a prayer , " he said .
then he began to pray .
he asked that we be safe on our journey .
he asked , too , that his passengers might find the story they were looking for in congo .
by now danny would have known exactly the kind of story we would find .
he had grown up in africa .
it was his home .
every other day he flew into north-eastern congo .
he had helped evacuate hundreds of people when the fighting erupted around bunia in late spring and summer .
danny knew congo alright but he wore his faith like armour , and from his world above the clouds this missionary pilot saw a different africa .
peaceful from up there , one could see the well tilled fields of uganda , the silver immensity of lake victoria , the occasional fishing boats speckled on its surface , and then the land sloping upwards into mountains and forest and another expanse of water , lake albert .
an invisible line divides the lake and at half past three on a sunny afternoon we crossed into congo .
as i said , from the vantage point of these skies , one saw a different africa .
it was a green place , a peaceful place .
we passed over small brush fires , the thick white smoke curling into the sky and then dissipating as it hit the cold air further up .
from here congo was at peace .
then we began to descend .
we crossed a line of hills and banked to the left , then circled and flew over a large town .
this was bunia - our destination , its streets busy in the sunlight .
coming in to land we could see the tents of the un troops , their white armoured vehicles , the barbed wire encircling the airport perimeter .
blue helmets , white vehicles , the green hills of central africa .
echoes of rwanda children have been the target of militias for one jolting moment i was carried back to another place , a central african nation where i had watched the un fail to halt genocide .
rwanda .
over the next few days the echoes of that other tragedy would follow wherever we went .
the un compound in bunia is encircled by razor wire and guarded by uruguayan troops .
they looked tired , dusty and uncomfortable .
there were bangladeshis too , and pakistanis and there are nepalese on the way .
the armies of the world 's poorest countries , just as was the case in rwanda .
for , here at the outset , let us be clear about one matter : that congo is a tragedy the developed world has done its best to ignore .
a congolese soldier in a war-torn country four million people have died from massacre , famine , disease .
four million in just five years .
in that period the armies of no fewer than seven african countries have fought here .
they did not fight for the good of the congolese but as part of a latter day scramble for africa , a war for the country 's rich resources of diamonds , gold and minerals .
in recent years we 've recoiled at fresh accounts of the horrors inflicted on congo under the colonial rule of the belgian king leopold .
heroes yet even as a powerful new account of his terrible reign was being published , a new age of evil was overtaking congo .
that night in the lushakavini hotel i pulled out a copy of the latest report on congo by human rights watch .
its chief researcher is a remarkable woman called alison des forges .
i remember during the rwandan genocide , meeting a group of survivors and one of them pressing into my hand a letter for alison .
" she is my friend , and she must be told what has happened to us , " the woman said .
he saw the corpses of his family , including his nephew who was five-years-old , with his stomach cut open .
they were cutting the flesh and eating the victims witness to a massacre alison des forges and the brave congolese activists who help her are heroes of our time .
they are brave because recording the testimonies of the traumatised survivors of congo 's horror is in itself traumatising work .
they are brave because it can also be dangerous work : human rights activists have been abducted , tortured and murdered .
it is only when you hear the testimony that they record , that you understand why they are so driven to bear witness .
for example , this story recorded from a pygmy man , in late 2002 .
" about 20 miles from mambasa , the militia attacked a pygmy camp . "
" a man called amuzati who was hunting in the forest heard shooting .
as he was n't far from his camp he returned to see what was happening . "
" about half a mile away from the camp he heard shouts and crying , and then there was silence . "
" he came closer and saw several militia men . "
congolese are weary of the war , but there is no hope in sight " he saw the corpses of his family , including his nephew who was five-years-old , with his stomach cut open . "
" they were cutting the flesh and eating the victims ... he was filled with emotion and afraid that if he shouted , they would catch him too , so he crept away . "
or there was the story told by the aunt of a rape victim - there is an epidemic of sexual violence in north-eastern congo .
this is the story she told : " one day in early november we were on the road near mambasa when we ran into the militia . "
" some had camouflage uniforms and others just had green ones ; some of them had green berets . "
" they took our things from us including our bicycle and goats and then they took our niece who was only 15-years-old and they raped her in front of us . "
even children are sent off to fight " then they took her away with them .
we have not seen her since . "
" her name was marie anzoyo .
i know other girls who were taken including a girl called therese and another called vero . "
marie anzoyo , therese , vero .
three names out of millions .
we rose before dawn on the second day and set out on the road north .
i use the word " road " , but it hardly describes the dirt track which leads , over five bone-crunching hours to the village of kachele , scene of congo 's latest massacre .
the landrover slid in the mud , bounced over ruts .
in places the bush was so thick it brushed the windows of the car .
ethnic wars this was perfect ambush country , a landscape of concealment and hidden watchers .
in this part of congo , alone 50,000 people have been killed in the past five years .
the country is full of refugee camps like this with people living in fear many of them members of two warring ethnic groups : the hema and the lendu .
close to kachele we saw a log lying across the track leading into the hills .
our guide , dego , told us it had been placed there by lendu tribesmen , those accused of carrying out the slaughter of hema people at kachele .
" they are just over that hill , " he said .
not for the first time in central africa , i was reminded of wb yeats ' line : little room / great hatred .
survival here , desperately poor people fought each other for the sake of land .
this is not mindless tribal violence .
in this part of the world land means food and that means survival .
if these people lived in a country with a functioning state , these disputes over land would likely never have erupted into such appalling violence .
un peacekeepers approach a congo village congo 's vast natural wealth should provide prosperity for all of its people .
but instead , they have been cursed to live in a land ruled first by a venal belgian king , and by mobutu sese seko , the world 's most corrupt dictator , and now a country where foreign armies like uganda and rwanda have come to plunder and fight .
in kachele the survivors sat around in their rags .
some looked bewildered .
an old woman crouched outside the hut in which her family had been murdered .
a cluster of children sat together in the open space between the mud and thatch huts .
too late here are the facts of the massacre at kachele .
shortly after 0500 , as the light crept over the valley , a party of lendu militiamen approached the village .
one of them fired shots .
it was the signal for the killing to begin .
families panicked by the shooting ran out of their huts .
they ran into the militia and were cut down , mostly with the weapons used by africa 's poor : machetes , clubs and spears .
sixty-five people were killed .
forty of them were children .
forty children hacked and bludgeoned at the hands of adults .
the killers escaped as they nearly always do , and a few hours after that the un peacekeepers arrived .
too late to do anything but count the corpses .
kachele 's chief is bitter .
antoine dhabi is 37-years-old .
he inherited the chieftaincy from his brother who was murdered by the lendu .
he told me that his daughters - eight-year-old esperance and 13-year-old antoinette - had been abducted by the attackers .
antoine dhabi said he felt like giving up and leaving for the town .
the land of his ancestors had become too dangerous .
" the lendu want to wipe us all out , " he said .
but talk to lendu people who have been attacked by the hema militias and you will hear the same thing .
they too have suffered appalling massacres .
howl of grief as we were leaving the village we heard singing .
i got out of the landrover and walked in the direction of the voice .
i say singing , but it is hardly an accurate description it was partly song , but also , partly , a howl of grief .
an old woman was performing a ritual of mourning - dancing on the mass graves which contained the bodies of the dead .
her name was marianne and she had just come back to the village to find that her son and several of his children were dead .
i asked our guide dego what she was singing .
" she sings that her children are gone , that they are decaying in the earth , " he said .
then the old woman climbed down from the grave and got down on her knees , and then threw her arms across the mound of earth .
and in this way , she said farewell to her children .

for , here at the outset , let us be clear about one matter : that congo is a tragedy the developed world has done its best to ignore .
a congolese soldier in a war-torn country four million people have died from massacre , famine , disease .
four million in just five years .
in that period the armies of no fewer than seven african countries have fought here .
they did not fight for the good of the congolese but as part of a latter day scramble for africa , a war for the country 's rich resources of diamonds , gold and minerals .
in recent years we 've recoiled at fresh accounts of the horrors inflicted on congo under the colonial rule of the belgian king leopold .
heroes yet even as a powerful new account of his terrible reign was being published , a new age of evil was overtaking congo .
that night in the lushakavini hotel i pulled out a copy of the latest report on congo by human rights watch .
its chief researcher is a remarkable woman called alison des forges .
i remember during the rwandan genocide , meeting a group of survivors and one of them pressing into my hand a letter for alison .
" she is my friend , and she must be told what has happened to us , " the woman said .
he saw the corpses of his family , including his nephew who was five-years-old , with his stomach cut open .
they were cutting the flesh and eating the victims witness to a massacre alison des forges and the brave congolese activists who help her are heroes of our time .
they are brave because recording the testimonies of the traumatised survivors of congo 's horror is in itself traumatising work .
they are brave because it can also be dangerous work : human rights activists have been abducted , tortured and murdered .
it is only when you hear the testimony that they record , that you understand why they are so driven to bear witness .
for example , this story recorded from a pygmy man , in late 2002 .
" about 20 miles from mambasa , the militia attacked a pygmy camp . "
" a man called amuzati who was hunting in the forest heard shooting .
as he was n't far from his camp he returned to see what was happening . "
" about half a mile away from the camp he heard shouts and crying , and then there was silence . "
" he came closer and saw several militia men . "
congolese are weary of the war , but there is no hope in sight " he saw the corpses of his family , including his nephew who was five-years-old , with his stomach cut open . "
" they were cutting the flesh and eating the victims ... he was filled with emotion and afraid that if he shouted , they would catch him too , so he crept away . "
or there was the story told by the aunt of a rape victim - there is an epidemic of sexual violence in north-eastern congo .
this is the story she told : " one day in early november we were on the road near mambasa when we ran into the militia . "
" some had camouflage uniforms and others just had green ones ; some of them had green berets . "
" they took our things from us including our bicycle and goats and then they took our niece who was only 15-years-old and they raped her in front of us . "
even children are sent off to fight " then they took her away with them .
we have not seen her since . "
" her name was marie anzoyo .
i know other girls who were taken including a girl called therese and another called vero . "
marie anzoyo , therese , vero .
three names out of millions .
we rose before dawn on the second day and set out on the road north .
i use the word " road " , but it hardly describes the dirt track which leads , over five bone-crunching hours to the village of kachele , scene of congo 's latest massacre .
the landrover slid in the mud , bounced over ruts .
in places the bush was so thick it brushed the windows of the car .
ethnic wars this was perfect ambush country , a landscape of concealment and hidden watchers .
in this part of congo , alone 50,000 people have been killed in the past five years .
the country is full of refugee camps like this with people living in fear many of them members of two warring ethnic groups : the hema and the lendu .
close to kachele we saw a log lying across the track leading into the hills .
our guide , dego , told us it had been placed there by lendu tribesmen , those accused of carrying out the slaughter of hema people at kachele .
" they are just over that hill , " he said .
not for the first time in central africa , i was reminded of wb yeats ' line : little room / great hatred .
survival here , desperately poor people fought each other for the sake of land .
this is not mindless tribal violence .
in this part of the world land means food and that means survival .
if these people lived in a country with a functioning state , these disputes over land would likely never have erupted into such appalling violence .
un peacekeepers approach a congo village congo 's vast natural wealth should provide prosperity for all of its people .
but instead , they have been cursed to live in a land ruled first by a venal belgian king , and by mobutu sese seko , the world 's most corrupt dictator , and now a country where foreign armies like uganda and rwanda have come to plunder and fight .
in kachele the survivors sat around in their rags .
some looked bewildered .
an old woman crouched outside the hut in which her family had been murdered .
a cluster of children sat together in the open space between the mud and thatch huts .
too late here are the facts of the massacre at kachele .
shortly after 0500 , as the light crept over the valley , a party of lendu militiamen approached the village .
one of them fired shots .
it was the signal for the killing to begin .
families panicked by the shooting ran out of their huts .
they ran into the militia and were cut down , mostly with the weapons used by africa 's poor : machetes , clubs and spears .
sixty-five people were killed .
forty of them were children .
forty children hacked and bludgeoned at the hands of adults .
the killers escaped as they nearly always do , and a few hours after that the un peacekeepers arrived .
too late to do anything but count the corpses .
kachele 's chief is bitter .
antoine dhabi is 37-years-old .
he inherited the chieftaincy from his brother who was murdered by the lendu .
he told me that his daughters - eight-year-old esperance and 13-year-old antoinette - had been abducted by the attackers .
antoine dhabi said he felt like giving up and leaving for the town .
the land of his ancestors had become too dangerous .
" the lendu want to wipe us all out , " he said .
but talk to lendu people who have been attacked by the hema militias and you will hear the same thing .
they too have suffered appalling massacres .
howl of grief as we were leaving the village we heard singing .
i got out of the landrover and walked in the direction of the voice .
i say singing , but it is hardly an accurate description it was partly song , but also , partly , a howl of grief .
an old woman was performing a ritual of mourning - dancing on the mass graves which contained the bodies of the dead .
her name was marianne and she had just come back to the village to find that her son and several of his children were dead .
i asked our guide dego what she was singing .
" she sings that her children are gone , that they are decaying in the earth , " he said .
then the old woman climbed down from the grave and got down on her knees , and then threw her arms across the mound of earth .
and in this way , she said farewell to her children .

then he began to pray .
he asked that we be safe on our journey .
he asked , too , that his passengers might find the story they were looking for in congo .
by now danny would have known exactly the kind of story we would find .
he had grown up in africa .
it was his home .
every other day he flew into north-eastern congo .
he had helped evacuate hundreds of people when the fighting erupted around bunia in late spring and summer .
danny knew congo alright but he wore his faith like armour , and from his world above the clouds this missionary pilot saw a different africa .
peaceful from up there , one could see the well tilled fields of uganda , the silver immensity of lake victoria , the occasional fishing boats speckled on its surface , and then the land sloping upwards into mountains and forest and another expanse of water , lake albert .
an invisible line divides the lake and at half past three on a sunny afternoon we crossed into congo .
as i said , from the vantage point of these skies , one saw a different africa .
it was a green place , a peaceful place .
we passed over small brush fires , the thick white smoke curling into the sky and then dissipating as it hit the cold air further up .
from here congo was at peace .
then we began to descend .
we crossed a line of hills and banked to the left , then circled and flew over a large town .
this was bunia - our destination , its streets busy in the sunlight .
coming in to land we could see the tents of the un troops , their white armoured vehicles , the barbed wire encircling the airport perimeter .
blue helmets , white vehicles , the green hills of central africa .
echoes of rwanda children have been the target of militias for one jolting moment i was carried back to another place , a central african nation where i had watched the un fail to halt genocide .
rwanda .

it was his home .
every other day he flew into north-eastern congo .
he had helped evacuate hundreds of people when the fighting erupted around bunia in late spring and summer .
danny knew congo alright but he wore his faith like armour , and from his world above the clouds this missionary pilot saw a different africa .
peaceful from up there , one could see the well tilled fields of uganda , the silver immensity of lake victoria , the occasional fishing boats speckled on its surface , and then the land sloping upwards into mountains and forest and another expanse of water , lake albert .
an invisible line divides the lake and at half past three on a sunny afternoon we crossed into congo .
as i said , from the vantage point of these skies , one saw a different africa .
it was a green place , a peaceful place .
we passed over small brush fires , the thick white smoke curling into the sky and then dissipating as it hit the cold air further up .
from here congo was at peace .
then we began to descend .
we crossed a line of hills and banked to the left , then circled and flew over a large town .
this was bunia - our destination , its streets busy in the sunlight .
coming in to land we could see the tents of the un troops , their white armoured vehicles , the barbed wire encircling the airport perimeter .
blue helmets , white vehicles , the green hills of central africa .
echoes of rwanda children have been the target of militias for one jolting moment i was carried back to another place , a central african nation where i had watched the un fail to halt genocide .
rwanda .
over the next few days the echoes of that other tragedy would follow wherever we went .
the un compound in bunia is encircled by razor wire and guarded by uruguayan troops .
they looked tired , dusty and uncomfortable .
there were bangladeshis too , and pakistanis and there are nepalese on the way .
the armies of the world 's poorest countries , just as was the case in rwanda .
for , here at the outset , let us be clear about one matter : that congo is a tragedy the developed world has done its best to ignore .
a congolese soldier in a war-torn country four million people have died from massacre , famine , disease .
four million in just five years .
in that period the armies of no fewer than seven african countries have fought here .
they did not fight for the good of the congolese but as part of a latter day scramble for africa , a war for the country 's rich resources of diamonds , gold and minerals .
in recent years we 've recoiled at fresh accounts of the horrors inflicted on congo under the colonial rule of the belgian king leopold .
heroes yet even as a powerful new account of his terrible reign was being published , a new age of evil was overtaking congo .
that night in the lushakavini hotel i pulled out a copy of the latest report on congo by human rights watch .
its chief researcher is a remarkable woman called alison des forges .
i remember during the rwandan genocide , meeting a group of survivors and one of them pressing into my hand a letter for alison .
" she is my friend , and she must be told what has happened to us , " the woman said .
he saw the corpses of his family , including his nephew who was five-years-old , with his stomach cut open .
they were cutting the flesh and eating the victims witness to a massacre alison des forges and the brave congolese activists who help her are heroes of our time .
they are brave because recording the testimonies of the traumatised survivors of congo 's horror is in itself traumatising work .
they are brave because it can also be dangerous work : human rights activists have been abducted , tortured and murdered .
it is only when you hear the testimony that they record , that you understand why they are so driven to bear witness .
for example , this story recorded from a pygmy man , in late 2002 .
" about 20 miles from mambasa , the militia attacked a pygmy camp . "
" a man called amuzati who was hunting in the forest heard shooting .
as he was n't far from his camp he returned to see what was happening . "
" about half a mile away from the camp he heard shouts and crying , and then there was silence . "
" he came closer and saw several militia men . "
congolese are weary of the war , but there is no hope in sight " he saw the corpses of his family , including his nephew who was five-years-old , with his stomach cut open . "
" they were cutting the flesh and eating the victims ... he was filled with emotion and afraid that if he shouted , they would catch him too , so he crept away . "
or there was the story told by the aunt of a rape victim - there is an epidemic of sexual violence in north-eastern congo .
this is the story she told : " one day in early november we were on the road near mambasa when we ran into the militia . "
" some had camouflage uniforms and others just had green ones ; some of them had green berets . "
" they took our things from us including our bicycle and goats and then they took our niece who was only 15-years-old and they raped her in front of us . "
even children are sent off to fight " then they took her away with them .
we have not seen her since . "
" her name was marie anzoyo .
i know other girls who were taken including a girl called therese and another called vero . "
marie anzoyo , therese , vero .
three names out of millions .
we rose before dawn on the second day and set out on the road north .
i use the word " road " , but it hardly describes the dirt track which leads , over five bone-crunching hours to the village of kachele , scene of congo 's latest massacre .
the landrover slid in the mud , bounced over ruts .
in places the bush was so thick it brushed the windows of the car .
ethnic wars this was perfect ambush country , a landscape of concealment and hidden watchers .
in this part of congo , alone 50,000 people have been killed in the past five years .
the country is full of refugee camps like this with people living in fear many of them members of two warring ethnic groups : the hema and the lendu .
close to kachele we saw a log lying across the track leading into the hills .
our guide , dego , told us it had been placed there by lendu tribesmen , those accused of carrying out the slaughter of hema people at kachele .
" they are just over that hill , " he said .
not for the first time in central africa , i was reminded of wb yeats ' line : little room / great hatred .
survival here , desperately poor people fought each other for the sake of land .
this is not mindless tribal violence .
in this part of the world land means food and that means survival .
if these people lived in a country with a functioning state , these disputes over land would likely never have erupted into such appalling violence .
un peacekeepers approach a congo village congo 's vast natural wealth should provide prosperity for all of its people .
but instead , they have been cursed to live in a land ruled first by a venal belgian king , and by mobutu sese seko , the world 's most corrupt dictator , and now a country where foreign armies like uganda and rwanda have come to plunder and fight .
in kachele the survivors sat around in their rags .
some looked bewildered .
an old woman crouched outside the hut in which her family had been murdered .
a cluster of children sat together in the open space between the mud and thatch huts .
too late here are the facts of the massacre at kachele .
shortly after 0500 , as the light crept over the valley , a party of lendu militiamen approached the village .
one of them fired shots .
it was the signal for the killing to begin .
families panicked by the shooting ran out of their huts .
they ran into the militia and were cut down , mostly with the weapons used by africa 's poor : machetes , clubs and spears .
sixty-five people were killed .
forty of them were children .
forty children hacked and bludgeoned at the hands of adults .
the killers escaped as they nearly always do , and a few hours after that the un peacekeepers arrived .
too late to do anything but count the corpses .
kachele 's chief is bitter .
antoine dhabi is 37-years-old .
he inherited the chieftaincy from his brother who was murdered by the lendu .
he told me that his daughters - eight-year-old esperance and 13-year-old antoinette - had been abducted by the attackers .
antoine dhabi said he felt like giving up and leaving for the town .
the land of his ancestors had become too dangerous .
" the lendu want to wipe us all out , " he said .
but talk to lendu people who have been attacked by the hema militias and you will hear the same thing .
they too have suffered appalling massacres .
howl of grief as we were leaving the village we heard singing .
i got out of the landrover and walked in the direction of the voice .
i say singing , but it is hardly an accurate description it was partly song , but also , partly , a howl of grief .
an old woman was performing a ritual of mourning - dancing on the mass graves which contained the bodies of the dead .
her name was marianne and she had just come back to the village to find that her son and several of his children were dead .
i asked our guide dego what she was singing .
" she sings that her children are gone , that they are decaying in the earth , " he said .
then the old woman climbed down from the grave and got down on her knees , and then threw her arms across the mound of earth .
and in this way , she said farewell to her children .

almost all assaults on a weekend are alcohol-related while many of those partying may wake up with no more than a sore head and an empty wallet , for others the consequences will be far more serious .
at the royal sussex county hospital in brighton , a & e staff say by sunday morning the observation ward will be packed with the victims of assault , overdoses and injury - almost all of them alcohol related .

" almost every assault is alcohol related , especially during the weekend .

" to put it crudely , in men it fuels fights and in women it fuels overdoses after a row . "

" in the morning they will wake up , have a good breakfast , see a counsellor and agree not to drink so much , " she said .
the arrivals tend to come in waves , with people admitted after the pubs shut , then again when the clubs kick out at 2am , with a final influx at about 4am when the last venues close .

dr ransom said : " on thursday , friday , saturday nights we could get by with a quarter of the staff on the evening shifts if it was n't for alcohol . "

by sunday , these beds will be full of patients who have drunk too much " it can be as bad on a wednesday night as a saturday night , " she added .
" the staff have to suffer quite a lot of abusive behaviour . "
a report last month put the cost of britain 's binge-drinking culture to the nhs in the region of £ 1.7bn - with 1.2 million incidents of alcohol-related violence a year .
dr ransom , who has worked in a & e for seven years , would like to see breweries paying for some of the high cost of caring for the casualties .
' huge problem ' " alcohol is a huge problem and we get so used to dealing with it and having to deal with the effects of it both acutely and chronically , " he said .

" i think the people who should pay for it are the breweries , not the government or social services .
" i 'm not against drinking but we need adequate resources to patch up when it all goes wrong so frequently . "
road accidents the next morning are another regular result of heavy drinking , dr ransom adds , having spent an afternoon patching up the casualties of a crash which left their car a crumpled heap of metal .
" these young lads from this morning , still drunk from the night before , managed to walk out with minor scratches but could have been in the morgue , " he said .
