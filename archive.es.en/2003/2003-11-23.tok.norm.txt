death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . " on the wall right next to the entrance of " nepomuk house " hangs a tree cut out of paper .
more than 150 leaves have been stapled to the trunk and its branches .
each of them contains a name and a date .
it 's the date on which a person has died at this cologne hospice .
doctors ca n't help those who come here , said miriam ahrens , who heads " nepomuk house " .
" but people do n't necessarily come here to die , " she said .
" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '
psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .
but time is the most valuable thing the people at " nepomuk house " can give : time to spend with the dying and their relatives .
those who deal with death , ahrens has learned from experience , can let go and overcome their fear more easily .
hospices still uncommon in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly germans still spend their last days in regular hospitals .
few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospices help relatives to move on once their loved ones have died .
facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .
" it 's such a poignant event in your life and we consciously savored this dying and this illness , " zimmermann said .

volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "

facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .
" it 's such a poignant event in your life and we consciously savored this dying and this illness , " zimmermann said .
" we experienced it and suffered through it and that 's why it 's now a part of my life and has helped me to move on . " silke ballweg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the state museum covers the rhineland ’ s 40,000-year history , bringing together artifacts from the area ’ s period of roman occupation all the way up to recent works from local artists .
" i would venture to say that this museum is going to become a pilgrimage site in germany , " said udo molsberger , director of the regional authority that governs the museum .
germany 's first ' theme museum ' the museum has been reconceived as a " theme museum " according to director frank zehnde – a first for germany .
rather than organizing the exhibits in a chronological manner , zehnde and his curators have put their collection together into nine themed areas including " the rhineland and the world " and " power and the powerful . "
the themes are intended to provide a comprehensive view of life in the rhine region .
at the core of the museum ’ s collection are the remains of the neanderthal man , which serve as a symbol for the beginnings of the rhine region ’ s cultural history some 40,000 years ago .

a long journey to completion the reopening comes after numerous delays and budget overruns that led to a doubling of the facility 's planned costs .
construction first began in 1998 , but soon after planners realized it would be impossible to complete the structure within their budget .
" there were too many surprises , " molsberger told the news agency dpa .

death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . " on the wall right next to the entrance of " nepomuk house " hangs a tree cut out of paper .
more than 150 leaves have been stapled to the trunk and its branches .
each of them contains a name and a date .
it 's the date on which a person has died at this cologne hospice .
doctors ca n't help those who come here , said miriam ahrens , who heads " nepomuk house " .
" but people do n't necessarily come here to die , " she said .
" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '
psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .
but time is the most valuable thing the people at " nepomuk house " can give : time to spend with the dying and their relatives .
those who deal with death , ahrens has learned from experience , can let go and overcome their fear more easily .
hospices still uncommon in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly germans still spend their last days in regular hospitals .
few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospices help relatives to move on once their loved ones have died .
facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .
" it 's such a poignant event in your life and we consciously savored this dying and this illness , " zimmermann said .

death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . " on the wall right next to the entrance of " nepomuk house " hangs a tree cut out of paper .
more than 150 leaves have been stapled to the trunk and its branches .
each of them contains a name and a date .
it 's the date on which a person has died at this cologne hospice .
doctors ca n't help those who come here , said miriam ahrens , who heads " nepomuk house " .
" but people do n't necessarily come here to die , " she said .
" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '
psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .
but time is the most valuable thing the people at " nepomuk house " can give : time to spend with the dying and their relatives .
those who deal with death , ahrens has learned from experience , can let go and overcome their fear more easily .
hospices still uncommon in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly germans still spend their last days in regular hospitals .
few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospices help relatives to move on once their loved ones have died .
facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .
" it 's such a poignant event in your life and we consciously savored this dying and this illness , " zimmermann said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.11.2003 german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only dying leaves are considered beautiful .
death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . " on the wall right next to the entrance of " nepomuk house " hangs a tree cut out of paper .
more than 150 leaves have been stapled to the trunk and its branches .
each of them contains a name and a date .
it 's the date on which a person has died at this cologne hospice .
doctors ca n't help those who come here , said miriam ahrens , who heads " nepomuk house " .
" but people do n't necessarily come here to die , " she said .
" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .

psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .

few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .

" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .

death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . " on the wall right next to the entrance of " nepomuk house " hangs a tree cut out of paper .
more than 150 leaves have been stapled to the trunk and its branches .
each of them contains a name and a date .
it 's the date on which a person has died at this cologne hospice .
doctors ca n't help those who come here , said miriam ahrens , who heads " nepomuk house " .
" but people do n't necessarily come here to die , " she said .
" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '

of course , for a 40,000-year-old pile of bones , six years isn ’ t much time to wait – especially for a new museum with striking glass facades that would make any architect gush .
the state museum covers the rhineland ’ s 40,000-year history , bringing together artifacts from the area ’ s period of roman occupation all the way up to recent works from local artists .
" i would venture to say that this museum is going to become a pilgrimage site in germany , " said udo molsberger , director of the regional authority that governs the museum .
germany 's first ' theme museum ' the museum has been reconceived as a " theme museum " according to director frank zehnde – a first for germany .
rather than organizing the exhibits in a chronological manner , zehnde and his curators have put their collection together into nine themed areas including " the rhineland and the world " and " power and the powerful . "
the themes are intended to provide a comprehensive view of life in the rhine region .
at the core of the museum ’ s collection are the remains of the neanderthal man , which serve as a symbol for the beginnings of the rhine region ’ s cultural history some 40,000 years ago .
touch screen multimedia systems also allow visitors to engage with the exhibits .
one computer allows visitors to write on a wax tablet as roman soldiers did nearly 2,000 years ago .
" our museum isn ’ t a place where visitors get sucked in at one place and spit out at another , " said zehnder .
a long journey to completion the reopening comes after numerous delays and budget overruns that led to a doubling of the facility 's planned costs .
construction first began in 1998 , but soon after planners realized it would be impossible to complete the structure within their budget .
" there were too many surprises , " molsberger told the news agency dpa .
many were unpleasant , including mismanagement and the bankruptcy of firms involved in building the new museum .
but this weekend , that was all a distant memory .
" it was worth every euro , " molsberger told reporters .
the rheinisches landesmuseum is located at colmantstrasse 14-18 in bonn .
opening hours are 10 a.m.-6 p.m.
tuesdays through saturdays , with extended evening hours until 9 p.m. on wednesdays and fridays .

of course , for a 40,000-year-old pile of bones , six years isn ’ t much time to wait – especially for a new museum with striking glass facades that would make any architect gush .
the state museum covers the rhineland ’ s 40,000-year history , bringing together artifacts from the area ’ s period of roman occupation all the way up to recent works from local artists .
" i would venture to say that this museum is going to become a pilgrimage site in germany , " said udo molsberger , director of the regional authority that governs the museum .
germany 's first ' theme museum ' the museum has been reconceived as a " theme museum " according to director frank zehnde – a first for germany .

the themes are intended to provide a comprehensive view of life in the rhine region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.11.2003 german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only dying leaves are considered beautiful .
death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . " on the wall right next to the entrance of " nepomuk house " hangs a tree cut out of paper .
more than 150 leaves have been stapled to the trunk and its branches .
each of them contains a name and a date .
it 's the date on which a person has died at this cologne hospice .
doctors ca n't help those who come here , said miriam ahrens , who heads " nepomuk house " .
" but people do n't necessarily come here to die , " she said .
" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '
psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .
but time is the most valuable thing the people at " nepomuk house " can give : time to spend with the dying and their relatives .
those who deal with death , ahrens has learned from experience , can let go and overcome their fear more easily .
hospices still uncommon in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly germans still spend their last days in regular hospitals .
few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospices help relatives to move on once their loved ones have died .
facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .
" it 's such a poignant event in your life and we consciously savored this dying and this illness , " zimmermann said .

helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '
psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .
but time is the most valuable thing the people at " nepomuk house " can give : time to spend with the dying and their relatives .
those who deal with death , ahrens has learned from experience , can let go and overcome their fear more easily .
hospices still uncommon in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly germans still spend their last days in regular hospitals .
few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "

but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .

of course , for a 40,000-year-old pile of bones , six years isn ’ t much time to wait – especially for a new museum with striking glass facades that would make any architect gush .
the state museum covers the rhineland ’ s 40,000-year history , bringing together artifacts from the area ’ s period of roman occupation all the way up to recent works from local artists .
" i would venture to say that this museum is going to become a pilgrimage site in germany , " said udo molsberger , director of the regional authority that governs the museum .
germany 's first ' theme museum ' the museum has been reconceived as a " theme museum " according to director frank zehnde – a first for germany .
rather than organizing the exhibits in a chronological manner , zehnde and his curators have put their collection together into nine themed areas including " the rhineland and the world " and " power and the powerful . "
the themes are intended to provide a comprehensive view of life in the rhine region .
at the core of the museum ’ s collection are the remains of the neanderthal man , which serve as a symbol for the beginnings of the rhine region ’ s cultural history some 40,000 years ago .
touch screen multimedia systems also allow visitors to engage with the exhibits .
one computer allows visitors to write on a wax tablet as roman soldiers did nearly 2,000 years ago .
" our museum isn ’ t a place where visitors get sucked in at one place and spit out at another , " said zehnder .
a long journey to completion the reopening comes after numerous delays and budget overruns that led to a doubling of the facility 's planned costs .
construction first began in 1998 , but soon after planners realized it would be impossible to complete the structure within their budget .
" there were too many surprises , " molsberger told the news agency dpa .
many were unpleasant , including mismanagement and the bankruptcy of firms involved in building the new museum .
but this weekend , that was all a distant memory .
" it was worth every euro , " molsberger told reporters .
the rheinisches landesmuseum is located at colmantstrasse 14-18 in bonn .
opening hours are 10 a.m.-6 p.m.
tuesdays through saturdays , with extended evening hours until 9 p.m. on wednesdays and fridays .

of course , for a 40,000-year-old pile of bones , six years isn ’ t much time to wait – especially for a new museum with striking glass facades that would make any architect gush .
the state museum covers the rhineland ’ s 40,000-year history , bringing together artifacts from the area ’ s period of roman occupation all the way up to recent works from local artists .
" i would venture to say that this museum is going to become a pilgrimage site in germany , " said udo molsberger , director of the regional authority that governs the museum .
germany 's first ' theme museum ' the museum has been reconceived as a " theme museum " according to director frank zehnde – a first for germany .
rather than organizing the exhibits in a chronological manner , zehnde and his curators have put their collection together into nine themed areas including " the rhineland and the world " and " power and the powerful . "
the themes are intended to provide a comprehensive view of life in the rhine region .
at the core of the museum ’ s collection are the remains of the neanderthal man , which serve as a symbol for the beginnings of the rhine region ’ s cultural history some 40,000 years ago .
touch screen multimedia systems also allow visitors to engage with the exhibits .
one computer allows visitors to write on a wax tablet as roman soldiers did nearly 2,000 years ago .
" our museum isn ’ t a place where visitors get sucked in at one place and spit out at another , " said zehnder .
a long journey to completion the reopening comes after numerous delays and budget overruns that led to a doubling of the facility 's planned costs .
construction first began in 1998 , but soon after planners realized it would be impossible to complete the structure within their budget .
" there were too many surprises , " molsberger told the news agency dpa .
many were unpleasant , including mismanagement and the bankruptcy of firms involved in building the new museum .
but this weekend , that was all a distant memory .
" it was worth every euro , " molsberger told reporters .
the rheinisches landesmuseum is located at colmantstrasse 14-18 in bonn .
opening hours are 10 a.m.-6 p.m.

death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . " on the wall right next to the entrance of " nepomuk house " hangs a tree cut out of paper .
more than 150 leaves have been stapled to the trunk and its branches .
each of them contains a name and a date .
it 's the date on which a person has died at this cologne hospice .
doctors ca n't help those who come here , said miriam ahrens , who heads " nepomuk house " .
" but people do n't necessarily come here to die , " she said .
" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '
psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .
but time is the most valuable thing the people at " nepomuk house " can give : time to spend with the dying and their relatives .
those who deal with death , ahrens has learned from experience , can let go and overcome their fear more easily .
hospices still uncommon in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly germans still spend their last days in regular hospitals .
few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospices help relatives to move on once their loved ones have died .
facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .
" it 's such a poignant event in your life and we consciously savored this dying and this illness , " zimmermann said .

few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospices help relatives to move on once their loved ones have died .
facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .

death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . " on the wall right next to the entrance of " nepomuk house " hangs a tree cut out of paper .
more than 150 leaves have been stapled to the trunk and its branches .
each of them contains a name and a date .
it 's the date on which a person has died at this cologne hospice .
doctors ca n't help those who come here , said miriam ahrens , who heads " nepomuk house " .
" but people do n't necessarily come here to die , " she said .
" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '
psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .
but time is the most valuable thing the people at " nepomuk house " can give : time to spend with the dying and their relatives .

of course , for a 40,000-year-old pile of bones , six years isn ’ t much time to wait – especially for a new museum with striking glass facades that would make any architect gush .
the state museum covers the rhineland ’ s 40,000-year history , bringing together artifacts from the area ’ s period of roman occupation all the way up to recent works from local artists .
" i would venture to say that this museum is going to become a pilgrimage site in germany , " said udo molsberger , director of the regional authority that governs the museum .
germany 's first ' theme museum ' the museum has been reconceived as a " theme museum " according to director frank zehnde – a first for germany .
rather than organizing the exhibits in a chronological manner , zehnde and his curators have put their collection together into nine themed areas including " the rhineland and the world " and " power and the powerful . "
the themes are intended to provide a comprehensive view of life in the rhine region .
at the core of the museum ’ s collection are the remains of the neanderthal man , which serve as a symbol for the beginnings of the rhine region ’ s cultural history some 40,000 years ago .
touch screen multimedia systems also allow visitors to engage with the exhibits .
one computer allows visitors to write on a wax tablet as roman soldiers did nearly 2,000 years ago .
" our museum isn ’ t a place where visitors get sucked in at one place and spit out at another , " said zehnder .
a long journey to completion the reopening comes after numerous delays and budget overruns that led to a doubling of the facility 's planned costs .
construction first began in 1998 , but soon after planners realized it would be impossible to complete the structure within their budget .
" there were too many surprises , " molsberger told the news agency dpa .
many were unpleasant , including mismanagement and the bankruptcy of firms involved in building the new museum .
but this weekend , that was all a distant memory .
" it was worth every euro , " molsberger told reporters .
the rheinisches landesmuseum is located at colmantstrasse 14-18 in bonn .
opening hours are 10 a.m.-6 p.m.
tuesdays through saturdays , with extended evening hours until 9 p.m. on wednesdays and fridays .

" i would venture to say that this museum is going to become a pilgrimage site in germany , " said udo molsberger , director of the regional authority that governs the museum .
germany 's first ' theme museum ' the museum has been reconceived as a " theme museum " according to director frank zehnde – a first for germany .
rather than organizing the exhibits in a chronological manner , zehnde and his curators have put their collection together into nine themed areas including " the rhineland and the world " and " power and the powerful . "
the themes are intended to provide a comprehensive view of life in the rhine region .
at the core of the museum ’ s collection are the remains of the neanderthal man , which serve as a symbol for the beginnings of the rhine region ’ s cultural history some 40,000 years ago .

one computer allows visitors to write on a wax tablet as roman soldiers did nearly 2,000 years ago .
" our museum isn ’ t a place where visitors get sucked in at one place and spit out at another , " said zehnder .
a long journey to completion the reopening comes after numerous delays and budget overruns that led to a doubling of the facility 's planned costs .
construction first began in 1998 , but soon after planners realized it would be impossible to complete the structure within their budget .
" there were too many surprises , " molsberger told the news agency dpa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.11.2003 german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only dying leaves are considered beautiful .
death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . " on the wall right next to the entrance of " nepomuk house " hangs a tree cut out of paper .
more than 150 leaves have been stapled to the trunk and its branches .
each of them contains a name and a date .
it 's the date on which a person has died at this cologne hospice .
doctors ca n't help those who come here , said miriam ahrens , who heads " nepomuk house " .
" but people do n't necessarily come here to die , " she said .
" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '
psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .
but time is the most valuable thing the people at " nepomuk house " can give : time to spend with the dying and their relatives .
those who deal with death , ahrens has learned from experience , can let go and overcome their fear more easily .
hospices still uncommon in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly germans still spend their last days in regular hospitals .
few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospices help relatives to move on once their loved ones have died .
facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .
" it 's such a poignant event in your life and we consciously savored this dying and this illness , " zimmermann said .
" we experienced it and suffered through it and that 's why it 's now a part of my life and has helped me to move on .

of course , for a 40,000-year-old pile of bones , six years isn ’ t much time to wait – especially for a new museum with striking glass facades that would make any architect gush .
the state museum covers the rhineland ’ s 40,000-year history , bringing together artifacts from the area ’ s period of roman occupation all the way up to recent works from local artists .
" i would venture to say that this museum is going to become a pilgrimage site in germany , " said udo molsberger , director of the regional authority that governs the museum .
germany 's first ' theme museum ' the museum has been reconceived as a " theme museum " according to director frank zehnde – a first for germany .
rather than organizing the exhibits in a chronological manner , zehnde and his curators have put their collection together into nine themed areas including " the rhineland and the world " and " power and the powerful . "
the themes are intended to provide a comprehensive view of life in the rhine region .
at the core of the museum ’ s collection are the remains of the neanderthal man , which serve as a symbol for the beginnings of the rhine region ’ s cultural history some 40,000 years ago .

one computer allows visitors to write on a wax tablet as roman soldiers did nearly 2,000 years ago .
" our museum isn ’ t a place where visitors get sucked in at one place and spit out at another , " said zehnder .
a long journey to completion the reopening comes after numerous delays and budget overruns that led to a doubling of the facility 's planned costs .
construction first began in 1998 , but soon after planners realized it would be impossible to complete the structure within their budget .
" there were too many surprises , " molsberger told the news agency dpa .

death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . " on the wall right next to the entrance of " nepomuk house " hangs a tree cut out of paper .
more than 150 leaves have been stapled to the trunk and its branches .
each of them contains a name and a date .
it 's the date on which a person has died at this cologne hospice .
doctors ca n't help those who come here , said miriam ahrens , who heads " nepomuk house " .
" but people do n't necessarily come here to die , " she said .
" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '
psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .
but time is the most valuable thing the people at " nepomuk house " can give : time to spend with the dying and their relatives .
those who deal with death , ahrens has learned from experience , can let go and overcome their fear more easily .
hospices still uncommon in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly germans still spend their last days in regular hospitals .
few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "

facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .

" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '
psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .
but time is the most valuable thing the people at " nepomuk house " can give : time to spend with the dying and their relatives .
those who deal with death , ahrens has learned from experience , can let go and overcome their fear more easily .
hospices still uncommon in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly germans still spend their last days in regular hospitals .
few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospices help relatives to move on once their loved ones have died .
facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .
" it 's such a poignant event in your life and we consciously savored this dying and this illness , " zimmermann said .

of course , for a 40,000-year-old pile of bones , six years isn ’ t much time to wait – especially for a new museum with striking glass facades that would make any architect gush .
the state museum covers the rhineland ’ s 40,000-year history , bringing together artifacts from the area ’ s period of roman occupation all the way up to recent works from local artists .
" i would venture to say that this museum is going to become a pilgrimage site in germany , " said udo molsberger , director of the regional authority that governs the museum .
germany 's first ' theme museum ' the museum has been reconceived as a " theme museum " according to director frank zehnde – a first for germany .
rather than organizing the exhibits in a chronological manner , zehnde and his curators have put their collection together into nine themed areas including " the rhineland and the world " and " power and the powerful . "
the themes are intended to provide a comprehensive view of life in the rhine region .
at the core of the museum ’ s collection are the remains of the neanderthal man , which serve as a symbol for the beginnings of the rhine region ’ s cultural history some 40,000 years ago .
touch screen multimedia systems also allow visitors to engage with the exhibits .
one computer allows visitors to write on a wax tablet as roman soldiers did nearly 2,000 years ago .
" our museum isn ’ t a place where visitors get sucked in at one place and spit out at another , " said zehnder .
a long journey to completion the reopening comes after numerous delays and budget overruns that led to a doubling of the facility 's planned costs .
construction first began in 1998 , but soon after planners realized it would be impossible to complete the structure within their budget .
" there were too many surprises , " molsberger told the news agency dpa .
many were unpleasant , including mismanagement and the bankruptcy of firms involved in building the new museum .
but this weekend , that was all a distant memory .
" it was worth every euro , " molsberger told reporters .

" i would venture to say that this museum is going to become a pilgrimage site in germany , " said udo molsberger , director of the regional authority that governs the museum .
germany 's first ' theme museum ' the museum has been reconceived as a " theme museum " according to director frank zehnde – a first for germany .
rather than organizing the exhibits in a chronological manner , zehnde and his curators have put their collection together into nine themed areas including " the rhineland and the world " and " power and the powerful . "
the themes are intended to provide a comprehensive view of life in the rhine region .
at the core of the museum ’ s collection are the remains of the neanderthal man , which serve as a symbol for the beginnings of the rhine region ’ s cultural history some 40,000 years ago .
touch screen multimedia systems also allow visitors to engage with the exhibits .
one computer allows visitors to write on a wax tablet as roman soldiers did nearly 2,000 years ago .
" our museum isn ’ t a place where visitors get sucked in at one place and spit out at another , " said zehnder .
a long journey to completion the reopening comes after numerous delays and budget overruns that led to a doubling of the facility 's planned costs .
construction first began in 1998 , but soon after planners realized it would be impossible to complete the structure within their budget .
" there were too many surprises , " molsberger told the news agency dpa .
many were unpleasant , including mismanagement and the bankruptcy of firms involved in building the new museum .
but this weekend , that was all a distant memory .
" it was worth every euro , " molsberger told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.11.2003 german hospice movement seeks to make " dying a part of life " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only dying leaves are considered beautiful .
death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . " on the wall right next to the entrance of " nepomuk house " hangs a tree cut out of paper .
more than 150 leaves have been stapled to the trunk and its branches .
each of them contains a name and a date .
it 's the date on which a person has died at this cologne hospice .
doctors ca n't help those who come here , said miriam ahrens , who heads " nepomuk house " .
" but people do n't necessarily come here to die , " she said .
" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '
psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .
but time is the most valuable thing the people at " nepomuk house " can give : time to spend with the dying and their relatives .
those who deal with death , ahrens has learned from experience , can let go and overcome their fear more easily .
hospices still uncommon in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly germans still spend their last days in regular hospitals .
few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospices help relatives to move on once their loved ones have died .
facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .
" it 's such a poignant event in your life and we consciously savored this dying and this illness , " zimmermann said .
" we experienced it and suffered through it and that 's why it 's now a part of my life and has helped me to move on . " silke ballweg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

death remains a taboo topic , causing many to die alone - in hospitals or nursing homes .
since the late sixties , the german hospice movement has been trying to change this , showing people that " dying is a part of life . " on the wall right next to the entrance of " nepomuk house " hangs a tree cut out of paper .
more than 150 leaves have been stapled to the trunk and its branches .
each of them contains a name and a date .
it 's the date on which a person has died at this cologne hospice .
doctors ca n't help those who come here , said miriam ahrens , who heads " nepomuk house " .
" but people do n't necessarily come here to die , " she said .
" they come here if they 're in pain .
they want us to soothe the pain .
they do n't want to be alone when they die . "
helping people to deal with pain miriam ahrens therefore considers it her job to enable her patients to lead a dignified life up to the end .
as a result , a large part of hospice therapy focusses on pain relief : those in pain ca n't enjoy life any longer , said ahrens , who is fighting to keep joy in people 's lives .
" here , achievement has a completely different significance , " she said .
" for me , it 's an achievement if someone can walk down the hallway without pain or says , ' for the first time in a long time , i slept well again last night ' or ' i ate soup ' of ' i watched tv . " '
psychological problems are also something ahrens helps to deal with .
if unresolved conflicts prevent a patient from dying peacefully , she can try to come up with a solution .
but time is the most valuable thing the people at " nepomuk house " can give : time to spend with the dying and their relatives .
those who deal with death , ahrens has learned from experience , can let go and overcome their fear more easily .
hospices still uncommon in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly germans still spend their last days in regular hospitals .
few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospices help relatives to move on once their loved ones have died .
facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .
" it 's such a poignant event in your life and we consciously savored this dying and this illness , " zimmermann said .

hospices still uncommon in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many elderly germans still spend their last days in regular hospitals .
few germans experience the death of a loved one like this .
that 's why the global hospice movement is trying to encourage such a humane way of dealing with death .
in 1967 , the first hospice for the dying was founded in the united kingdom .
there , as well as in the u.s. , the hospice movement already has a much stronger base than in germany , where 200 in-patient hospices exist so far .
volunteers in about 1,000 groups nationwide are also helping relatives of the terminally ill to care for their loved ones in an out-patient setting .
looking after a dying person at home is a monumental task , said patricia bielstein , who has been working with the hospice movement for the past 15 years .
caretakers have to be on call 24 hours a day , hold back with their own needs and deal with the experience of death .
" our goal is to prevent the dying from getting pushed off to a hospital , " bielstein said .
" that 's why we try to support relatives and enable them to take time off to go to the doctor or the hairdresser or just relax for a while . "
companions in death hannelore zimmermann decided to become such a helper .
a couple of years ago , the 68-year-old signed up with the hospice movement to get trained as a " companion in death . "
she did n't realize that her husband would be the first person to need her .
when zimmermann 's husband was diagnosed with cancer three years ago , she knew that she wanted to take care of him at home .
in the beginning the couple hoped that he would recover , but at some point the doctor told them there was nothing else she could do .
seeing little angels " when the time came , he was still joking and said , ' i 'm seeing little angels already , ' because that 's exactly what he felt , " zimmermann said .
" friday night – i was lying next to him – he said , ' we 'll say good-bye now , i 'll die tonight . '
he did n't , but he fell into a coma and for me he was gone after that .
his soul was gone , only his body was still here .
and then he died on monday . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospices help relatives to move on once their loved ones have died .
facing death was painful and sad .
but hannelore zimmermann did n't regret that she took care of her husband at home .
on the contrary , she still lives on the experience .
" it 's such a poignant event in your life and we consciously savored this dying and this illness , " zimmermann said .
" we experienced it and suffered through it and that 's why it 's now a part of my life and has helped me to move on . " silke ballweg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

of course , for a 40,000-year-old pile of bones , six years isn ’ t much time to wait – especially for a new museum with striking glass facades that would make any architect gush .
the state museum covers the rhineland ’ s 40,000-year history , bringing together artifacts from the area ’ s period of roman occupation all the way up to recent works from local artists .
" i would venture to say that this museum is going to become a pilgrimage site in germany , " said udo molsberger , director of the regional authority that governs the museum .
germany 's first ' theme museum ' the museum has been reconceived as a " theme museum " according to director frank zehnde – a first for germany .
rather than organizing the exhibits in a chronological manner , zehnde and his curators have put their collection together into nine themed areas including " the rhineland and the world " and " power and the powerful . "
the themes are intended to provide a comprehensive view of life in the rhine region .

" our museum isn ’ t a place where visitors get sucked in at one place and spit out at another , " said zehnder .
a long journey to completion the reopening comes after numerous delays and budget overruns that led to a doubling of the facility 's planned costs .
construction first began in 1998 , but soon after planners realized it would be impossible to complete the structure within their budget .
" there were too many surprises , " molsberger told the news agency dpa .
many were unpleasant , including mismanagement and the bankruptcy of firms involved in building the new museum .

the proceeds of crime act aims to target the ill-gotten gains of the " untouchables " of the crime world .
since the law came into force in april , £ 1,548,461 has been recovered north of the border .
half the assets seized in scotland stay in the country to be spent on initiatives which aim to repair communities damaged by drug dealers .
the new legislation allows courts to seize assets they believe have been funded by crime , even if there is no conviction .
the new criminal confiscation unit -lrb- ccu -rrb- has gained 37 confiscation orders worth £ 1,203,482 in the last eight months .
in the same period last year there were 17 orders amounting to £ 338,000 .
the largest confiscation order was served on michael webster , who was jailed for 30 months in june on drugs charges .
more than £ 197,000 was seized from him the following month .
these increased seizures show the police and courts are using the new powers to hit them where it hurts jack mcconnell first minister a further £ 344,979 in assets has been forfeited under the new civil recovery procedure .
an another £ 3.2m of assets are currently frozen across scotland by the ccu through 61 restraint orders .
the uk treasury agreed last year that half of the cash seized north of the border could be retained by the scottish executive .
a spokesperson said this money would be allocated to improve communities which had been undermined by serious and organised crime .
first minister jack mcconnell said : " for too long , scotland 's communities have been sickened by the sight of drug dealers flaunting their ill-gotten gains .
" through their criminal networks , they have been able to carry on profiting from other people 's misery .
' excellent start ' " that is why we took action to put in place tougher laws to strip the assets from the ' untouchables ' , ending their lavish lifestyles and bankrupting their criminal enterprises .
" these increased seizures show the police and courts are using the new powers to hit them where it hurts . "
lord advocate colin boyd qc said prosecutors had made an " excellent " start in using the new powers .

the ftse 100 closed at 4,319 on friday , just 11 points up on the day , and down by 1.7 % from the beginning of the week .
the decline came mainly on thursday as investors digested news of simultaneous bomb attacks on the british consulate and on the offices of hsbc bank in istanbul .
however , analysts believe the sell-off could have been worse , and say the underlying economic picture remains encouraging .
" the market 's reaction was reasonably sanguine , " said hilary cook at barclays private clients .
" the earnings news is getting better , and there has been a big increase in mergers and acquisition activity , which shows companies are increasingly willing to spend their money . "
ms cook expects the market to register further modest gains in the weeks ahead .
dollar woes but the longer term outlook remains murky , with many analysts expecting higher interest rates and lower real incomes to curb consumer spending and economic growth .
there are also worries that the recent decline in the value of the dollar will cut into european export earnings , squeezing the eurozone economy just as it appears to be emerging from stagnation .
barring the second official estimate of third quarter economic growth , which is expected to show no change from the original 0.6 % figure , there are few significant uk figures due out next week .
investors will be looking instead to the us and europe for fresh leads , focusing on germany 's closely-watched ifo index of business confidence , out on tuesday , and , on wednesday , the latest figures for us durable goods orders .
on the corporate front , the main focus of interest will be full-year results from itv broadcasters and merger partners carlton and granada .
investors will be watching out for news on how the tie-up between the two companies , approved by competition watchdogs last month , is progressing .
city forecasters expect granada to post pre-tax profits of £ 153m , against £ 62.6m for carlton .
elsewhere , half-year results are expected from property investment firm british land , and specialty chemicals company johnson matthey .

asked whether she plans to marry , she replied : " i do n't know .
