a trade dispute is threatening to sour transatlantic relations , after the united states announced plans to sue the europe union unless it opens its market to millions of dollars of genetically modified goods . the united states said on tuesday it intends to file a complaint against the european union with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- over the eu ’ s five-year ban on importing new genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- . " the eu 's moratorium violates wto rules , " said u.s. trade representative robert zoellick at a press conference in washington .
he said that the eu 's blocking tactics prevented the development of the technology which could help farmers and consumers throughout the world .
the eu has authorized no new gmos for release since october 1998 . " we 've waited patiently for five years for the eu to follow the wto rules , " zoellick said .
" for five years , we 've been told by european officials that a change in policy is just around the corner .
but around every corner we find a new roadblock . " strained transatlantic ties the current dispute follows spats between the united states and the european union over uranium and corporate tax breaks , as well as trade in steel , bananas and beef .
it also comes just as america and europe are attempting to smooth over relations after a nasty rift opened due to the war in iraq . but zoellick was quick to dismiss speculation that the trade row could exacerbate the situtation .
" the u.s. and the eu have a large and important economic relationship , and disputes such as this , while very important , make up only one part of that relationship . "
he said the u.s. would continue to work with the eu to manage their disputes " in an appropriate way " . argentina , canada , and egypt have joined the u.s. in filing the wto case , which is also being supported by australia , chile , colombia , el salvador , honduras , mexico , new zealand , peru and uruguay .
the filing of the u.s.-led case triggers two months of talks between washington and brussels .
if these fail , zoellick said the u.s. would formally lodge its complaint , thereby starting a wto investigation which could take about 18 months . zoellick said scientific evidence showed that the european concerns were unjustified and that gmos should be allowed in just like any other product .
" people around the world have been eating biotech food for years . "
according to the reuters news agency , the trade dispute costs u.s. farmers about $ 300 million -lrb- € 260 million -rrb- a year in mostly lost corn sales . biotech crops are designed to better withstand insects and herbicides , but some critics fear they could be dangerous to both human health and the environment . europe says case is " unwarranted " the european commission in a statement said it regretted the u.s. decision to file the wto case .
it called the move " legally unwarranted , economically unfounded and politically unhelpful " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said the eu 's regulatory system for gmo authorization was in line with wto rules .
" it is clear , transparent and non-discriminatory , " he said . brussels explained that the eu 's regulatory system had been inadequate to address the complex technology involved in gmos .
a new framework , however , entered into force last october .
this has enabled biotech companies to submit revised applications for approval of agricultural biotech products , the commission said .
two cotton seed oils for food use had already been placed on the market following authorization under the new system . " bullying " the world consumer and environmental groups criticized the u.s. threat to sue .
they question the safety of biotech crops and say europeans have the right to decide for themselves whether to accept them .
environment group friends of the earth international -lrb- foei -rrb- called the move the latest in a series of u.s. attempts to block other countries ’ decisions to protect their environment , human health and social standards .
it said washington was using the wto to “ bully ” people into accepting food they don ’ t want . " if this attempt succeeds , the u.s. will force gm foods onto european markets regardless of the wishes of consumers , " said juan lopez of foei in brussels .
" the european commission and national governments must find the courage to stand up to this outrageous piece of bullying . " but zoellick told reporters the united states was not trying " to force the food " on anyone .
it just wanted to have " a fair chance " to sell biotech food in europe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us in new trade dispute over uranium the european commission and the u.s. are clashing over import duties on uranium , raising fears of another damaging trade dispute .

the suit was filed by human rights attorney jan fermon , who is a candidate for a parliament as a member of an obscure left-wing party in sunday 's national elections in belgium . it is made possible by a controversial belgian law that allows the country 's courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , regardless of where the crimes occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .

former president george bush and current vice president dick cheney , who was then secretary of defense , were also named in the case .
in its 36-22 vote in april , the belgian senate moved to rein in the law 's scope , effectively halting the two cases , and the country 's senior prosecutor now has the discretion to decide whether a complaint should be examined in belgium , referred back to the country concerned - if it has a sufficient record of democracy and fair justice - or passed on to the international criminal court in the hague .
officials in washington are hoping ferman 's case will hit a dead-end road in brussels .
the state department called on the belgium government to drop the case .
" we are pleased that the belgian government has taken action to change the law , " state department spokesman richard bouchar said on wednesday .
" but we believe the belgian government needs to be diligent in taking steps to prevent abuse of the legal system for political ends .
as to the specific case , we believe it does show the danger of a judicial system that 's open to politically motivated charges . "
still , ferman is intent on taking his chances .
he told journalists he had filed the case in belgium because it was not possible to go to the international criminal court , since the united states is not a member .

a trade dispute is threatening to sour transatlantic relations , after the united states announced plans to sue the europe union unless it opens its market to millions of dollars of genetically modified goods . the united states said on tuesday it intends to file a complaint against the european union with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- over the eu ’ s five-year ban on importing new genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- . " the eu 's moratorium violates wto rules , " said u.s. trade representative robert zoellick at a press conference in washington .
he said that the eu 's blocking tactics prevented the development of the technology which could help farmers and consumers throughout the world .
the eu has authorized no new gmos for release since october 1998 . " we 've waited patiently for five years for the eu to follow the wto rules , " zoellick said .
" for five years , we 've been told by european officials that a change in policy is just around the corner .
but around every corner we find a new roadblock . " strained transatlantic ties the current dispute follows spats between the united states and the european union over uranium and corporate tax breaks , as well as trade in steel , bananas and beef .
it also comes just as america and europe are attempting to smooth over relations after a nasty rift opened due to the war in iraq . but zoellick was quick to dismiss speculation that the trade row could exacerbate the situtation .
" the u.s. and the eu have a large and important economic relationship , and disputes such as this , while very important , make up only one part of that relationship . "
he said the u.s. would continue to work with the eu to manage their disputes " in an appropriate way " . argentina , canada , and egypt have joined the u.s. in filing the wto case , which is also being supported by australia , chile , colombia , el salvador , honduras , mexico , new zealand , peru and uruguay .
the filing of the u.s.-led case triggers two months of talks between washington and brussels .
if these fail , zoellick said the u.s. would formally lodge its complaint , thereby starting a wto investigation which could take about 18 months . zoellick said scientific evidence showed that the european concerns were unjustified and that gmos should be allowed in just like any other product .
" people around the world have been eating biotech food for years . "
according to the reuters news agency , the trade dispute costs u.s. farmers about $ 300 million -lrb- € 260 million -rrb- a year in mostly lost corn sales . biotech crops are designed to better withstand insects and herbicides , but some critics fear they could be dangerous to both human health and the environment . europe says case is " unwarranted " the european commission in a statement said it regretted the u.s. decision to file the wto case .
it called the move " legally unwarranted , economically unfounded and politically unhelpful " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said the eu 's regulatory system for gmo authorization was in line with wto rules .

a trade dispute is threatening to sour transatlantic relations , after the united states announced plans to sue the europe union unless it opens its market to millions of dollars of genetically modified goods . the united states said on tuesday it intends to file a complaint against the european union with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- over the eu ’ s five-year ban on importing new genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- .

in a major test to recent changes in belgium 's anti-genocide law , which allows foreign cases to be tried in brussels , a lawyer has filed a war crimes case on behalf of baghdad residents against two u.s. military leaders . in a development that could further complicate ties between belgium and the united states , a group of 19 iraqi civilians filed a war crimes lawsuit on wednesday against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. troops in the war against iraq , and col. brian mccoy .
the suit was filed by human rights attorney jan fermon , who is a candidate for a parliament as a member of an obscure left-wing party in sunday 's national elections in belgium . it is made possible by a controversial belgian law that allows the country 's courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , regardless of where the crimes occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
" this is no symbolic action , " fermon told reporters as he filed the papers with prosecutors in brussels .
" my mandates want an independent investigation of the events . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bombed out baghdad market .
the plaintiffs include the jordanian father and wife of an al-jazeera journalist killed when the arab broadcaster 's office was bombed , along with 17 baghdad residents affected by 17 alleged incidents , including attacks on ambulances , attacks with cluster bombs as well as the bombing of a crowded marketplace -lrb- photo -rrb- .
fermon claims he has evidence from belgian doctors who were working in baghdad with humanitarian relief organizations to back up the plaintiff 's claims .
u.s. could boycott brussels on tuesday , the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff threatened the belgium government that it may boycott the country as a venue for international meetings if it chooses to take up the case - a veiled threat that could have implications for nato , which has its headquarters in brussels .
u.s. and belgian ties were already tense enough over belgium 's refusal to support a military invasion of iraq .
" it 's looked upon by the u.s. government as a very , very serious situation , " gen. richard myers said tuesday during a visit to nato headquarters in brussels .
" it clearly could have a huge impact on where we gather . "

the move came under considerable international pressure from the united states and israel .

-lrb- ap photo / davis guttenfelder -rrb- israel recalled its ambassador for consultations in february because of a ruling at the time that threatened to prosecute prime minister ariel sharon after he leaves office and surrenders his diplomatic immunity .
the case was brought on by palestinians who claimed the leader was at the center of a 1982 massacre of two villages in lebanon .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake after he was named in march in a lawsuit over the deaths of 403 people in the 1991 bombing of a baghdad shelter in the persian gulf war .
former president george bush and current vice president dick cheney , who was then secretary of defense , were also named in the case .
in its 36-22 vote in april , the belgian senate moved to rein in the law 's scope , effectively halting the two cases , and the country 's senior prosecutor now has the discretion to decide whether a complaint should be examined in belgium , referred back to the country concerned - if it has a sufficient record of democracy and fair justice - or passed on to the international criminal court in the hague .
officials in washington are hoping ferman 's case will hit a dead-end road in brussels .
the state department called on the belgium government to drop the case .
" we are pleased that the belgian government has taken action to change the law , " state department spokesman richard bouchar said on wednesday .
" but we believe the belgian government needs to be diligent in taking steps to prevent abuse of the legal system for political ends .
as to the specific case , we believe it does show the danger of a judicial system that 's open to politically motivated charges . "
still , ferman is intent on taking his chances .
he told journalists he had filed the case in belgium because it was not possible to go to the international criminal court , since the united states is not a member .

in a major test to recent changes in belgium 's anti-genocide law , which allows foreign cases to be tried in brussels , a lawyer has filed a war crimes case on behalf of baghdad residents against two u.s. military leaders . in a development that could further complicate ties between belgium and the united states , a group of 19 iraqi civilians filed a war crimes lawsuit on wednesday against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. troops in the war against iraq , and col. brian mccoy .
the suit was filed by human rights attorney jan fermon , who is a candidate for a parliament as a member of an obscure left-wing party in sunday 's national elections in belgium . it is made possible by a controversial belgian law that allows the country 's courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , regardless of where the crimes occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
" this is no symbolic action , " fermon told reporters as he filed the papers with prosecutors in brussels .
" my mandates want an independent investigation of the events . "

" it clearly could have a huge impact on where we gather . "

a trade dispute is threatening to sour transatlantic relations , after the united states announced plans to sue the europe union unless it opens its market to millions of dollars of genetically modified goods . the united states said on tuesday it intends to file a complaint against the european union with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- over the eu ’ s five-year ban on importing new genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- . " the eu 's moratorium violates wto rules , " said u.s. trade representative robert zoellick at a press conference in washington .
he said that the eu 's blocking tactics prevented the development of the technology which could help farmers and consumers throughout the world .
the eu has authorized no new gmos for release since october 1998 . " we 've waited patiently for five years for the eu to follow the wto rules , " zoellick said .
" for five years , we 've been told by european officials that a change in policy is just around the corner .
but around every corner we find a new roadblock . " strained transatlantic ties the current dispute follows spats between the united states and the european union over uranium and corporate tax breaks , as well as trade in steel , bananas and beef .
it also comes just as america and europe are attempting to smooth over relations after a nasty rift opened due to the war in iraq . but zoellick was quick to dismiss speculation that the trade row could exacerbate the situtation .
" the u.s. and the eu have a large and important economic relationship , and disputes such as this , while very important , make up only one part of that relationship . "
he said the u.s. would continue to work with the eu to manage their disputes " in an appropriate way " . argentina , canada , and egypt have joined the u.s. in filing the wto case , which is also being supported by australia , chile , colombia , el salvador , honduras , mexico , new zealand , peru and uruguay .
the filing of the u.s.-led case triggers two months of talks between washington and brussels .
if these fail , zoellick said the u.s. would formally lodge its complaint , thereby starting a wto investigation which could take about 18 months . zoellick said scientific evidence showed that the european concerns were unjustified and that gmos should be allowed in just like any other product .
" people around the world have been eating biotech food for years . "
according to the reuters news agency , the trade dispute costs u.s. farmers about $ 300 million -lrb- € 260 million -rrb- a year in mostly lost corn sales . biotech crops are designed to better withstand insects and herbicides , but some critics fear they could be dangerous to both human health and the environment . europe says case is " unwarranted " the european commission in a statement said it regretted the u.s. decision to file the wto case .
it called the move " legally unwarranted , economically unfounded and politically unhelpful " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said the eu 's regulatory system for gmo authorization was in line with wto rules .
" it is clear , transparent and non-discriminatory , " he said . brussels explained that the eu 's regulatory system had been inadequate to address the complex technology involved in gmos .
a new framework , however , entered into force last october .
this has enabled biotech companies to submit revised applications for approval of agricultural biotech products , the commission said .
two cotton seed oils for food use had already been placed on the market following authorization under the new system . " bullying " the world consumer and environmental groups criticized the u.s. threat to sue .
they question the safety of biotech crops and say europeans have the right to decide for themselves whether to accept them .
environment group friends of the earth international -lrb- foei -rrb- called the move the latest in a series of u.s. attempts to block other countries ’ decisions to protect their environment , human health and social standards .

a trade dispute is threatening to sour transatlantic relations , after the united states announced plans to sue the europe union unless it opens its market to millions of dollars of genetically modified goods . the united states said on tuesday it intends to file a complaint against the european union with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- over the eu ’ s five-year ban on importing new genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- . " the eu 's moratorium violates wto rules , " said u.s. trade representative robert zoellick at a press conference in washington .
he said that the eu 's blocking tactics prevented the development of the technology which could help farmers and consumers throughout the world .
the eu has authorized no new gmos for release since october 1998 . " we 've waited patiently for five years for the eu to follow the wto rules , " zoellick said .
" for five years , we 've been told by european officials that a change in policy is just around the corner .
but around every corner we find a new roadblock . " strained transatlantic ties the current dispute follows spats between the united states and the european union over uranium and corporate tax breaks , as well as trade in steel , bananas and beef .
it also comes just as america and europe are attempting to smooth over relations after a nasty rift opened due to the war in iraq . but zoellick was quick to dismiss speculation that the trade row could exacerbate the situtation .
" the u.s. and the eu have a large and important economic relationship , and disputes such as this , while very important , make up only one part of that relationship . "
he said the u.s. would continue to work with the eu to manage their disputes " in an appropriate way " . argentina , canada , and egypt have joined the u.s. in filing the wto case , which is also being supported by australia , chile , colombia , el salvador , honduras , mexico , new zealand , peru and uruguay .
the filing of the u.s.-led case triggers two months of talks between washington and brussels .
if these fail , zoellick said the u.s. would formally lodge its complaint , thereby starting a wto investigation which could take about 18 months . zoellick said scientific evidence showed that the european concerns were unjustified and that gmos should be allowed in just like any other product .
" people around the world have been eating biotech food for years . "
according to the reuters news agency , the trade dispute costs u.s. farmers about $ 300 million -lrb- € 260 million -rrb- a year in mostly lost corn sales . biotech crops are designed to better withstand insects and herbicides , but some critics fear they could be dangerous to both human health and the environment . europe says case is " unwarranted " the european commission in a statement said it regretted the u.s. decision to file the wto case .
it called the move " legally unwarranted , economically unfounded and politically unhelpful " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said the eu 's regulatory system for gmo authorization was in line with wto rules .
" it is clear , transparent and non-discriminatory , " he said . brussels explained that the eu 's regulatory system had been inadequate to address the complex technology involved in gmos .
a new framework , however , entered into force last october .
this has enabled biotech companies to submit revised applications for approval of agricultural biotech products , the commission said .
two cotton seed oils for food use had already been placed on the market following authorization under the new system . " bullying " the world consumer and environmental groups criticized the u.s. threat to sue .
they question the safety of biotech crops and say europeans have the right to decide for themselves whether to accept them .
environment group friends of the earth international -lrb- foei -rrb- called the move the latest in a series of u.s. attempts to block other countries ’ decisions to protect their environment , human health and social standards .
it said washington was using the wto to “ bully ” people into accepting food they don ’ t want . " if this attempt succeeds , the u.s. will force gm foods onto european markets regardless of the wishes of consumers , " said juan lopez of foei in brussels .
" the european commission and national governments must find the courage to stand up to this outrageous piece of bullying . " but zoellick told reporters the united states was not trying " to force the food " on anyone .

in a major test to recent changes in belgium 's anti-genocide law , which allows foreign cases to be tried in brussels , a lawyer has filed a war crimes case on behalf of baghdad residents against two u.s. military leaders . in a development that could further complicate ties between belgium and the united states , a group of 19 iraqi civilians filed a war crimes lawsuit on wednesday against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. troops in the war against iraq , and col. brian mccoy .
the suit was filed by human rights attorney jan fermon , who is a candidate for a parliament as a member of an obscure left-wing party in sunday 's national elections in belgium . it is made possible by a controversial belgian law that allows the country 's courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , regardless of where the crimes occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
" this is no symbolic action , " fermon told reporters as he filed the papers with prosecutors in brussels .
" my mandates want an independent investigation of the events . "

the plaintiffs include the jordanian father and wife of an al-jazeera journalist killed when the arab broadcaster 's office was bombed , along with 17 baghdad residents affected by 17 alleged incidents , including attacks on ambulances , attacks with cluster bombs as well as the bombing of a crowded marketplace -lrb- photo -rrb- .
fermon claims he has evidence from belgian doctors who were working in baghdad with humanitarian relief organizations to back up the plaintiff 's claims .
u.s. could boycott brussels on tuesday , the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff threatened the belgium government that it may boycott the country as a venue for international meetings if it chooses to take up the case - a veiled threat that could have implications for nato , which has its headquarters in brussels .
u.s. and belgian ties were already tense enough over belgium 's refusal to support a military invasion of iraq .

" it clearly could have a huge impact on where we gather . "

-lrb- ap photo / davis guttenfelder -rrb- israel recalled its ambassador for consultations in february because of a ruling at the time that threatened to prosecute prime minister ariel sharon after he leaves office and surrenders his diplomatic immunity .
the case was brought on by palestinians who claimed the leader was at the center of a 1982 massacre of two villages in lebanon .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake after he was named in march in a lawsuit over the deaths of 403 people in the 1991 bombing of a baghdad shelter in the persian gulf war .
former president george bush and current vice president dick cheney , who was then secretary of defense , were also named in the case .
in its 36-22 vote in april , the belgian senate moved to rein in the law 's scope , effectively halting the two cases , and the country 's senior prosecutor now has the discretion to decide whether a complaint should be examined in belgium , referred back to the country concerned - if it has a sufficient record of democracy and fair justice - or passed on to the international criminal court in the hague .
officials in washington are hoping ferman 's case will hit a dead-end road in brussels .
the state department called on the belgium government to drop the case .
" we are pleased that the belgian government has taken action to change the law , " state department spokesman richard bouchar said on wednesday .
" but we believe the belgian government needs to be diligent in taking steps to prevent abuse of the legal system for political ends .

recent early exits from major tournaments have compounded the frustration of germany 's latest crop of tennis players .
for the former tennis superpower , the continued under-achievement is hard to take . if you can hear applause at the end of a tennis match featuring one of the latest breed of german stars these days , chances are it will be for the other player .
the winner , in other words .

facing bankruptcy as with many sports facing a crisis , money seems to be the root of the current evil german tennis finds itself faced with .
last year , the german tennis federation faced bankruptcy and only a last-minute agreement saved the governing body from the ignominy of collapse .
the federation eventually struck a deal with its creditor banks in december with the prospect of a lean christmas chilling german bones .
the banks finally agreed to drop € 3.47 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- of debt and gave the organization four years to pay back another € 3.47 million .
the state tennis federations contributed a further € 800,000 .
the national federation also made cost-cutting promises , planning to trim down prize money at german events .
the arrangement struck last year also ensured the survival of two of germany 's most prestigious clay court tournaments - the two where germany 's stars have most recently faltered : the women 's german open in berlin and the men 's event in hamburg .
" we now have a good economic perspective for the coming year and the chance to reach stability , " said german tennis federation president georg von waldenfels at the time .

german tennis fans can look back with misty eyes to the halcyon period of the mid-1980s to mid-1990s when becker and stich dominated the men 's game and graf was consistently the number one woman .
those who wish to reminisce would be hard pushed to find a more worthy memory than the moment a 17-year-old boris took the crown at wimbledon .
solace in recent failures may be gained from reviewing the staggering number of titles graf took during her career .
if you 're looking for comfort to see you through these barren times , mrs. agassi won 22 grand slam championships and numerous others of the woman 's tour circuit .
failing that , someone must have a video of the 1991 wimbledon championships where stich beat jim courier , defending champion stefan edberg and three-time winner boris becker in consecutive rounds to lift the all england club 's golden cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all balls for michael stich .
if that 's not enough to ease the pain of watching the fallen giant regularly exiting major tennis championships across the globe , then you can brave the creaking knees of the master 's circuit where boris and michael continue to bash little yellow balls at each other in their eternal rivalry .
those fans looking to the future may even be dreaming of the day when little noah and elias becker meet to battle over the world 's most prestigious titles just as the williams sisters do today .

a trade dispute is threatening to sour transatlantic relations , after the united states announced plans to sue the europe union unless it opens its market to millions of dollars of genetically modified goods . the united states said on tuesday it intends to file a complaint against the european union with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- over the eu ’ s five-year ban on importing new genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- . " the eu 's moratorium violates wto rules , " said u.s. trade representative robert zoellick at a press conference in washington .
he said that the eu 's blocking tactics prevented the development of the technology which could help farmers and consumers throughout the world .
the eu has authorized no new gmos for release since october 1998 . " we 've waited patiently for five years for the eu to follow the wto rules , " zoellick said .
" for five years , we 've been told by european officials that a change in policy is just around the corner .
but around every corner we find a new roadblock . " strained transatlantic ties the current dispute follows spats between the united states and the european union over uranium and corporate tax breaks , as well as trade in steel , bananas and beef .
it also comes just as america and europe are attempting to smooth over relations after a nasty rift opened due to the war in iraq . but zoellick was quick to dismiss speculation that the trade row could exacerbate the situtation .

the suit was filed by human rights attorney jan fermon , who is a candidate for a parliament as a member of an obscure left-wing party in sunday 's national elections in belgium . it is made possible by a controversial belgian law that allows the country 's courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , regardless of where the crimes occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.05.2003 genetic food trade dispute adds strain to us-eu ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. wants european cows - and consumers - to have the choice to eat genetically modified food .
a trade dispute is threatening to sour transatlantic relations , after the united states announced plans to sue the europe union unless it opens its market to millions of dollars of genetically modified goods . the united states said on tuesday it intends to file a complaint against the european union with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- over the eu ’ s five-year ban on importing new genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- . " the eu 's moratorium violates wto rules , " said u.s. trade representative robert zoellick at a press conference in washington .
he said that the eu 's blocking tactics prevented the development of the technology which could help farmers and consumers throughout the world .
the eu has authorized no new gmos for release since october 1998 . " we 've waited patiently for five years for the eu to follow the wto rules , " zoellick said .
" for five years , we 've been told by european officials that a change in policy is just around the corner .
but around every corner we find a new roadblock . " strained transatlantic ties the current dispute follows spats between the united states and the european union over uranium and corporate tax breaks , as well as trade in steel , bananas and beef .
it also comes just as america and europe are attempting to smooth over relations after a nasty rift opened due to the war in iraq . but zoellick was quick to dismiss speculation that the trade row could exacerbate the situtation .
" the u.s. and the eu have a large and important economic relationship , and disputes such as this , while very important , make up only one part of that relationship . "
he said the u.s. would continue to work with the eu to manage their disputes " in an appropriate way " . argentina , canada , and egypt have joined the u.s. in filing the wto case , which is also being supported by australia , chile , colombia , el salvador , honduras , mexico , new zealand , peru and uruguay .
the filing of the u.s.-led case triggers two months of talks between washington and brussels .
if these fail , zoellick said the u.s. would formally lodge its complaint , thereby starting a wto investigation which could take about 18 months . zoellick said scientific evidence showed that the european concerns were unjustified and that gmos should be allowed in just like any other product .
" people around the world have been eating biotech food for years . "
according to the reuters news agency , the trade dispute costs u.s. farmers about $ 300 million -lrb- € 260 million -rrb- a year in mostly lost corn sales . biotech crops are designed to better withstand insects and herbicides , but some critics fear they could be dangerous to both human health and the environment . europe says case is " unwarranted " the european commission in a statement said it regretted the u.s. decision to file the wto case .
it called the move " legally unwarranted , economically unfounded and politically unhelpful " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said the eu 's regulatory system for gmo authorization was in line with wto rules .
" it is clear , transparent and non-discriminatory , " he said . brussels explained that the eu 's regulatory system had been inadequate to address the complex technology involved in gmos .
a new framework , however , entered into force last october .
this has enabled biotech companies to submit revised applications for approval of agricultural biotech products , the commission said .

a trade dispute is threatening to sour transatlantic relations , after the united states announced plans to sue the europe union unless it opens its market to millions of dollars of genetically modified goods . the united states said on tuesday it intends to file a complaint against the european union with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- over the eu ’ s five-year ban on importing new genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- . " the eu 's moratorium violates wto rules , " said u.s. trade representative robert zoellick at a press conference in washington .
he said that the eu 's blocking tactics prevented the development of the technology which could help farmers and consumers throughout the world .
the eu has authorized no new gmos for release since october 1998 . " we 've waited patiently for five years for the eu to follow the wto rules , " zoellick said .
" for five years , we 've been told by european officials that a change in policy is just around the corner .
but around every corner we find a new roadblock . " strained transatlantic ties the current dispute follows spats between the united states and the european union over uranium and corporate tax breaks , as well as trade in steel , bananas and beef .
it also comes just as america and europe are attempting to smooth over relations after a nasty rift opened due to the war in iraq . but zoellick was quick to dismiss speculation that the trade row could exacerbate the situtation .
" the u.s. and the eu have a large and important economic relationship , and disputes such as this , while very important , make up only one part of that relationship . "
he said the u.s. would continue to work with the eu to manage their disputes " in an appropriate way " . argentina , canada , and egypt have joined the u.s. in filing the wto case , which is also being supported by australia , chile , colombia , el salvador , honduras , mexico , new zealand , peru and uruguay .
the filing of the u.s.-led case triggers two months of talks between washington and brussels .
if these fail , zoellick said the u.s. would formally lodge its complaint , thereby starting a wto investigation which could take about 18 months . zoellick said scientific evidence showed that the european concerns were unjustified and that gmos should be allowed in just like any other product .
" people around the world have been eating biotech food for years . "
according to the reuters news agency , the trade dispute costs u.s. farmers about $ 300 million -lrb- € 260 million -rrb- a year in mostly lost corn sales . biotech crops are designed to better withstand insects and herbicides , but some critics fear they could be dangerous to both human health and the environment . europe says case is " unwarranted " the european commission in a statement said it regretted the u.s. decision to file the wto case .
it called the move " legally unwarranted , economically unfounded and politically unhelpful " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said the eu 's regulatory system for gmo authorization was in line with wto rules .
" it is clear , transparent and non-discriminatory , " he said . brussels explained that the eu 's regulatory system had been inadequate to address the complex technology involved in gmos .
a new framework , however , entered into force last october .
this has enabled biotech companies to submit revised applications for approval of agricultural biotech products , the commission said .

in a major test to recent changes in belgium 's anti-genocide law , which allows foreign cases to be tried in brussels , a lawyer has filed a war crimes case on behalf of baghdad residents against two u.s. military leaders . in a development that could further complicate ties between belgium and the united states , a group of 19 iraqi civilians filed a war crimes lawsuit on wednesday against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. troops in the war against iraq , and col. brian mccoy .
the suit was filed by human rights attorney jan fermon , who is a candidate for a parliament as a member of an obscure left-wing party in sunday 's national elections in belgium . it is made possible by a controversial belgian law that allows the country 's courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , regardless of where the crimes occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
" this is no symbolic action , " fermon told reporters as he filed the papers with prosecutors in brussels .
" my mandates want an independent investigation of the events . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bombed out baghdad market .

the suit was filed by human rights attorney jan fermon , who is a candidate for a parliament as a member of an obscure left-wing party in sunday 's national elections in belgium . it is made possible by a controversial belgian law that allows the country 's courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , regardless of where the crimes occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .

a trade dispute is threatening to sour transatlantic relations , after the united states announced plans to sue the europe union unless it opens its market to millions of dollars of genetically modified goods . the united states said on tuesday it intends to file a complaint against the european union with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- over the eu ’ s five-year ban on importing new genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- . " the eu 's moratorium violates wto rules , " said u.s. trade representative robert zoellick at a press conference in washington .
he said that the eu 's blocking tactics prevented the development of the technology which could help farmers and consumers throughout the world .
the eu has authorized no new gmos for release since october 1998 . " we 've waited patiently for five years for the eu to follow the wto rules , " zoellick said .
" for five years , we 've been told by european officials that a change in policy is just around the corner .
but around every corner we find a new roadblock . " strained transatlantic ties the current dispute follows spats between the united states and the european union over uranium and corporate tax breaks , as well as trade in steel , bananas and beef .
it also comes just as america and europe are attempting to smooth over relations after a nasty rift opened due to the war in iraq . but zoellick was quick to dismiss speculation that the trade row could exacerbate the situtation .
" the u.s. and the eu have a large and important economic relationship , and disputes such as this , while very important , make up only one part of that relationship . "
he said the u.s. would continue to work with the eu to manage their disputes " in an appropriate way " . argentina , canada , and egypt have joined the u.s. in filing the wto case , which is also being supported by australia , chile , colombia , el salvador , honduras , mexico , new zealand , peru and uruguay .
the filing of the u.s.-led case triggers two months of talks between washington and brussels .
if these fail , zoellick said the u.s. would formally lodge its complaint , thereby starting a wto investigation which could take about 18 months . zoellick said scientific evidence showed that the european concerns were unjustified and that gmos should be allowed in just like any other product .
" people around the world have been eating biotech food for years . "
according to the reuters news agency , the trade dispute costs u.s. farmers about $ 300 million -lrb- € 260 million -rrb- a year in mostly lost corn sales . biotech crops are designed to better withstand insects and herbicides , but some critics fear they could be dangerous to both human health and the environment . europe says case is " unwarranted " the european commission in a statement said it regretted the u.s. decision to file the wto case .
it called the move " legally unwarranted , economically unfounded and politically unhelpful " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said the eu 's regulatory system for gmo authorization was in line with wto rules .
" it is clear , transparent and non-discriminatory , " he said . brussels explained that the eu 's regulatory system had been inadequate to address the complex technology involved in gmos .
a new framework , however , entered into force last october .
this has enabled biotech companies to submit revised applications for approval of agricultural biotech products , the commission said .
two cotton seed oils for food use had already been placed on the market following authorization under the new system . " bullying " the world consumer and environmental groups criticized the u.s. threat to sue .
they question the safety of biotech crops and say europeans have the right to decide for themselves whether to accept them .
environment group friends of the earth international -lrb- foei -rrb- called the move the latest in a series of u.s. attempts to block other countries ’ decisions to protect their environment , human health and social standards .
it said washington was using the wto to “ bully ” people into accepting food they don ’ t want . " if this attempt succeeds , the u.s. will force gm foods onto european markets regardless of the wishes of consumers , " said juan lopez of foei in brussels .
" the european commission and national governments must find the courage to stand up to this outrageous piece of bullying . " but zoellick told reporters the united states was not trying " to force the food " on anyone .
it just wanted to have " a fair chance " to sell biotech food in europe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe , us in new trade dispute over uranium the european commission and the u.s. are clashing over import duties on uranium , raising fears of another damaging trade dispute .

in a major test to recent changes in belgium 's anti-genocide law , which allows foreign cases to be tried in brussels , a lawyer has filed a war crimes case on behalf of baghdad residents against two u.s. military leaders . in a development that could further complicate ties between belgium and the united states , a group of 19 iraqi civilians filed a war crimes lawsuit on wednesday against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. troops in the war against iraq , and col. brian mccoy .
the suit was filed by human rights attorney jan fermon , who is a candidate for a parliament as a member of an obscure left-wing party in sunday 's national elections in belgium . it is made possible by a controversial belgian law that allows the country 's courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , regardless of where the crimes occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
" this is no symbolic action , " fermon told reporters as he filed the papers with prosecutors in brussels .
" my mandates want an independent investigation of the events . "

the plaintiffs include the jordanian father and wife of an al-jazeera journalist killed when the arab broadcaster 's office was bombed , along with 17 baghdad residents affected by 17 alleged incidents , including attacks on ambulances , attacks with cluster bombs as well as the bombing of a crowded marketplace -lrb- photo -rrb- .

u.s. and belgian ties were already tense enough over belgium 's refusal to support a military invasion of iraq .

" it clearly could have a huge impact on where we gather . "

following tuesday 's election victory sharon faces a difficult task in forming a government that has the support of the fractured parliament .
-lrb- ap photo / davis guttenfelder -rrb- israel recalled its ambassador for consultations in february because of a ruling at the time that threatened to prosecute prime minister ariel sharon after he leaves office and surrenders his diplomatic immunity .
the case was brought on by palestinians who claimed the leader was at the center of a 1982 massacre of two villages in lebanon .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake after he was named in march in a lawsuit over the deaths of 403 people in the 1991 bombing of a baghdad shelter in the persian gulf war .
former president george bush and current vice president dick cheney , who was then secretary of defense , were also named in the case .
in its 36-22 vote in april , the belgian senate moved to rein in the law 's scope , effectively halting the two cases , and the country 's senior prosecutor now has the discretion to decide whether a complaint should be examined in belgium , referred back to the country concerned - if it has a sufficient record of democracy and fair justice - or passed on to the international criminal court in the hague .
officials in washington are hoping ferman 's case will hit a dead-end road in brussels .
the state department called on the belgium government to drop the case .
" we are pleased that the belgian government has taken action to change the law , " state department spokesman richard bouchar said on wednesday .
" but we believe the belgian government needs to be diligent in taking steps to prevent abuse of the legal system for political ends .
as to the specific case , we believe it does show the danger of a judicial system that 's open to politically motivated charges . "
still , ferman is intent on taking his chances .
he told journalists he had filed the case in belgium because it was not possible to go to the international criminal court , since the united states is not a member .
only one case has been brought to court since the 1993 law was enacted .

recent early exits from major tournaments have compounded the frustration of germany 's latest crop of tennis players .
for the former tennis superpower , the continued under-achievement is hard to take . if you can hear applause at the end of a tennis match featuring one of the latest breed of german stars these days , chances are it will be for the other player .
the winner , in other words .
it seems the golden days of boris becker , steffi graf and michael stich are now firmly the stuff of legend , as germany 's most recent crop continues to under-achieve .
not including the blip on the form guide that allowed tommy haas to reach the semi-finals of the australian open and gave rainer schüttler passage to the melbourne final in january , germany 's rising stars have yet to reach the stratospheric heights once dominated by their fellow countrymen and women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home in time for tea : nic kiefer the most recent disappointing evidence of germany 's decline comes from the masters tournaments played out on the courts of europe over the last two months .
excluding schüttler 's progress to the quarter-final in the italian masters in rome , germany 's players have most recently faltered in the early stages on home soil in the berlin and hamburg opens .
in the women 's championships in berlin a week ago , both anca barna and marlene weingartner crashed out in the second round , while nicolas kiefer made an even earlier exit in hamburg a few days later , surrendering in the first .
a once proud and talented tennis nation , germany 's recent problems can not be blamed purely on the lack of naturally gifted stars .
those who represent their country are far from being any old sloggers you could find wheezing through a knock-about in the local park on a lazy sunday .
so where did it all go wrong ?
facing bankruptcy as with many sports facing a crisis , money seems to be the root of the current evil german tennis finds itself faced with .
last year , the german tennis federation faced bankruptcy and only a last-minute agreement saved the governing body from the ignominy of collapse .
the federation eventually struck a deal with its creditor banks in december with the prospect of a lean christmas chilling german bones .
the banks finally agreed to drop € 3.47 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- of debt and gave the organization four years to pay back another € 3.47 million .
the state tennis federations contributed a further € 800,000 .
the national federation also made cost-cutting promises , planning to trim down prize money at german events .
the arrangement struck last year also ensured the survival of two of germany 's most prestigious clay court tournaments - the two where germany 's stars have most recently faltered : the women 's german open in berlin and the men 's event in hamburg .
" we now have a good economic perspective for the coming year and the chance to reach stability , " said german tennis federation president georg von waldenfels at the time .
it was an optimistic response from the head of an organization that continues to be hit by declining television revenues , loss of sponsors and plummeting interest among the german public that has been nose-diving since germany 's big name players retired from the sport .
halcyon days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those were the days .
but it was once all so very different .
german tennis fans can look back with misty eyes to the halcyon period of the mid-1980s to mid-1990s when becker and stich dominated the men 's game and graf was consistently the number one woman .
those who wish to reminisce would be hard pushed to find a more worthy memory than the moment a 17-year-old boris took the crown at wimbledon .
solace in recent failures may be gained from reviewing the staggering number of titles graf took during her career .
if you 're looking for comfort to see you through these barren times , mrs. agassi won 22 grand slam championships and numerous others of the woman 's tour circuit .
failing that , someone must have a video of the 1991 wimbledon championships where stich beat jim courier , defending champion stefan edberg and three-time winner boris becker in consecutive rounds to lift the all england club 's golden cup .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all balls for michael stich .
if that 's not enough to ease the pain of watching the fallen giant regularly exiting major tennis championships across the globe , then you can brave the creaking knees of the master 's circuit where boris and michael continue to bash little yellow balls at each other in their eternal rivalry .
those fans looking to the future may even be dreaming of the day when little noah and elias becker meet to battle over the world 's most prestigious titles just as the williams sisters do today .
then again , jaiden gil agassi might have something to say about that . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german 's grand slam dream over in oz the grand slam dream of germany 's rainer schüttler went up in flames in the sweltering melbourne heat on sunday as a scorching display by andre agassi secured the american his fourth australian open title .

a trade dispute is threatening to sour transatlantic relations , after the united states announced plans to sue the europe union unless it opens its market to millions of dollars of genetically modified goods . the united states said on tuesday it intends to file a complaint against the european union with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- over the eu ’ s five-year ban on importing new genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- . " the eu 's moratorium violates wto rules , " said u.s. trade representative robert zoellick at a press conference in washington .
he said that the eu 's blocking tactics prevented the development of the technology which could help farmers and consumers throughout the world .
the eu has authorized no new gmos for release since october 1998 . " we 've waited patiently for five years for the eu to follow the wto rules , " zoellick said .
" for five years , we 've been told by european officials that a change in policy is just around the corner .
but around every corner we find a new roadblock . " strained transatlantic ties the current dispute follows spats between the united states and the european union over uranium and corporate tax breaks , as well as trade in steel , bananas and beef .
it also comes just as america and europe are attempting to smooth over relations after a nasty rift opened due to the war in iraq . but zoellick was quick to dismiss speculation that the trade row could exacerbate the situtation .
" the u.s. and the eu have a large and important economic relationship , and disputes such as this , while very important , make up only one part of that relationship . "
he said the u.s. would continue to work with the eu to manage their disputes " in an appropriate way " . argentina , canada , and egypt have joined the u.s. in filing the wto case , which is also being supported by australia , chile , colombia , el salvador , honduras , mexico , new zealand , peru and uruguay .
the filing of the u.s.-led case triggers two months of talks between washington and brussels .
if these fail , zoellick said the u.s. would formally lodge its complaint , thereby starting a wto investigation which could take about 18 months . zoellick said scientific evidence showed that the european concerns were unjustified and that gmos should be allowed in just like any other product .
" people around the world have been eating biotech food for years . "
according to the reuters news agency , the trade dispute costs u.s. farmers about $ 300 million -lrb- € 260 million -rrb- a year in mostly lost corn sales . biotech crops are designed to better withstand insects and herbicides , but some critics fear they could be dangerous to both human health and the environment . europe says case is " unwarranted " the european commission in a statement said it regretted the u.s. decision to file the wto case .
it called the move " legally unwarranted , economically unfounded and politically unhelpful " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy eu trade commissioner pascal lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said the eu 's regulatory system for gmo authorization was in line with wto rules .
" it is clear , transparent and non-discriminatory , " he said . brussels explained that the eu 's regulatory system had been inadequate to address the complex technology involved in gmos .
a new framework , however , entered into force last october .
this has enabled biotech companies to submit revised applications for approval of agricultural biotech products , the commission said .
two cotton seed oils for food use had already been placed on the market following authorization under the new system . " bullying " the world consumer and environmental groups criticized the u.s. threat to sue .
they question the safety of biotech crops and say europeans have the right to decide for themselves whether to accept them .
environment group friends of the earth international -lrb- foei -rrb- called the move the latest in a series of u.s. attempts to block other countries ’ decisions to protect their environment , human health and social standards .
it said washington was using the wto to “ bully ” people into accepting food they don ’ t want . " if this attempt succeeds , the u.s. will force gm foods onto european markets regardless of the wishes of consumers , " said juan lopez of foei in brussels .
" the european commission and national governments must find the courage to stand up to this outrageous piece of bullying . " but zoellick told reporters the united states was not trying " to force the food " on anyone .

a trade dispute is threatening to sour transatlantic relations , after the united states announced plans to sue the europe union unless it opens its market to millions of dollars of genetically modified goods . the united states said on tuesday it intends to file a complaint against the european union with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- over the eu ’ s five-year ban on importing new genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- . " the eu 's moratorium violates wto rules , " said u.s. trade representative robert zoellick at a press conference in washington .
he said that the eu 's blocking tactics prevented the development of the technology which could help farmers and consumers throughout the world .
the eu has authorized no new gmos for release since october 1998 . " we 've waited patiently for five years for the eu to follow the wto rules , " zoellick said .
" for five years , we 've been told by european officials that a change in policy is just around the corner .
but around every corner we find a new roadblock . " strained transatlantic ties the current dispute follows spats between the united states and the european union over uranium and corporate tax breaks , as well as trade in steel , bananas and beef .
it also comes just as america and europe are attempting to smooth over relations after a nasty rift opened due to the war in iraq . but zoellick was quick to dismiss speculation that the trade row could exacerbate the situtation .
" the u.s. and the eu have a large and important economic relationship , and disputes such as this , while very important , make up only one part of that relationship . "
he said the u.s. would continue to work with the eu to manage their disputes " in an appropriate way " . argentina , canada , and egypt have joined the u.s. in filing the wto case , which is also being supported by australia , chile , colombia , el salvador , honduras , mexico , new zealand , peru and uruguay .
the filing of the u.s.-led case triggers two months of talks between washington and brussels .
if these fail , zoellick said the u.s. would formally lodge its complaint , thereby starting a wto investigation which could take about 18 months . zoellick said scientific evidence showed that the european concerns were unjustified and that gmos should be allowed in just like any other product .
" people around the world have been eating biotech food for years . "
according to the reuters news agency , the trade dispute costs u.s. farmers about $ 300 million -lrb- € 260 million -rrb- a year in mostly lost corn sales . biotech crops are designed to better withstand insects and herbicides , but some critics fear they could be dangerous to both human health and the environment . europe says case is " unwarranted " the european commission in a statement said it regretted the u.s. decision to file the wto case .

in a major test to recent changes in belgium 's anti-genocide law , which allows foreign cases to be tried in brussels , a lawyer has filed a war crimes case on behalf of baghdad residents against two u.s. military leaders . in a development that could further complicate ties between belgium and the united states , a group of 19 iraqi civilians filed a war crimes lawsuit on wednesday against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. troops in the war against iraq , and col. brian mccoy .
the suit was filed by human rights attorney jan fermon , who is a candidate for a parliament as a member of an obscure left-wing party in sunday 's national elections in belgium . it is made possible by a controversial belgian law that allows the country 's courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , regardless of where the crimes occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
" this is no symbolic action , " fermon told reporters as he filed the papers with prosecutors in brussels .
" my mandates want an independent investigation of the events . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bombed out baghdad market .
the plaintiffs include the jordanian father and wife of an al-jazeera journalist killed when the arab broadcaster 's office was bombed , along with 17 baghdad residents affected by 17 alleged incidents , including attacks on ambulances , attacks with cluster bombs as well as the bombing of a crowded marketplace -lrb- photo -rrb- .
fermon claims he has evidence from belgian doctors who were working in baghdad with humanitarian relief organizations to back up the plaintiff 's claims .
u.s. could boycott brussels on tuesday , the chairman of the pentagon 's joint chiefs of staff threatened the belgium government that it may boycott the country as a venue for international meetings if it chooses to take up the case - a veiled threat that could have implications for nato , which has its headquarters in brussels .
u.s. and belgian ties were already tense enough over belgium 's refusal to support a military invasion of iraq .
" it 's looked upon by the u.s. government as a very , very serious situation , " gen. richard myers said tuesday during a visit to nato headquarters in brussels .
" it clearly could have a huge impact on where we gather . "
test of new belgian law the case will be the first major test of a recently passed revision of the belgian law , which gives prosecutors more discretion to throw out cases filed under the rule .
the move came under considerable international pressure from the united states and israel .

7 , 2001 .
following tuesday 's election victory sharon faces a difficult task in forming a government that has the support of the fractured parliament .
-lrb- ap photo / davis guttenfelder -rrb- israel recalled its ambassador for consultations in february because of a ruling at the time that threatened to prosecute prime minister ariel sharon after he leaves office and surrenders his diplomatic immunity .
the case was brought on by palestinians who claimed the leader was at the center of a 1982 massacre of two villages in lebanon .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake after he was named in march in a lawsuit over the deaths of 403 people in the 1991 bombing of a baghdad shelter in the persian gulf war .
former president george bush and current vice president dick cheney , who was then secretary of defense , were also named in the case .
in its 36-22 vote in april , the belgian senate moved to rein in the law 's scope , effectively halting the two cases , and the country 's senior prosecutor now has the discretion to decide whether a complaint should be examined in belgium , referred back to the country concerned - if it has a sufficient record of democracy and fair justice - or passed on to the international criminal court in the hague .
officials in washington are hoping ferman 's case will hit a dead-end road in brussels .
the state department called on the belgium government to drop the case .
" we are pleased that the belgian government has taken action to change the law , " state department spokesman richard bouchar said on wednesday .
" but we believe the belgian government needs to be diligent in taking steps to prevent abuse of the legal system for political ends .
as to the specific case , we believe it does show the danger of a judicial system that 's open to politically motivated charges . "
still , ferman is intent on taking his chances .
he told journalists he had filed the case in belgium because it was not possible to go to the international criminal court , since the united states is not a member .
only one case has been brought to court since the 1993 law was enacted .
four rwandans were found guilty of involvement in the 1994 genocide in the african country and were sentenced to up to 15 years in prison in june 2001 .

in a major test to recent changes in belgium 's anti-genocide law , which allows foreign cases to be tried in brussels , a lawyer has filed a war crimes case on behalf of baghdad residents against two u.s. military leaders . in a development that could further complicate ties between belgium and the united states , a group of 19 iraqi civilians filed a war crimes lawsuit on wednesday against gen. tommy franks , commander of the u.s. troops in the war against iraq , and col. brian mccoy .
the suit was filed by human rights attorney jan fermon , who is a candidate for a parliament as a member of an obscure left-wing party in sunday 's national elections in belgium . it is made possible by a controversial belgian law that allows the country 's courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , regardless of where the crimes occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
" this is no symbolic action , " fermon told reporters as he filed the papers with prosecutors in brussels .
" my mandates want an independent investigation of the events . "

the plaintiffs include the jordanian father and wife of an al-jazeera journalist killed when the arab broadcaster 's office was bombed , along with 17 baghdad residents affected by 17 alleged incidents , including attacks on ambulances , attacks with cluster bombs as well as the bombing of a crowded marketplace -lrb- photo -rrb- .

a trade dispute is threatening to sour transatlantic relations , after the united states announced plans to sue the europe union unless it opens its market to millions of dollars of genetically modified goods . the united states said on tuesday it intends to file a complaint against the european union with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- over the eu ’ s five-year ban on importing new genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- . " the eu 's moratorium violates wto rules , " said u.s. trade representative robert zoellick at a press conference in washington .
he said that the eu 's blocking tactics prevented the development of the technology which could help farmers and consumers throughout the world .
the eu has authorized no new gmos for release since october 1998 . " we 've waited patiently for five years for the eu to follow the wto rules , " zoellick said .
" for five years , we 've been told by european officials that a change in policy is just around the corner .
but around every corner we find a new roadblock . " strained transatlantic ties the current dispute follows spats between the united states and the european union over uranium and corporate tax breaks , as well as trade in steel , bananas and beef .
it also comes just as america and europe are attempting to smooth over relations after a nasty rift opened due to the war in iraq . but zoellick was quick to dismiss speculation that the trade row could exacerbate the situtation .
" the u.s. and the eu have a large and important economic relationship , and disputes such as this , while very important , make up only one part of that relationship . "
he said the u.s. would continue to work with the eu to manage their disputes " in an appropriate way " . argentina , canada , and egypt have joined the u.s. in filing the wto case , which is also being supported by australia , chile , colombia , el salvador , honduras , mexico , new zealand , peru and uruguay .
the filing of the u.s.-led case triggers two months of talks between washington and brussels .
if these fail , zoellick said the u.s. would formally lodge its complaint , thereby starting a wto investigation which could take about 18 months . zoellick said scientific evidence showed that the european concerns were unjustified and that gmos should be allowed in just like any other product .
" people around the world have been eating biotech food for years . "
according to the reuters news agency , the trade dispute costs u.s. farmers about $ 300 million -lrb- € 260 million -rrb- a year in mostly lost corn sales . biotech crops are designed to better withstand insects and herbicides , but some critics fear they could be dangerous to both human health and the environment . europe says case is " unwarranted " the european commission in a statement said it regretted the u.s. decision to file the wto case .

but visitors have been fascinated by the work in progress there this week .
fifteen of the country 's top cartoonists are attempting to create the world 's longest cartoon strip over 90m of white hoarding .
from boadicea getting clamped to aliens pondering the function of a crumpled millennium dome , the " history " of london is portrayed in waterproof black marker pen .
the cartoons have to tell a consecutive story if they are to meet the guinness book of records ' requirements .
they were certainly drawing a crowd of people to see a different view of london 's history .
comic timing - you ca n't beat the weather for it cartoonist hack marcel jansma was escorting a group of dutch students who had just asked whether that was napoleon on nelson 's column .
" it 's too bad it 's not finished because we could take our students past it and do a history lesson in one walk , " he said .
others were less certain about its historical accuracy .
festival manager mick bateman who brought the plan to life with the help of london 's poet laureate martin rowson , said : " it can be very confusing for tourists , who will be going home with a completely different idea of british history . "
the cartoonists are racing against the clock and the weather to complete the strip by 1830 bst on wednesday .
tea towels are on standby to dry off the boards , although the pens are waterproof , they will not make a mark if the " canvas " is wet .
pupils on school trips watched the artists at work but the artists themselves did not seem to be put off by the showers .
" comic timing - you ca n't beat the weather for it , " said cartoonist matt buck , professionally known as hack .
" cartooning can be quite lonely - you tend to be locked in your office trying to be funny and you can go a little mad so it 's quite nice to see people laugh at your cartoons . "
guardian cartoonist nicola jennings found the glare from the boards so bright she had to wear sun glasses while drawing the great fire of london .
" i thought i 'd stay away from livingstone and the congestion charge , " she said .
some tourist confusion " a friend 's coming down with a brolly to stand over me . "
those artists who could not make it in person have faxed through designs to be recreated by john byrne and his team .
" it is the closest we will get to the national gallery , " he joked .
much of london 's history had a contemporary feel some tourists had difficulty understanding the satire , or the more contemporary references .
french teacher peroud jacques was admiring the millennium dome piece by hellman , but was confused by the sponsorship banner for hm prison service above it .
" as a frenchman i have got to think about it for a second time before i get it , " he said .
he added : " i like this sort of english humour , it is a bit lighter - not aggressive . "
the boards will eventually be auctioned off for great ormond street children 's hospital on the london comedy festival 's website .

pupils on school trips watched the artists at work but the artists themselves did not seem to be put off by the showers .
" comic timing - you ca n't beat the weather for it , " said cartoonist matt buck , professionally known as hack .
" cartooning can be quite lonely - you tend to be locked in your office trying to be funny and you can go a little mad so it 's quite nice to see people laugh at your cartoons . "
guardian cartoonist nicola jennings found the glare from the boards so bright she had to wear sun glasses while drawing the great fire of london .
" i thought i 'd stay away from livingstone and the congestion charge , " she said .
some tourist confusion " a friend 's coming down with a brolly to stand over me . "
those artists who could not make it in person have faxed through designs to be recreated by john byrne and his team .
" it is the closest we will get to the national gallery , " he joked .
much of london 's history had a contemporary feel some tourists had difficulty understanding the satire , or the more contemporary references .
french teacher peroud jacques was admiring the millennium dome piece by hellman , but was confused by the sponsorship banner for hm prison service above it .
" as a frenchman i have got to think about it for a second time before i get it , " he said .
he added : " i like this sort of english humour , it is a bit lighter - not aggressive . "
the boards will eventually be auctioned off for great ormond street children 's hospital on the london comedy festival 's website .

a very large number of elderly women are widows one estimate is that by the year 2050 , asia will be home to almost two-thirds of the world 's population of people over 60 and many will age in poverty .
due to longer life expectancies and falling birth rates , asia is rapidly getting older .
in many parts of the region the concepts of retirement and pensions barely exist .
in india , for example , less than 10 % of the population are covered by formal pension schemes and they are mostly government workers and professionals .
the government introduced a national old age pension scheme in the mid 1990s , which gives a handout of $ 1.50 a month .
it is designed as a safety net for those below the poverty line .
illiterate but a current study by helpage international has found that only about one in five of those eligible for the payments actually receive them .
many do not realise the scheme exists or , given that three out of four people over 60 in india today are illiterate , just can not cope with the paperwork .
the ageing population is putting pressure on limited resources " even if people are aware the scheme exists , they may have problems filling up the forms , getting their age certified by the doctor or getting certification that they are below the poverty line , " said shubha soneja , helpage india 's head of research and strategic development who is writing the report .
" our recommendation is that the government should simplify the procedures and involve non-government organisations a lot more . "
as a result of these gaps , most older people have few choices .
many are forced to carry on working for as long as they can to support themselves .
others become dependent on relatives , a pattern which can contribute to keeping the rest of the family in poverty .
sometimes the traditional three generation family unit is a positive model - but when the elderly have no alternative , dependence on family can leave them highly vulnerable to abuse - from physical and verbal to more generic problems such as isolation .
poverty one researcher cited the example in india of an elderly married couple forced to live separately because one son wanted just his mother to live with him to provide child care whilst a second son took her husband .
older people are now consistently poorer than the rest of the population and increasingly vulnerable and yet rarely targeted as a group by poverty alleviation programmes .
" older people are looked at as a spent force , " said shubha soneja , " and people do n't realise they 're adding to the dependent population . "
elderly people may never be able to stop working the lack of provision of health care for the elderly worsens the poverty cycle .
poorer older people are more likely to face health problems .
lost earnings through ill-health and the cost of medicines push them further into poverty .
gender inequality also plays a part and more than half of asia 's women over 60 are widows .
as well as losing any income generated by husbands , many widows also suffer low social status , are politically as well as economically marginalised and at increased risk of abuse .
inadequate as the number of elderly people starts to soar , the lack of financial planning is causing alarm - both about the plight of the elderly and the burden they will represent for communities already struggling against poverty .
shubha soneja says the indian government 's response so far to this looming crisis is inadequate .
india is already struggling to support a current population of about 81 million people over 60 .
by the year 2025 , that figure is expected to have more than doubled - to an estimated 177 million .
but plans to provide for them still are not being made .
" the figures are horrifying , " she says .
" unless we take steps now , it 's going to be a very pathetic situation . "

sce , maker of the popular playstation game console series , said its new handheld console would be called psp and extend playstation 's reach .
but the news wiped almost 10 % off shares in rival nintendo , until now the clear leader in the handheld game market .
sony shares rose 5 % on the news , as analysts suggested the group had made a strong move .
" while nintendo still holds the competitive edge in the market for portable games , it is safe to assume that this move by sony will eat into nintendo 's profits down the road , " said makoto suzuki , a senior fund manager at chuo mitsui asset management .
playing fair sony insisted its intention was to widen the portable games sector as a whole . "
they 're going to try to source as much as they can from sony , so it 's definitely going to be positive for the sony parent company " richard chu , ing securities " it is not that we want to face off with nintendo .
" what we foresee is that , with other firms in the same market , we hope to expand the game market itself by offering a variety of products , " an sce spokesman said .
analysts were nonetheless downbeat about the consequences for nintendo , whose popular game boy series has until now been virtually unchallenged .
" this could be a big worry , " said takeshi tajima , an analyst at bnp paribas .
mr tajima suggested nintendo could become vulnerable to a price war if it loses its status as the market leader .
" that could depress nintendo 's earnings , " said mr tajima .
sony boost sony , meanwhile , looks set to receive a welcome boost from the move .
the group said psp would feature a backlit , thin-film transistor liquid crystal display that can show dvd quality images .
specific details of psp 's release and pricing are to be disclosed later but analysts were already factoring in a healthy boost for a number of sony divisions .
" they 're going to try to source as much as they can from sony - liquid crystal displays and so forth - so it 's definitely going to be positive for the sony parent company , " said richard chu , an analyst at ing securities .
the lift comes at a good time .
last month , sony revealed it had lost 111bn yen -lrb- £ 579m ; $ 923m -rrb- in the first three months of 2003 .
this was almost 20 times the loss for the same period last year .
