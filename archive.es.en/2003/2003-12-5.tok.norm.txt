the haul discovered in the state of north rhine-westphalia in november proved to be one of the largest ever , more than the total picked up over the course of an average year .
" something did n't smell quite right , " said customs spokesperson harry brandt , explaining how the odor from cartons containing 177kg of caviar at the köln / bonn airport last month alerted officials to their biggest single haul .
" fresh caviar smells like the sea , as soon as it starts to smell like fish something is wrong , " he said .
the sturgeon fish , which produces caviar eggs or roe , is protected under the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora .
trade in caviar from former soviet states and countries around the caspian sea is strictly regulated . more briefs 26.11.2003 -pipe- vw executive denies job change rumors 26.11.2003 -pipe- u.s. troops likely to leave germany 26.11.2003 -pipe- cdu : no second chance for hohmann 26.11.2003 -pipe- world ’ s oldest food store discovered 24.11.2003 -pipe- shevardnadze says he wants to stay in georgia 24.11.2003 -pipe- german president tours latin america 21.11.2003 -pipe- ecumenical memorial service for istanbul bombings victims 21.11.2003 -pipe- german interior minister : mention muslim heritage in eu constitution radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

eu transportation ministers on friday discussed setting eu-wide rules for banning commercial trucks on europe ’ s highways on sundays .
germany and france fear newly harmonized regulations could weaken the ban . currently big commercial trucks are banned from germany ’ s roads on sundays and on saturdays during the summer .
although several other eu nations also have bans in place , the times and policies vary considerably . the european commission has for years pushed for common rules to be established .
officials in brussels are concerned that different policies create imbalances in the eu ’ s internal market and hinder the free transport of goods .
but germany ’ s deputy transportation minister ralf nagel on friday made clear that berlin would oppose the measure at all cost . “ we will never agree to a europe-wide regulation in this matter , ” nagel said in brussels according to the associated press .
“ this isn ’ t just any old matter , rather it ’ s an important question of national interest . ” berlin fears a new eu-wide policy will water down its own strict rules regulating heavy truck traffic on the weekends .
since germany will be at the heart of a expanded eu , berlin is concerned that heavy truck traffic will surge in coming years , endangering road safety and the environment . pressure on luxembourg however , in order to torpedo brussels plans , germany will have to convince some other countries to join in opposing the initiative .
currently only france and austria are also against the eu regulation of commercial truck traffic .
berlin and the other countries opposed have put pressure on tiny luxembourg to help them achieve the necessary blocking minority in the eu council of ministers . georg posaner , a spokesman for the austrian delegation , said late friday that luxembourg would back their position in brussels .
but there was no decision whether the eu presidency , currently represented by italy , would put the matter to a vote at the ministers ’ meeting or whether it would be postponed . currently in germany , heavy commercial trucks are banned from the roads from midnight to 10 p.m. on sundays all year and during the summer months also from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
saturdays .
austria , france , greece , italy , luxembourg and spain also all have some sort of ban on sundays . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shipping companies put brakes on toll system as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- left -rrb- said he didn ’ t share washington ’ s concerns .
" we will need to cooperate on a european level , " he said .

the plans , which failed to garner opposition support earlier this year , are intended to regulate immigration .
they propose measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . the government coalition of social democrats and greens views immigration as a crucial tool to counter germany ’ s aging and declining population , which is expected to pose serious problems for the country ’ s social welfare systems and labor market in the coming decades .

a decade later , the 1952 immigration and nationality act targeted communists as unworthy of pledging their allegiance to the american flag . still , the united states takes in about 1.5 million immigrants each year , according to the washington-based center for immigration studies .

that meant that despite living 20 years in the country and raising children , an entire family could still be considered foreign .

the plans , which failed to garner opposition support earlier this year , are intended to regulate immigration .
they propose measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . the government coalition of social democrats and greens views immigration as a crucial tool to counter germany ’ s aging and declining population , which is expected to pose serious problems for the country ’ s social welfare systems and labor market in the coming decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every third german will be 60 or older by 2050 . while generally supportive of a new immigration law , leaders of the conservative opposition christian democrat union reject large portions of the proposal .
they say germany ’ s labor market can not handle more immigrants at the same time the country is struggling to deal with high unemployment rates . although heated debates surround the current proposals , most german politicians agree that immigration is necessary for the country ’ s future .
what lessons , then , can germany draw from the united states , which built itself on the fruits of immigrant labor and initiative ? u.s. a land of immigrants since its beginnings , the united states has been referred to as a melting pot .
it is a land of immigrants , who , with a trace of pride , still call themselves african-americans , irish-americans , italian-americans and german-americans generations after their ancestors first set foot on american soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-americans proudly display their heritage during the annual steuben parade in new york .
while many identify with their ethnic roots , they often see themselves first and foremost as americans .
this says a lot about the positive light in which immigration is perceived in the united states , despite some dark spots in u.s. immigration history . the 1882 chinese exclusion act , for example , barred chinese nationals from becoming u.s. citizens and was not repealed until 1943 .
a decade later , the 1952 immigration and nationality act targeted communists as unworthy of pledging their allegiance to the american flag . still , the united states takes in about 1.5 million immigrants each year , according to the washington-based center for immigration studies .
by comparison , 220,000 people have entered germany on average each year over the last decade , about half of the u.s. number when the population size of both countries is considered . immigrants in germany still struggling to fit in for the past 30 to 40 years , germany and immigrants who have moved here have been asking the question : what role will immigrants play in german society and will there be a kind of integration possible as is often pointed to in the united states ? workers from turkey and yugoslavia , who were brought to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii , have long struggled to obtain german citizenship without relinquishing their original nationalities . while most countries , including the u.s. , grant citizenship to anyone born on their territory , german citizenship was based on german descent until a few years ago .
that meant that despite living 20 years in the country and raising children , an entire family could still be considered foreign .
the law was changed to grant citizenship to children born to parents who had been living legally in the country for at least eight years . progress , despite a low level of tolerance germany has progressed , according to cem özdemir , a german of turkish origin and a former member of parliament for the green party .
still , he ’ s often dismayed by what he calls a “ low level of tolerance ” in german society . whereas in the united states immigration is seen as something positive , in germany it is often viewed rather negatively , he told dw-radio .
germany can learn a lot from the united states on the issue of integration of people with different ethnic backgrounds , özdemir added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost a third of the people living in berlin 's kreuzberg district are foreigners .
“ we should also try to achieve a color blind society where it is not important where your parents came from , but it is important what you try to contribute to the country in which you live , ” said özdemir , who is a candidate in the 2004 eu parliamentary elections . can the u.s. learn from the european experience ? on the other hand , germany ’ s experience with european integration and swelling immigrant communities from africa , asia , india and russia may rapidly be bringing about such change . vangala ram , a u.s. diplomat in germany , is convinced that the united states also has a few things to learn . “ i think it is a very interesting time to be in europe as an american , ” ram said . ” we can see clearly that a community of 25 nations is developing , although they have different languages and different living standards .
that ’ s clearly something that would interest us as americans . ” if the tables have begun to turn in germany , there has also been a change of attitudes in the u.s. after the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the u.s. position on immigration became less welcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american students demonstrate their support for muslim and arab immigrants after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks .
u.s. citizens began to see immigration as a threat to national security .
measures taken since 2001 have indeed made life more difficult for immigrants , particularly for those coming from the middle east .
but ram said he is hopeful that the country ’ s tendency to be a home to immigrants will not decline . the u.s. will have to try to replicate the kind of assimilation of immigrants achieved in the 19th and 20th centuries , although the ethnic and religious diversity of immigrants has increased .
“ we ’ ve done that in the past and i am very optimistic that we are going to be able to do that in the future , ” ram said . devora rogers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them .

sharansky said on friday that the willingness of the european union to actually carry out such a study shows that anti-semitism and actual physical attacks on jews is a real problem and is one that europe takes very seriously .
the extent of this problem , according to sharansky , was evident in the reluctance of the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- to publish the report immediately .
the eumc withheld the publication of the report for a number of weeks , prompting the israeli minister to ask why an eu authority orders a study and then does not publish it .
“ the europeans must seriously ask themselves this question .
it is something someone really should look into , ” sharansky said . dw-world.de eu ’ s anti-semitism study dogged by controversy more briefs 05.12.2003 -pipe- privacy law proposals conjure ghosts of germany ’ s past 05.12.2003 -pipe- powell praises u.s.-german relations 05.12.2003 -pipe- a " bitter decision " for plutonium plant export to china 04.12.2003 -pipe- € 17 million lottery jackpot cracked 04.12.2003 -pipe- detectives advocate drop out program for islamists 03.12.2003 -pipe- german police arrest key iraqi terrorist in munich 03.12.2003 -pipe- german president pardons former raf terrorist 03.12.2003 -pipe- poor marks again for german school education radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

there are " sometimes situations when one has to make bitter decisions , " fischer said on thursday .

he said that as an opponent of nuclear power he did n't think much of the plans to export the plant .

but fischer told reporters that the transaction was still being examined .

there are " sometimes situations when one has to make bitter decisions , " fischer said on thursday .
fischer stressed that in assessing the chinese request it was essential to establish that military use of the facility would be impossible .
he said that as an opponent of nuclear power he did n't think much of the plans to export the plant .
to the outrage of many of fischer 's green party colleagues , the handelsblatt newspaper reported on thursday that the foreign minister had already given the export a green light in october .
but fischer told reporters that the transaction was still being examined .
during his visit to china , chancellor gerhard schröder said on tuesday said that he didn ’ t see any reasons why it could not happen . dw-world.de schröder calls for end to arms embargo against china german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .

education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .

in the wake of a dismal showing in an international survey of students ’ education , germany moves to introduce standardized curriculums and testing in each of the country ’ s schools . describe the theory of pythagoras .

you could call it the 1 + 1 = 2 of learning , but the members of germany ’ s top education regulator call it " education standards . "
on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .
the standing committee has already agreed on standardized curriculums for german , mathematics and a student ’ s first foreign language , and they are slated to take effect with the start of the 2004-2005 school year .

in the past the netherlands has repeatedly criticized france and germany for breaking discipline required by the euro zone ’ s stability and growth pact .
but now it looks like the dutch might break those rules themselves next year .
the cpb survey projects that the dutch budget deficit will hit 3.25 percent of gdp in 2004 - above the three percent ceiling allowed by the stability pact rules . the dutch finance minister has strongly dismissed the projections .
a statement issued by the ministry said that the idea that the netherlands was about to break the rules was " nonsense . "
a european commission spokesman also said that the commission did not expect the netherlands to breach the rules .

sharansky said on friday that the willingness of the european union to actually carry out such a study shows that anti-semitism and actual physical attacks on jews is a real problem and is one that europe takes very seriously .
the extent of this problem , according to sharansky , was evident in the reluctance of the eu ’ s monitoring center on racism and xenophobia -lrb- eumc -rrb- to publish the report immediately .
the eumc withheld the publication of the report for a number of weeks , prompting the israeli minister to ask why an eu authority orders a study and then does not publish it .

the draw for the qualification stages of the world cup 2006 took place in germany on friday with countries from around the globe hoping for smooth routes to the finals .
europe ’ s top teams , however , had no such luck . frankfurt became the focus of the soccer world on friday when the qualification groups for the world cup 2006 in germany were drawn out of the hat in a ceremony in the city ’ s festhalle .
the draw , which placed the world ’ s teams in separate regional contests , threw up some enthralling games with much fancied european sides such as england , france and italy facing the prospect of difficult games against stiff opposition . a total of 198 countries were represented at the lavish affair which also boasted dignitaries from the global game ’ s governing bodies from europe , asia , africa , oceania , south america and concacaf -lrb- north / central america and the caribbean -rrb- boosting the attendance to almost 3,500 guests . the germans , with their plans for the soccer extravaganza already well underway , sat back with pride and without pressure as the large majority of the other contenders awaited the draw that would place them in groups with the chance to be among the 32 finalists competing in germany and maybe one of the two teams to contest the golden trophy in berlin on july 9 , 2006 . germany already qualify as hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer and pele have been here before .
germany as hosts are automatically installed as one of the finalists but for the first time ever , the current holders , brazil , will have to qualify through the group stages .
their federation has already held their qualification draw and the group stage , devised as a league format , has already begun in south america . unlike the south americans , the european teams were divided into three groups of seven and five groups of six , with each team playing their group opponents both home and away over the course of the qualification stage . the top side in each group will qualify for the finals automatically along with the two best-placed runners-up .
the other six second-placed teams will then be paired off to play each other over two-legged play-offs for the remaining three places . celebrity hosts make european draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierluigi collina despite the fact that the host country was not involved , the selection process was an exciting one for the germans as a number of potentially dramatic clashes were picked out in the european association ’ s draw by six-time formula one world champion michael schumacher and the highly respected italian referee pierluigi collina -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was in charge of the 2002 world cup final .
germany coach rudi völler watched with interest as a number of his european counterparts were drawn against tricky opponents . top europeans face tough groups the top seeds in the uefa group - england , france , portugal , sweden , the czech republic , spain , italy and turkey - were all separated but that didn ’ t mean that they would all avoid difficult challenges .
england face local rivalries against wales and northern ireland while italy take on berti vogts ’ scotland and the difficult norwegians .
former champions france will also face heavy resistance in their visits to the republic of ireland and switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hope to celebrate again at the next world cup .
turkey , third placed at japan / korea in 2002 , will have problems against the hard-to-beat danes and will face logistical as well as tactical headaches against old foes greece .
the czech republic will have to repeat their euro 2004 exploits against the dutch while portugal , sweden and spain will spend their qualification games laboring against awkward eastern european sides . african stars breathe easy the seeded african teams - which are hoping to fulfill brazilian legend pele ’ s prophecy that a nation from the continent will soon win the ultimate trophy - were also separated in their draw with cameroon , nigeria , south africa and senegal , france ’ s tormentors at last year ’ s competition , all destined to face lower opposition in the group stage . in the oceania group , favorites australia and their south pacific neighbors new zealand get a free ride into the second round of their qualification phase , a helping hand that could see the socceroos once again reach the play-off stages against one of the winners from the south america , asia or concacaf groups . long way to go for holders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have to qualify to defend their title this time .
the south american teams pushing for their own final spots in their qualification league are currently paraguay in first position , argentina and brazil in third after four games with 14 more to go . stange eyes german homecoming with iraq in the concacaf group , the united states , one of the favorites and world cup quarter-finalists in 2002 , will play the winner of the granada vs. guyana game in the second phase .
in the asian qualification stage , the iraqi team , coached by german bernd stange , will play palestine , china and uzbekistan for a place in the finals . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to face old foes in euro 2004 old scores and local rivalries are set to be settled in the opening stages of the european championships in portugal next summer as the soccer teams of germany and holland have been placed together in group d.

the draw for the qualification stages of the world cup 2006 took place in germany on friday with countries from around the globe hoping for smooth routes to the finals .

eu transportation ministers on friday discussed setting eu-wide rules for banning commercial trucks on europe ’ s highways on sundays .
germany and france fear newly harmonized regulations could weaken the ban . currently big commercial trucks are banned from germany ’ s roads on sundays and on saturdays during the summer .
although several other eu nations also have bans in place , the times and policies vary considerably . the european commission has for years pushed for common rules to be established .
officials in brussels are concerned that different policies create imbalances in the eu ’ s internal market and hinder the free transport of goods .
but germany ’ s deputy transportation minister ralf nagel on friday made clear that berlin would oppose the measure at all cost . “ we will never agree to a europe-wide regulation in this matter , ” nagel said in brussels according to the associated press .
“ this isn ’ t just any old matter , rather it ’ s an important question of national interest . ” berlin fears a new eu-wide policy will water down its own strict rules regulating heavy truck traffic on the weekends .
since germany will be at the heart of a expanded eu , berlin is concerned that heavy truck traffic will surge in coming years , endangering road safety and the environment . pressure on luxembourg however , in order to torpedo brussels plans , germany will have to convince some other countries to join in opposing the initiative .
currently only france and austria are also against the eu regulation of commercial truck traffic .
berlin and the other countries opposed have put pressure on tiny luxembourg to help them achieve the necessary blocking minority in the eu council of ministers . georg posaner , a spokesman for the austrian delegation , said late friday that luxembourg would back their position in brussels .
but there was no decision whether the eu presidency , currently represented by italy , would put the matter to a vote at the ministers ’ meeting or whether it would be postponed . currently in germany , heavy commercial trucks are banned from the roads from midnight to 10 p.m. on sundays all year and during the summer months also from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
saturdays .
austria , france , greece , italy , luxembourg and spain also all have some sort of ban on sundays . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shipping companies put brakes on toll system as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott .

you could call it the 1 + 1 = 2 of learning , but the members of germany ’ s top education regulator call it " education standards . "
on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .
the standing committee has already agreed on standardized curriculums for german , mathematics and a student ’ s first foreign language , and they are slated to take effect with the start of the 2004-2005 school year .

in the wake of a dismal showing in an international survey of students ’ education , germany moves to introduce standardized curriculums and testing in each of the country ’ s schools . describe the theory of pythagoras .
calculate the surface of a trapezoid .
say two related sentences about your favorite food in a foreign language .
you could call it the 1 + 1 = 2 of learning , but the members of germany ’ s top education regulator call it " education standards . "
on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .
the standing committee has already agreed on standardized curriculums for german , mathematics and a student ’ s first foreign language , and they are slated to take effect with the start of the 2004-2005 school year .
standards for other subjects will follow soon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report lambastes german schools the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints .

the plans , which failed to garner opposition support earlier this year , are intended to regulate immigration .

a decade later , the 1952 immigration and nationality act targeted communists as unworthy of pledging their allegiance to the american flag . still , the united states takes in about 1.5 million immigrants each year , according to the washington-based center for immigration studies .

the law was changed to grant citizenship to children born to parents who had been living legally in the country for at least eight years . progress , despite a low level of tolerance germany has progressed , according to cem özdemir , a german of turkish origin and a former member of parliament for the green party .
still , he ’ s often dismayed by what he calls a “ low level of tolerance ” in german society . whereas in the united states immigration is seen as something positive , in germany it is often viewed rather negatively , he told dw-radio .
germany can learn a lot from the united states on the issue of integration of people with different ethnic backgrounds , özdemir added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost a third of the people living in berlin 's kreuzberg district are foreigners .
“ we should also try to achieve a color blind society where it is not important where your parents came from , but it is important what you try to contribute to the country in which you live , ” said özdemir , who is a candidate in the 2004 eu parliamentary elections . can the u.s. learn from the european experience ? on the other hand , germany ’ s experience with european integration and swelling immigrant communities from africa , asia , india and russia may rapidly be bringing about such change . vangala ram , a u.s. diplomat in germany , is convinced that the united states also has a few things to learn . “ i think it is a very interesting time to be in europe as an american , ” ram said . ” we can see clearly that a community of 25 nations is developing , although they have different languages and different living standards .

u.s. citizens began to see immigration as a threat to national security .
measures taken since 2001 have indeed made life more difficult for immigrants , particularly for those coming from the middle east .
but ram said he is hopeful that the country ’ s tendency to be a home to immigrants will not decline . the u.s. will have to try to replicate the kind of assimilation of immigrants achieved in the 19th and 20th centuries , although the ethnic and religious diversity of immigrants has increased .

the draw for the qualification stages of the world cup 2006 took place in germany on friday with countries from around the globe hoping for smooth routes to the finals .
europe ’ s top teams , however , had no such luck . frankfurt became the focus of the soccer world on friday when the qualification groups for the world cup 2006 in germany were drawn out of the hat in a ceremony in the city ’ s festhalle .
the draw , which placed the world ’ s teams in separate regional contests , threw up some enthralling games with much fancied european sides such as england , france and italy facing the prospect of difficult games against stiff opposition . a total of 198 countries were represented at the lavish affair which also boasted dignitaries from the global game ’ s governing bodies from europe , asia , africa , oceania , south america and concacaf -lrb- north / central america and the caribbean -rrb- boosting the attendance to almost 3,500 guests . the germans , with their plans for the soccer extravaganza already well underway , sat back with pride and without pressure as the large majority of the other contenders awaited the draw that would place them in groups with the chance to be among the 32 finalists competing in germany and maybe one of the two teams to contest the golden trophy in berlin on july 9 , 2006 . germany already qualify as hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer and pele have been here before .
germany as hosts are automatically installed as one of the finalists but for the first time ever , the current holders , brazil , will have to qualify through the group stages .
their federation has already held their qualification draw and the group stage , devised as a league format , has already begun in south america . unlike the south americans , the european teams were divided into three groups of seven and five groups of six , with each team playing their group opponents both home and away over the course of the qualification stage . the top side in each group will qualify for the finals automatically along with the two best-placed runners-up .
the other six second-placed teams will then be paired off to play each other over two-legged play-offs for the remaining three places . celebrity hosts make european draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierluigi collina despite the fact that the host country was not involved , the selection process was an exciting one for the germans as a number of potentially dramatic clashes were picked out in the european association ’ s draw by six-time formula one world champion michael schumacher and the highly respected italian referee pierluigi collina -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was in charge of the 2002 world cup final .
germany coach rudi völler watched with interest as a number of his european counterparts were drawn against tricky opponents . top europeans face tough groups the top seeds in the uefa group - england , france , portugal , sweden , the czech republic , spain , italy and turkey - were all separated but that didn ’ t mean that they would all avoid difficult challenges .
england face local rivalries against wales and northern ireland while italy take on berti vogts ’ scotland and the difficult norwegians .
former champions france will also face heavy resistance in their visits to the republic of ireland and switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hope to celebrate again at the next world cup .
turkey , third placed at japan / korea in 2002 , will have problems against the hard-to-beat danes and will face logistical as well as tactical headaches against old foes greece .
the czech republic will have to repeat their euro 2004 exploits against the dutch while portugal , sweden and spain will spend their qualification games laboring against awkward eastern european sides . african stars breathe easy the seeded african teams - which are hoping to fulfill brazilian legend pele ’ s prophecy that a nation from the continent will soon win the ultimate trophy - were also separated in their draw with cameroon , nigeria , south africa and senegal , france ’ s tormentors at last year ’ s competition , all destined to face lower opposition in the group stage . in the oceania group , favorites australia and their south pacific neighbors new zealand get a free ride into the second round of their qualification phase , a helping hand that could see the socceroos once again reach the play-off stages against one of the winners from the south america , asia or concacaf groups . long way to go for holders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have to qualify to defend their title this time .
the south american teams pushing for their own final spots in their qualification league are currently paraguay in first position , argentina and brazil in third after four games with 14 more to go . stange eyes german homecoming with iraq in the concacaf group , the united states , one of the favorites and world cup quarter-finalists in 2002 , will play the winner of the granada vs. guyana game in the second phase .

“ we hope that in 2005 , we will finally reach the bottom of the valley , ” said bvb head heinz-werner bonjean . he estimated that 160,000 jobs were lost in the construction industry this year , and said another 74,000 could be axed in 2004 . but the bvb said there are hopes for recovery , not least because germans have applied for an unusually high number of building permits in order to capitalise on government subsidies for home-builders before those funds are cut . more briefs 05.12.2003 -pipe- software ag seeks solutions in india 05.12.2003 -pipe- bayer opens new chemical factory 04.12.2003 -pipe- budget airlines to start lobbying group 04.12.2003 -pipe- schröder pushes for greater trade with kazakhstan 04.12.2003 -pipe- finance minister : germany to lower deficit by 2005 04.12.2003 -pipe- november unemployment rate falls in germany 03.12.2003 -pipe- bertelsmann expands book sales in china 03.12.2003 -pipe- germans worry chinese will acquire transrapid know-how 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .

education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .
the standing committee has already agreed on standardized curriculums for german , mathematics and a student ’ s first foreign language , and they are slated to take effect with the start of the 2004-2005 school year .
standards for other subjects will follow soon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report lambastes german schools the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- left -rrb- said he didn ’ t share washington ’ s concerns .

eu transportation ministers on friday discussed setting eu-wide rules for banning commercial trucks on europe ’ s highways on sundays .
germany and france fear newly harmonized regulations could weaken the ban . currently big commercial trucks are banned from germany ’ s roads on sundays and on saturdays during the summer .
although several other eu nations also have bans in place , the times and policies vary considerably . the european commission has for years pushed for common rules to be established .
officials in brussels are concerned that different policies create imbalances in the eu ’ s internal market and hinder the free transport of goods .
but germany ’ s deputy transportation minister ralf nagel on friday made clear that berlin would oppose the measure at all cost . “ we will never agree to a europe-wide regulation in this matter , ” nagel said in brussels according to the associated press .
“ this isn ’ t just any old matter , rather it ’ s an important question of national interest . ” berlin fears a new eu-wide policy will water down its own strict rules regulating heavy truck traffic on the weekends .
since germany will be at the heart of a expanded eu , berlin is concerned that heavy truck traffic will surge in coming years , endangering road safety and the environment . pressure on luxembourg however , in order to torpedo brussels plans , germany will have to convince some other countries to join in opposing the initiative .
currently only france and austria are also against the eu regulation of commercial truck traffic .
berlin and the other countries opposed have put pressure on tiny luxembourg to help them achieve the necessary blocking minority in the eu council of ministers . georg posaner , a spokesman for the austrian delegation , said late friday that luxembourg would back their position in brussels .
but there was no decision whether the eu presidency , currently represented by italy , would put the matter to a vote at the ministers ’ meeting or whether it would be postponed . currently in germany , heavy commercial trucks are banned from the roads from midnight to 10 p.m. on sundays all year and during the summer months also from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
saturdays .
austria , france , greece , italy , luxembourg and spain also all have some sort of ban on sundays . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shipping companies put brakes on toll system as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .

in the wake of a dismal showing in an international survey of students ’ education , germany moves to introduce standardized curriculums and testing in each of the country ’ s schools . describe the theory of pythagoras .
calculate the surface of a trapezoid .
say two related sentences about your favorite food in a foreign language .
you could call it the 1 + 1 = 2 of learning , but the members of germany ’ s top education regulator call it " education standards . "
on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .
the standing committee has already agreed on standardized curriculums for german , mathematics and a student ’ s first foreign language , and they are slated to take effect with the start of the 2004-2005 school year .
standards for other subjects will follow soon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report lambastes german schools the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints .

the plans , which failed to garner opposition support earlier this year , are intended to regulate immigration .
they propose measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . the government coalition of social democrats and greens views immigration as a crucial tool to counter germany ’ s aging and declining population , which is expected to pose serious problems for the country ’ s social welfare systems and labor market in the coming decades .

in the wake of a dismal showing in an international survey of students ’ education , germany moves to introduce standardized curriculums and testing in each of the country ’ s schools . describe the theory of pythagoras .
calculate the surface of a trapezoid .
say two related sentences about your favorite food in a foreign language .
you could call it the 1 + 1 = 2 of learning , but the members of germany ’ s top education regulator call it " education standards . "
on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .
the standing committee has already agreed on standardized curriculums for german , mathematics and a student ’ s first foreign language , and they are slated to take effect with the start of the 2004-2005 school year .
standards for other subjects will follow soon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report lambastes german schools the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- left -rrb- said he didn ’ t share washington ’ s concerns .
" we will need to cooperate on a european level , " he said .
in a separate interview with the financial times , fischer stressed that a militarily-stronger europe was good for nato .

" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- left -rrb- said he didn ’ t share washington ’ s concerns .
" we will need to cooperate on a european level , " he said .
in a separate interview with the financial times , fischer stressed that a militarily-stronger europe was good for nato .
" -lrb- european military involvement -rrb- in macedonia , serbia and montenegro has shown that an empowered europe is in the interest of nato .

in the wake of a dismal showing in an international survey of students ’ education , germany moves to introduce standardized curriculums and testing in each of the country ’ s schools . describe the theory of pythagoras .

say two related sentences about your favorite food in a foreign language .
you could call it the 1 + 1 = 2 of learning , but the members of germany ’ s top education regulator call it " education standards . "
on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .
the standing committee has already agreed on standardized curriculums for german , mathematics and a student ’ s first foreign language , and they are slated to take effect with the start of the 2004-2005 school year .

the plans , which failed to garner opposition support earlier this year , are intended to regulate immigration .
they propose measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . the government coalition of social democrats and greens views immigration as a crucial tool to counter germany ’ s aging and declining population , which is expected to pose serious problems for the country ’ s social welfare systems and labor market in the coming decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every third german will be 60 or older by 2050 . while generally supportive of a new immigration law , leaders of the conservative opposition christian democrat union reject large portions of the proposal .
they say germany ’ s labor market can not handle more immigrants at the same time the country is struggling to deal with high unemployment rates . although heated debates surround the current proposals , most german politicians agree that immigration is necessary for the country ’ s future .
what lessons , then , can germany draw from the united states , which built itself on the fruits of immigrant labor and initiative ? u.s. a land of immigrants since its beginnings , the united states has been referred to as a melting pot .
it is a land of immigrants , who , with a trace of pride , still call themselves african-americans , irish-americans , italian-americans and german-americans generations after their ancestors first set foot on american soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-americans proudly display their heritage during the annual steuben parade in new york .
while many identify with their ethnic roots , they often see themselves first and foremost as americans .
this says a lot about the positive light in which immigration is perceived in the united states , despite some dark spots in u.s. immigration history . the 1882 chinese exclusion act , for example , barred chinese nationals from becoming u.s. citizens and was not repealed until 1943 .
a decade later , the 1952 immigration and nationality act targeted communists as unworthy of pledging their allegiance to the american flag . still , the united states takes in about 1.5 million immigrants each year , according to the washington-based center for immigration studies .
by comparison , 220,000 people have entered germany on average each year over the last decade , about half of the u.s. number when the population size of both countries is considered . immigrants in germany still struggling to fit in for the past 30 to 40 years , germany and immigrants who have moved here have been asking the question : what role will immigrants play in german society and will there be a kind of integration possible as is often pointed to in the united states ? workers from turkey and yugoslavia , who were brought to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii , have long struggled to obtain german citizenship without relinquishing their original nationalities . while most countries , including the u.s. , grant citizenship to anyone born on their territory , german citizenship was based on german descent until a few years ago .
that meant that despite living 20 years in the country and raising children , an entire family could still be considered foreign .
the law was changed to grant citizenship to children born to parents who had been living legally in the country for at least eight years . progress , despite a low level of tolerance germany has progressed , according to cem özdemir , a german of turkish origin and a former member of parliament for the green party .
still , he ’ s often dismayed by what he calls a “ low level of tolerance ” in german society . whereas in the united states immigration is seen as something positive , in germany it is often viewed rather negatively , he told dw-radio .
germany can learn a lot from the united states on the issue of integration of people with different ethnic backgrounds , özdemir added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost a third of the people living in berlin 's kreuzberg district are foreigners .
“ we should also try to achieve a color blind society where it is not important where your parents came from , but it is important what you try to contribute to the country in which you live , ” said özdemir , who is a candidate in the 2004 eu parliamentary elections . can the u.s. learn from the european experience ? on the other hand , germany ’ s experience with european integration and swelling immigrant communities from africa , asia , india and russia may rapidly be bringing about such change . vangala ram , a u.s. diplomat in germany , is convinced that the united states also has a few things to learn . “ i think it is a very interesting time to be in europe as an american , ” ram said . ” we can see clearly that a community of 25 nations is developing , although they have different languages and different living standards .
that ’ s clearly something that would interest us as americans . ” if the tables have begun to turn in germany , there has also been a change of attitudes in the u.s. after the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the u.s. position on immigration became less welcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american students demonstrate their support for muslim and arab immigrants after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks .
u.s. citizens began to see immigration as a threat to national security .
measures taken since 2001 have indeed made life more difficult for immigrants , particularly for those coming from the middle east .
but ram said he is hopeful that the country ’ s tendency to be a home to immigrants will not decline . the u.s. will have to try to replicate the kind of assimilation of immigrants achieved in the 19th and 20th centuries , although the ethnic and religious diversity of immigrants has increased .
“ we ’ ve done that in the past and i am very optimistic that we are going to be able to do that in the future , ” ram said . devora rogers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : educating germany germans mull sweeping education reforms report lambastes german schools bad grades for german schools germany moves to all-day schools germany -pipe- 05.12.2003 germany to introduce federal school standards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , kids will march in step as they learn german , math and other subjects .
in the wake of a dismal showing in an international survey of students ’ education , germany moves to introduce standardized curriculums and testing in each of the country ’ s schools . describe the theory of pythagoras .
calculate the surface of a trapezoid .
say two related sentences about your favorite food in a foreign language .
you could call it the 1 + 1 = 2 of learning , but the members of germany ’ s top education regulator call it " education standards . "
on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .
the standing committee has already agreed on standardized curriculums for german , mathematics and a student ’ s first foreign language , and they are slated to take effect with the start of the 2004-2005 school year .
standards for other subjects will follow soon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report lambastes german schools the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints .

the draw for the qualification stages of the world cup 2006 took place in germany on friday with countries from around the globe hoping for smooth routes to the finals .
europe ’ s top teams , however , had no such luck . frankfurt became the focus of the soccer world on friday when the qualification groups for the world cup 2006 in germany were drawn out of the hat in a ceremony in the city ’ s festhalle .
the draw , which placed the world ’ s teams in separate regional contests , threw up some enthralling games with much fancied european sides such as england , france and italy facing the prospect of difficult games against stiff opposition . a total of 198 countries were represented at the lavish affair which also boasted dignitaries from the global game ’ s governing bodies from europe , asia , africa , oceania , south america and concacaf -lrb- north / central america and the caribbean -rrb- boosting the attendance to almost 3,500 guests . the germans , with their plans for the soccer extravaganza already well underway , sat back with pride and without pressure as the large majority of the other contenders awaited the draw that would place them in groups with the chance to be among the 32 finalists competing in germany and maybe one of the two teams to contest the golden trophy in berlin on july 9 , 2006 . germany already qualify as hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer and pele have been here before .
germany as hosts are automatically installed as one of the finalists but for the first time ever , the current holders , brazil , will have to qualify through the group stages .
their federation has already held their qualification draw and the group stage , devised as a league format , has already begun in south america . unlike the south americans , the european teams were divided into three groups of seven and five groups of six , with each team playing their group opponents both home and away over the course of the qualification stage . the top side in each group will qualify for the finals automatically along with the two best-placed runners-up .
the other six second-placed teams will then be paired off to play each other over two-legged play-offs for the remaining three places . celebrity hosts make european draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierluigi collina despite the fact that the host country was not involved , the selection process was an exciting one for the germans as a number of potentially dramatic clashes were picked out in the european association ’ s draw by six-time formula one world champion michael schumacher and the highly respected italian referee pierluigi collina -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was in charge of the 2002 world cup final .
germany coach rudi völler watched with interest as a number of his european counterparts were drawn against tricky opponents . top europeans face tough groups the top seeds in the uefa group - england , france , portugal , sweden , the czech republic , spain , italy and turkey - were all separated but that didn ’ t mean that they would all avoid difficult challenges .
england face local rivalries against wales and northern ireland while italy take on berti vogts ’ scotland and the difficult norwegians .
former champions france will also face heavy resistance in their visits to the republic of ireland and switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hope to celebrate again at the next world cup .
turkey , third placed at japan / korea in 2002 , will have problems against the hard-to-beat danes and will face logistical as well as tactical headaches against old foes greece .
the czech republic will have to repeat their euro 2004 exploits against the dutch while portugal , sweden and spain will spend their qualification games laboring against awkward eastern european sides . african stars breathe easy the seeded african teams - which are hoping to fulfill brazilian legend pele ’ s prophecy that a nation from the continent will soon win the ultimate trophy - were also separated in their draw with cameroon , nigeria , south africa and senegal , france ’ s tormentors at last year ’ s competition , all destined to face lower opposition in the group stage . in the oceania group , favorites australia and their south pacific neighbors new zealand get a free ride into the second round of their qualification phase , a helping hand that could see the socceroos once again reach the play-off stages against one of the winners from the south america , asia or concacaf groups . long way to go for holders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have to qualify to defend their title this time .
the south american teams pushing for their own final spots in their qualification league are currently paraguay in first position , argentina and brazil in third after four games with 14 more to go . stange eyes german homecoming with iraq in the concacaf group , the united states , one of the favorites and world cup quarter-finalists in 2002 , will play the winner of the granada vs. guyana game in the second phase .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- left -rrb- said he didn ’ t share washington ’ s concerns .
" we will need to cooperate on a european level , " he said .
in a separate interview with the financial times , fischer stressed that a militarily-stronger europe was good for nato .

the draw for the qualification stages of the world cup 2006 took place in germany on friday with countries from around the globe hoping for smooth routes to the finals .
europe ’ s top teams , however , had no such luck . frankfurt became the focus of the soccer world on friday when the qualification groups for the world cup 2006 in germany were drawn out of the hat in a ceremony in the city ’ s festhalle .
the draw , which placed the world ’ s teams in separate regional contests , threw up some enthralling games with much fancied european sides such as england , france and italy facing the prospect of difficult games against stiff opposition . a total of 198 countries were represented at the lavish affair which also boasted dignitaries from the global game ’ s governing bodies from europe , asia , africa , oceania , south america and concacaf -lrb- north / central america and the caribbean -rrb- boosting the attendance to almost 3,500 guests . the germans , with their plans for the soccer extravaganza already well underway , sat back with pride and without pressure as the large majority of the other contenders awaited the draw that would place them in groups with the chance to be among the 32 finalists competing in germany and maybe one of the two teams to contest the golden trophy in berlin on july 9 , 2006 . germany already qualify as hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer and pele have been here before .
germany as hosts are automatically installed as one of the finalists but for the first time ever , the current holders , brazil , will have to qualify through the group stages .
their federation has already held their qualification draw and the group stage , devised as a league format , has already begun in south america . unlike the south americans , the european teams were divided into three groups of seven and five groups of six , with each team playing their group opponents both home and away over the course of the qualification stage . the top side in each group will qualify for the finals automatically along with the two best-placed runners-up .
the other six second-placed teams will then be paired off to play each other over two-legged play-offs for the remaining three places . celebrity hosts make european draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierluigi collina despite the fact that the host country was not involved , the selection process was an exciting one for the germans as a number of potentially dramatic clashes were picked out in the european association ’ s draw by six-time formula one world champion michael schumacher and the highly respected italian referee pierluigi collina -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was in charge of the 2002 world cup final .
germany coach rudi völler watched with interest as a number of his european counterparts were drawn against tricky opponents . top europeans face tough groups the top seeds in the uefa group - england , france , portugal , sweden , the czech republic , spain , italy and turkey - were all separated but that didn ’ t mean that they would all avoid difficult challenges .
england face local rivalries against wales and northern ireland while italy take on berti vogts ’ scotland and the difficult norwegians .
former champions france will also face heavy resistance in their visits to the republic of ireland and switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hope to celebrate again at the next world cup .
turkey , third placed at japan / korea in 2002 , will have problems against the hard-to-beat danes and will face logistical as well as tactical headaches against old foes greece .
the czech republic will have to repeat their euro 2004 exploits against the dutch while portugal , sweden and spain will spend their qualification games laboring against awkward eastern european sides . african stars breathe easy the seeded african teams - which are hoping to fulfill brazilian legend pele ’ s prophecy that a nation from the continent will soon win the ultimate trophy - were also separated in their draw with cameroon , nigeria , south africa and senegal , france ’ s tormentors at last year ’ s competition , all destined to face lower opposition in the group stage . in the oceania group , favorites australia and their south pacific neighbors new zealand get a free ride into the second round of their qualification phase , a helping hand that could see the socceroos once again reach the play-off stages against one of the winners from the south america , asia or concacaf groups . long way to go for holders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have to qualify to defend their title this time .
the south american teams pushing for their own final spots in their qualification league are currently paraguay in first position , argentina and brazil in third after four games with 14 more to go . stange eyes german homecoming with iraq in the concacaf group , the united states , one of the favorites and world cup quarter-finalists in 2002 , will play the winner of the granada vs. guyana game in the second phase .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every third german will be 60 or older by 2050 . while generally supportive of a new immigration law , leaders of the conservative opposition christian democrat union reject large portions of the proposal .
they say germany ’ s labor market can not handle more immigrants at the same time the country is struggling to deal with high unemployment rates . although heated debates surround the current proposals , most german politicians agree that immigration is necessary for the country ’ s future .
what lessons , then , can germany draw from the united states , which built itself on the fruits of immigrant labor and initiative ? u.s. a land of immigrants since its beginnings , the united states has been referred to as a melting pot .
it is a land of immigrants , who , with a trace of pride , still call themselves african-americans , irish-americans , italian-americans and german-americans generations after their ancestors first set foot on american soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-americans proudly display their heritage during the annual steuben parade in new york .
while many identify with their ethnic roots , they often see themselves first and foremost as americans .
this says a lot about the positive light in which immigration is perceived in the united states , despite some dark spots in u.s. immigration history . the 1882 chinese exclusion act , for example , barred chinese nationals from becoming u.s. citizens and was not repealed until 1943 .
a decade later , the 1952 immigration and nationality act targeted communists as unworthy of pledging their allegiance to the american flag . still , the united states takes in about 1.5 million immigrants each year , according to the washington-based center for immigration studies .
by comparison , 220,000 people have entered germany on average each year over the last decade , about half of the u.s. number when the population size of both countries is considered . immigrants in germany still struggling to fit in for the past 30 to 40 years , germany and immigrants who have moved here have been asking the question : what role will immigrants play in german society and will there be a kind of integration possible as is often pointed to in the united states ? workers from turkey and yugoslavia , who were brought to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii , have long struggled to obtain german citizenship without relinquishing their original nationalities . while most countries , including the u.s. , grant citizenship to anyone born on their territory , german citizenship was based on german descent until a few years ago .
that meant that despite living 20 years in the country and raising children , an entire family could still be considered foreign .
the law was changed to grant citizenship to children born to parents who had been living legally in the country for at least eight years . progress , despite a low level of tolerance germany has progressed , according to cem özdemir , a german of turkish origin and a former member of parliament for the green party .
still , he ’ s often dismayed by what he calls a “ low level of tolerance ” in german society . whereas in the united states immigration is seen as something positive , in germany it is often viewed rather negatively , he told dw-radio .
germany can learn a lot from the united states on the issue of integration of people with different ethnic backgrounds , özdemir added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost a third of the people living in berlin 's kreuzberg district are foreigners .
“ we should also try to achieve a color blind society where it is not important where your parents came from , but it is important what you try to contribute to the country in which you live , ” said özdemir , who is a candidate in the 2004 eu parliamentary elections . can the u.s. learn from the european experience ? on the other hand , germany ’ s experience with european integration and swelling immigrant communities from africa , asia , india and russia may rapidly be bringing about such change . vangala ram , a u.s. diplomat in germany , is convinced that the united states also has a few things to learn . “ i think it is a very interesting time to be in europe as an american , ” ram said . ” we can see clearly that a community of 25 nations is developing , although they have different languages and different living standards .
that ’ s clearly something that would interest us as americans . ” if the tables have begun to turn in germany , there has also been a change of attitudes in the u.s. after the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the u.s. position on immigration became less welcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american students demonstrate their support for muslim and arab immigrants after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks .
u.s. citizens began to see immigration as a threat to national security .
measures taken since 2001 have indeed made life more difficult for immigrants , particularly for those coming from the middle east .
but ram said he is hopeful that the country ’ s tendency to be a home to immigrants will not decline . the u.s. will have to try to replicate the kind of assimilation of immigrants achieved in the 19th and 20th centuries , although the ethnic and religious diversity of immigrants has increased .
“ we ’ ve done that in the past and i am very optimistic that we are going to be able to do that in the future , ” ram said . devora rogers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law .

“ we hope that in 2005 , we will finally reach the bottom of the valley , ” said bvb head heinz-werner bonjean . he estimated that 160,000 jobs were lost in the construction industry this year , and said another 74,000 could be axed in 2004 . but the bvb said there are hopes for recovery , not least because germans have applied for an unusually high number of building permits in order to capitalise on government subsidies for home-builders before those funds are cut . more briefs 05.12.2003 -pipe- software ag seeks solutions in india 05.12.2003 -pipe- bayer opens new chemical factory 04.12.2003 -pipe- budget airlines to start lobbying group 04.12.2003 -pipe- schröder pushes for greater trade with kazakhstan 04.12.2003 -pipe- finance minister : germany to lower deficit by 2005 04.12.2003 -pipe- november unemployment rate falls in germany 03.12.2003 -pipe- bertelsmann expands book sales in china 03.12.2003 -pipe- germans worry chinese will acquire transrapid know-how 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in the wake of a dismal showing in an international survey of students ’ education , germany moves to introduce standardized curriculums and testing in each of the country ’ s schools . describe the theory of pythagoras .
calculate the surface of a trapezoid .
say two related sentences about your favorite food in a foreign language .
you could call it the 1 + 1 = 2 of learning , but the members of germany ’ s top education regulator call it " education standards . "
on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .
the standing committee has already agreed on standardized curriculums for german , mathematics and a student ’ s first foreign language , and they are slated to take effect with the start of the 2004-2005 school year .
standards for other subjects will follow soon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report lambastes german schools the first-ever nationwide education report for germany released friday has castigated the country ’ s “ fault-riddled school system ” and urged policymakers to make education a priority despite budgetary constraints .

the draw for the qualification stages of the world cup 2006 took place in germany on friday with countries from around the globe hoping for smooth routes to the finals .
europe ’ s top teams , however , had no such luck . frankfurt became the focus of the soccer world on friday when the qualification groups for the world cup 2006 in germany were drawn out of the hat in a ceremony in the city ’ s festhalle .
the draw , which placed the world ’ s teams in separate regional contests , threw up some enthralling games with much fancied european sides such as england , france and italy facing the prospect of difficult games against stiff opposition . a total of 198 countries were represented at the lavish affair which also boasted dignitaries from the global game ’ s governing bodies from europe , asia , africa , oceania , south america and concacaf -lrb- north / central america and the caribbean -rrb- boosting the attendance to almost 3,500 guests . the germans , with their plans for the soccer extravaganza already well underway , sat back with pride and without pressure as the large majority of the other contenders awaited the draw that would place them in groups with the chance to be among the 32 finalists competing in germany and maybe one of the two teams to contest the golden trophy in berlin on july 9 , 2006 . germany already qualify as hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer and pele have been here before .
germany as hosts are automatically installed as one of the finalists but for the first time ever , the current holders , brazil , will have to qualify through the group stages .
their federation has already held their qualification draw and the group stage , devised as a league format , has already begun in south america . unlike the south americans , the european teams were divided into three groups of seven and five groups of six , with each team playing their group opponents both home and away over the course of the qualification stage . the top side in each group will qualify for the finals automatically along with the two best-placed runners-up .
the other six second-placed teams will then be paired off to play each other over two-legged play-offs for the remaining three places . celebrity hosts make european draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierluigi collina despite the fact that the host country was not involved , the selection process was an exciting one for the germans as a number of potentially dramatic clashes were picked out in the european association ’ s draw by six-time formula one world champion michael schumacher and the highly respected italian referee pierluigi collina -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was in charge of the 2002 world cup final .
germany coach rudi völler watched with interest as a number of his european counterparts were drawn against tricky opponents . top europeans face tough groups the top seeds in the uefa group - england , france , portugal , sweden , the czech republic , spain , italy and turkey - were all separated but that didn ’ t mean that they would all avoid difficult challenges .
england face local rivalries against wales and northern ireland while italy take on berti vogts ’ scotland and the difficult norwegians .
former champions france will also face heavy resistance in their visits to the republic of ireland and switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hope to celebrate again at the next world cup .
turkey , third placed at japan / korea in 2002 , will have problems against the hard-to-beat danes and will face logistical as well as tactical headaches against old foes greece .
the czech republic will have to repeat their euro 2004 exploits against the dutch while portugal , sweden and spain will spend their qualification games laboring against awkward eastern european sides . african stars breathe easy the seeded african teams - which are hoping to fulfill brazilian legend pele ’ s prophecy that a nation from the continent will soon win the ultimate trophy - were also separated in their draw with cameroon , nigeria , south africa and senegal , france ’ s tormentors at last year ’ s competition , all destined to face lower opposition in the group stage . in the oceania group , favorites australia and their south pacific neighbors new zealand get a free ride into the second round of their qualification phase , a helping hand that could see the socceroos once again reach the play-off stages against one of the winners from the south america , asia or concacaf groups . long way to go for holders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have to qualify to defend their title this time .
the south american teams pushing for their own final spots in their qualification league are currently paraguay in first position , argentina and brazil in third after four games with 14 more to go . stange eyes german homecoming with iraq in the concacaf group , the united states , one of the favorites and world cup quarter-finalists in 2002 , will play the winner of the granada vs. guyana game in the second phase .

you could call it the 1 + 1 = 2 of learning , but the members of germany ’ s top education regulator call it " education standards . "
on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .

uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.12.2003 u.s. wants more nato involvement in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell urged nato to consider playing a bigger role in iraq .
the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- left -rrb- said he didn ’ t share washington ’ s concerns .
" we will need to cooperate on a european level , " he said .
in a separate interview with the financial times , fischer stressed that a militarily-stronger europe was good for nato .
" -lrb- european military involvement -rrb- in macedonia , serbia and montenegro has shown that an empowered europe is in the interest of nato .
it will remain the case in the future , " he argued . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato mulls eu defense plans eu defense ministers meeting in brussels are trying to sell plans for a beefed up european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .

in the wake of a dismal showing in an international survey of students ’ education , germany moves to introduce standardized curriculums and testing in each of the country ’ s schools . describe the theory of pythagoras .
calculate the surface of a trapezoid .
say two related sentences about your favorite food in a foreign language .
you could call it the 1 + 1 = 2 of learning , but the members of germany ’ s top education regulator call it " education standards . "
on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .
the standing committee has already agreed on standardized curriculums for german , mathematics and a student ’ s first foreign language , and they are slated to take effect with the start of the 2004-2005 school year .

the plans , which failed to garner opposition support earlier this year , are intended to regulate immigration .
they propose measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . the government coalition of social democrats and greens views immigration as a crucial tool to counter germany ’ s aging and declining population , which is expected to pose serious problems for the country ’ s social welfare systems and labor market in the coming decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every third german will be 60 or older by 2050 . while generally supportive of a new immigration law , leaders of the conservative opposition christian democrat union reject large portions of the proposal .
they say germany ’ s labor market can not handle more immigrants at the same time the country is struggling to deal with high unemployment rates . although heated debates surround the current proposals , most german politicians agree that immigration is necessary for the country ’ s future .
what lessons , then , can germany draw from the united states , which built itself on the fruits of immigrant labor and initiative ? u.s. a land of immigrants since its beginnings , the united states has been referred to as a melting pot .
it is a land of immigrants , who , with a trace of pride , still call themselves african-americans , irish-americans , italian-americans and german-americans generations after their ancestors first set foot on american soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-americans proudly display their heritage during the annual steuben parade in new york .
while many identify with their ethnic roots , they often see themselves first and foremost as americans .
this says a lot about the positive light in which immigration is perceived in the united states , despite some dark spots in u.s. immigration history . the 1882 chinese exclusion act , for example , barred chinese nationals from becoming u.s. citizens and was not repealed until 1943 .
a decade later , the 1952 immigration and nationality act targeted communists as unworthy of pledging their allegiance to the american flag . still , the united states takes in about 1.5 million immigrants each year , according to the washington-based center for immigration studies .
by comparison , 220,000 people have entered germany on average each year over the last decade , about half of the u.s. number when the population size of both countries is considered . immigrants in germany still struggling to fit in for the past 30 to 40 years , germany and immigrants who have moved here have been asking the question : what role will immigrants play in german society and will there be a kind of integration possible as is often pointed to in the united states ? workers from turkey and yugoslavia , who were brought to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii , have long struggled to obtain german citizenship without relinquishing their original nationalities . while most countries , including the u.s. , grant citizenship to anyone born on their territory , german citizenship was based on german descent until a few years ago .
that meant that despite living 20 years in the country and raising children , an entire family could still be considered foreign .
the law was changed to grant citizenship to children born to parents who had been living legally in the country for at least eight years . progress , despite a low level of tolerance germany has progressed , according to cem özdemir , a german of turkish origin and a former member of parliament for the green party .
still , he ’ s often dismayed by what he calls a “ low level of tolerance ” in german society . whereas in the united states immigration is seen as something positive , in germany it is often viewed rather negatively , he told dw-radio .
germany can learn a lot from the united states on the issue of integration of people with different ethnic backgrounds , özdemir added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost a third of the people living in berlin 's kreuzberg district are foreigners .
“ we should also try to achieve a color blind society where it is not important where your parents came from , but it is important what you try to contribute to the country in which you live , ” said özdemir , who is a candidate in the 2004 eu parliamentary elections . can the u.s. learn from the european experience ? on the other hand , germany ’ s experience with european integration and swelling immigrant communities from africa , asia , india and russia may rapidly be bringing about such change . vangala ram , a u.s. diplomat in germany , is convinced that the united states also has a few things to learn . “ i think it is a very interesting time to be in europe as an american , ” ram said . ” we can see clearly that a community of 25 nations is developing , although they have different languages and different living standards .
that ’ s clearly something that would interest us as americans . ” if the tables have begun to turn in germany , there has also been a change of attitudes in the u.s. after the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the u.s. position on immigration became less welcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american students demonstrate their support for muslim and arab immigrants after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks .
u.s. citizens began to see immigration as a threat to national security .
measures taken since 2001 have indeed made life more difficult for immigrants , particularly for those coming from the middle east .
but ram said he is hopeful that the country ’ s tendency to be a home to immigrants will not decline . the u.s. will have to try to replicate the kind of assimilation of immigrants achieved in the 19th and 20th centuries , although the ethnic and religious diversity of immigrants has increased .
“ we ’ ve done that in the past and i am very optimistic that we are going to be able to do that in the future , ” ram said . devora rogers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law .
immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them .

“ we hope that in 2005 , we will finally reach the bottom of the valley , ” said bvb head heinz-werner bonjean . he estimated that 160,000 jobs were lost in the construction industry this year , and said another 74,000 could be axed in 2004 . but the bvb said there are hopes for recovery , not least because germans have applied for an unusually high number of building permits in order to capitalise on government subsidies for home-builders before those funds are cut . more briefs 05.12.2003 -pipe- software ag seeks solutions in india 05.12.2003 -pipe- bayer opens new chemical factory 04.12.2003 -pipe- budget airlines to start lobbying group 04.12.2003 -pipe- schröder pushes for greater trade with kazakhstan 04.12.2003 -pipe- finance minister : germany to lower deficit by 2005 04.12.2003 -pipe- november unemployment rate falls in germany 03.12.2003 -pipe- bertelsmann expands book sales in china 03.12.2003 -pipe- germans worry chinese will acquire transrapid know-how 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

eu transportation ministers on friday discussed setting eu-wide rules for banning commercial trucks on europe ’ s highways on sundays .
germany and france fear newly harmonized regulations could weaken the ban . currently big commercial trucks are banned from germany ’ s roads on sundays and on saturdays during the summer .
although several other eu nations also have bans in place , the times and policies vary considerably . the european commission has for years pushed for common rules to be established .
officials in brussels are concerned that different policies create imbalances in the eu ’ s internal market and hinder the free transport of goods .
but germany ’ s deputy transportation minister ralf nagel on friday made clear that berlin would oppose the measure at all cost . “ we will never agree to a europe-wide regulation in this matter , ” nagel said in brussels according to the associated press .
“ this isn ’ t just any old matter , rather it ’ s an important question of national interest . ” berlin fears a new eu-wide policy will water down its own strict rules regulating heavy truck traffic on the weekends .
since germany will be at the heart of a expanded eu , berlin is concerned that heavy truck traffic will surge in coming years , endangering road safety and the environment . pressure on luxembourg however , in order to torpedo brussels plans , germany will have to convince some other countries to join in opposing the initiative .
currently only france and austria are also against the eu regulation of commercial truck traffic .
berlin and the other countries opposed have put pressure on tiny luxembourg to help them achieve the necessary blocking minority in the eu council of ministers . georg posaner , a spokesman for the austrian delegation , said late friday that luxembourg would back their position in brussels .
but there was no decision whether the eu presidency , currently represented by italy , would put the matter to a vote at the ministers ’ meeting or whether it would be postponed . currently in germany , heavy commercial trucks are banned from the roads from midnight to 10 p.m. on sundays all year and during the summer months also from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
saturdays .
austria , france , greece , italy , luxembourg and spain also all have some sort of ban on sundays . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de shipping companies put brakes on toll system as the government prepares for a showdown with deutsche telekom and daimlerchrysler over their consortium 's defective national toll system , truck drivers begin a grassroots boycott .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- left -rrb- said he didn ’ t share washington ’ s concerns .
" we will need to cooperate on a european level , " he said .
in a separate interview with the financial times , fischer stressed that a militarily-stronger europe was good for nato .
" -lrb- european military involvement -rrb- in macedonia , serbia and montenegro has shown that an empowered europe is in the interest of nato .
it will remain the case in the future , " he argued . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato mulls eu defense plans eu defense ministers meeting in brussels are trying to sell plans for a beefed up european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .

the plans , which failed to garner opposition support earlier this year , are intended to regulate immigration .
they propose measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . the government coalition of social democrats and greens views immigration as a crucial tool to counter germany ’ s aging and declining population , which is expected to pose serious problems for the country ’ s social welfare systems and labor market in the coming decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every third german will be 60 or older by 2050 . while generally supportive of a new immigration law , leaders of the conservative opposition christian democrat union reject large portions of the proposal .
they say germany ’ s labor market can not handle more immigrants at the same time the country is struggling to deal with high unemployment rates . although heated debates surround the current proposals , most german politicians agree that immigration is necessary for the country ’ s future .
what lessons , then , can germany draw from the united states , which built itself on the fruits of immigrant labor and initiative ? u.s. a land of immigrants since its beginnings , the united states has been referred to as a melting pot .
it is a land of immigrants , who , with a trace of pride , still call themselves african-americans , irish-americans , italian-americans and german-americans generations after their ancestors first set foot on american soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-americans proudly display their heritage during the annual steuben parade in new york .
while many identify with their ethnic roots , they often see themselves first and foremost as americans .
this says a lot about the positive light in which immigration is perceived in the united states , despite some dark spots in u.s. immigration history . the 1882 chinese exclusion act , for example , barred chinese nationals from becoming u.s. citizens and was not repealed until 1943 .
a decade later , the 1952 immigration and nationality act targeted communists as unworthy of pledging their allegiance to the american flag . still , the united states takes in about 1.5 million immigrants each year , according to the washington-based center for immigration studies .
by comparison , 220,000 people have entered germany on average each year over the last decade , about half of the u.s. number when the population size of both countries is considered . immigrants in germany still struggling to fit in for the past 30 to 40 years , germany and immigrants who have moved here have been asking the question : what role will immigrants play in german society and will there be a kind of integration possible as is often pointed to in the united states ? workers from turkey and yugoslavia , who were brought to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii , have long struggled to obtain german citizenship without relinquishing their original nationalities . while most countries , including the u.s. , grant citizenship to anyone born on their territory , german citizenship was based on german descent until a few years ago .
that meant that despite living 20 years in the country and raising children , an entire family could still be considered foreign .
the law was changed to grant citizenship to children born to parents who had been living legally in the country for at least eight years . progress , despite a low level of tolerance germany has progressed , according to cem özdemir , a german of turkish origin and a former member of parliament for the green party .
still , he ’ s often dismayed by what he calls a “ low level of tolerance ” in german society . whereas in the united states immigration is seen as something positive , in germany it is often viewed rather negatively , he told dw-radio .
germany can learn a lot from the united states on the issue of integration of people with different ethnic backgrounds , özdemir added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost a third of the people living in berlin 's kreuzberg district are foreigners .
“ we should also try to achieve a color blind society where it is not important where your parents came from , but it is important what you try to contribute to the country in which you live , ” said özdemir , who is a candidate in the 2004 eu parliamentary elections . can the u.s. learn from the european experience ? on the other hand , germany ’ s experience with european integration and swelling immigrant communities from africa , asia , india and russia may rapidly be bringing about such change . vangala ram , a u.s. diplomat in germany , is convinced that the united states also has a few things to learn . “ i think it is a very interesting time to be in europe as an american , ” ram said . ” we can see clearly that a community of 25 nations is developing , although they have different languages and different living standards .
that ’ s clearly something that would interest us as americans . ” if the tables have begun to turn in germany , there has also been a change of attitudes in the u.s. after the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the u.s. position on immigration became less welcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american students demonstrate their support for muslim and arab immigrants after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks .
u.s. citizens began to see immigration as a threat to national security .
measures taken since 2001 have indeed made life more difficult for immigrants , particularly for those coming from the middle east .
but ram said he is hopeful that the country ’ s tendency to be a home to immigrants will not decline . the u.s. will have to try to replicate the kind of assimilation of immigrants achieved in the 19th and 20th centuries , although the ethnic and religious diversity of immigrants has increased .

immigrants could be a boon for an aging population , but germans have ambivalent feelings about them .

“ we hope that in 2005 , we will finally reach the bottom of the valley , ” said bvb head heinz-werner bonjean . he estimated that 160,000 jobs were lost in the construction industry this year , and said another 74,000 could be axed in 2004 . but the bvb said there are hopes for recovery , not least because germans have applied for an unusually high number of building permits in order to capitalise on government subsidies for home-builders before those funds are cut . more briefs 05.12.2003 -pipe- software ag seeks solutions in india 05.12.2003 -pipe- bayer opens new chemical factory 04.12.2003 -pipe- budget airlines to start lobbying group 04.12.2003 -pipe- schröder pushes for greater trade with kazakhstan 04.12.2003 -pipe- finance minister : germany to lower deficit by 2005 04.12.2003 -pipe- november unemployment rate falls in germany 03.12.2003 -pipe- bertelsmann expands book sales in china 03.12.2003 -pipe- germans worry chinese will acquire transrapid know-how 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the draw for the qualification stages of the world cup 2006 took place in germany on friday with countries from around the globe hoping for smooth routes to the finals .

the draw , which placed the world ’ s teams in separate regional contests , threw up some enthralling games with much fancied european sides such as england , france and italy facing the prospect of difficult games against stiff opposition . a total of 198 countries were represented at the lavish affair which also boasted dignitaries from the global game ’ s governing bodies from europe , asia , africa , oceania , south america and concacaf -lrb- north / central america and the caribbean -rrb- boosting the attendance to almost 3,500 guests . the germans , with their plans for the soccer extravaganza already well underway , sat back with pride and without pressure as the large majority of the other contenders awaited the draw that would place them in groups with the chance to be among the 32 finalists competing in germany and maybe one of the two teams to contest the golden trophy in berlin on july 9 , 2006 . germany already qualify as hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer and pele have been here before .

the other six second-placed teams will then be paired off to play each other over two-legged play-offs for the remaining three places . celebrity hosts make european draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierluigi collina despite the fact that the host country was not involved , the selection process was an exciting one for the germans as a number of potentially dramatic clashes were picked out in the european association ’ s draw by six-time formula one world champion michael schumacher and the highly respected italian referee pierluigi collina -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was in charge of the 2002 world cup final .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.12.2003 germans consider u.s. experience in immigration debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : born in germany , but not necessarily german as german government and opposition officials meet on friday in an attempt to reach a compromise on proposals for a new immigration law , some say germany should look to the u.s. immigration experience for guidance . friday ’ s discussions could decide the fate of sweeping immigration law reforms proposed by the government .
the plans , which failed to garner opposition support earlier this year , are intended to regulate immigration .
they propose measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . the government coalition of social democrats and greens views immigration as a crucial tool to counter germany ’ s aging and declining population , which is expected to pose serious problems for the country ’ s social welfare systems and labor market in the coming decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every third german will be 60 or older by 2050 . while generally supportive of a new immigration law , leaders of the conservative opposition christian democrat union reject large portions of the proposal .
they say germany ’ s labor market can not handle more immigrants at the same time the country is struggling to deal with high unemployment rates . although heated debates surround the current proposals , most german politicians agree that immigration is necessary for the country ’ s future .
what lessons , then , can germany draw from the united states , which built itself on the fruits of immigrant labor and initiative ? u.s. a land of immigrants since its beginnings , the united states has been referred to as a melting pot .
it is a land of immigrants , who , with a trace of pride , still call themselves african-americans , irish-americans , italian-americans and german-americans generations after their ancestors first set foot on american soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-americans proudly display their heritage during the annual steuben parade in new york .
while many identify with their ethnic roots , they often see themselves first and foremost as americans .
this says a lot about the positive light in which immigration is perceived in the united states , despite some dark spots in u.s. immigration history . the 1882 chinese exclusion act , for example , barred chinese nationals from becoming u.s. citizens and was not repealed until 1943 .
a decade later , the 1952 immigration and nationality act targeted communists as unworthy of pledging their allegiance to the american flag . still , the united states takes in about 1.5 million immigrants each year , according to the washington-based center for immigration studies .
by comparison , 220,000 people have entered germany on average each year over the last decade , about half of the u.s. number when the population size of both countries is considered . immigrants in germany still struggling to fit in for the past 30 to 40 years , germany and immigrants who have moved here have been asking the question : what role will immigrants play in german society and will there be a kind of integration possible as is often pointed to in the united states ? workers from turkey and yugoslavia , who were brought to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii , have long struggled to obtain german citizenship without relinquishing their original nationalities . while most countries , including the u.s. , grant citizenship to anyone born on their territory , german citizenship was based on german descent until a few years ago .
that meant that despite living 20 years in the country and raising children , an entire family could still be considered foreign .
the law was changed to grant citizenship to children born to parents who had been living legally in the country for at least eight years . progress , despite a low level of tolerance germany has progressed , according to cem özdemir , a german of turkish origin and a former member of parliament for the green party .
still , he ’ s often dismayed by what he calls a “ low level of tolerance ” in german society . whereas in the united states immigration is seen as something positive , in germany it is often viewed rather negatively , he told dw-radio .
germany can learn a lot from the united states on the issue of integration of people with different ethnic backgrounds , özdemir added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost a third of the people living in berlin 's kreuzberg district are foreigners .
“ we should also try to achieve a color blind society where it is not important where your parents came from , but it is important what you try to contribute to the country in which you live , ” said özdemir , who is a candidate in the 2004 eu parliamentary elections . can the u.s. learn from the european experience ? on the other hand , germany ’ s experience with european integration and swelling immigrant communities from africa , asia , india and russia may rapidly be bringing about such change . vangala ram , a u.s. diplomat in germany , is convinced that the united states also has a few things to learn . “ i think it is a very interesting time to be in europe as an american , ” ram said . ” we can see clearly that a community of 25 nations is developing , although they have different languages and different living standards .
that ’ s clearly something that would interest us as americans . ” if the tables have begun to turn in germany , there has also been a change of attitudes in the u.s. after the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the u.s. position on immigration became less welcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american students demonstrate their support for muslim and arab immigrants after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks .
u.s. citizens began to see immigration as a threat to national security .
measures taken since 2001 have indeed made life more difficult for immigrants , particularly for those coming from the middle east .
but ram said he is hopeful that the country ’ s tendency to be a home to immigrants will not decline . the u.s. will have to try to replicate the kind of assimilation of immigrants achieved in the 19th and 20th centuries , although the ethnic and religious diversity of immigrants has increased .
“ we ’ ve done that in the past and i am very optimistic that we are going to be able to do that in the future , ” ram said . devora rogers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans reject sweeping immigration law germany 's higher legislative chamber rejected legislation that would have become its first immigration law .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- left -rrb- said he didn ’ t share washington ’ s concerns .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- left -rrb- said he didn ’ t share washington ’ s concerns .
" we will need to cooperate on a european level , " he said .

the plans , which failed to garner opposition support earlier this year , are intended to regulate immigration .
they propose measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . the government coalition of social democrats and greens views immigration as a crucial tool to counter germany ’ s aging and declining population , which is expected to pose serious problems for the country ’ s social welfare systems and labor market in the coming decades .

a decade later , the 1952 immigration and nationality act targeted communists as unworthy of pledging their allegiance to the american flag . still , the united states takes in about 1.5 million immigrants each year , according to the washington-based center for immigration studies .

still , he ’ s often dismayed by what he calls a “ low level of tolerance ” in german society . whereas in the united states immigration is seen as something positive , in germany it is often viewed rather negatively , he told dw-radio .
germany can learn a lot from the united states on the issue of integration of people with different ethnic backgrounds , özdemir added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost a third of the people living in berlin 's kreuzberg district are foreigners .
“ we should also try to achieve a color blind society where it is not important where your parents came from , but it is important what you try to contribute to the country in which you live , ” said özdemir , who is a candidate in the 2004 eu parliamentary elections . can the u.s. learn from the european experience ? on the other hand , germany ’ s experience with european integration and swelling immigrant communities from africa , asia , india and russia may rapidly be bringing about such change . vangala ram , a u.s. diplomat in germany , is convinced that the united states also has a few things to learn . “ i think it is a very interesting time to be in europe as an american , ” ram said . ” we can see clearly that a community of 25 nations is developing , although they have different languages and different living standards .
that ’ s clearly something that would interest us as americans . ” if the tables have begun to turn in germany , there has also been a change of attitudes in the u.s. after the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the u.s. position on immigration became less welcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american students demonstrate their support for muslim and arab immigrants after the sept .
11 terrorist attacks .
u.s. citizens began to see immigration as a threat to national security .
measures taken since 2001 have indeed made life more difficult for immigrants , particularly for those coming from the middle east .
but ram said he is hopeful that the country ’ s tendency to be a home to immigrants will not decline . the u.s. will have to try to replicate the kind of assimilation of immigrants achieved in the 19th and 20th centuries , although the ethnic and religious diversity of immigrants has increased .

the draw for the qualification stages of the world cup 2006 took place in germany on friday with countries from around the globe hoping for smooth routes to the finals .
europe ’ s top teams , however , had no such luck . frankfurt became the focus of the soccer world on friday when the qualification groups for the world cup 2006 in germany were drawn out of the hat in a ceremony in the city ’ s festhalle .
the draw , which placed the world ’ s teams in separate regional contests , threw up some enthralling games with much fancied european sides such as england , france and italy facing the prospect of difficult games against stiff opposition . a total of 198 countries were represented at the lavish affair which also boasted dignitaries from the global game ’ s governing bodies from europe , asia , africa , oceania , south america and concacaf -lrb- north / central america and the caribbean -rrb- boosting the attendance to almost 3,500 guests . the germans , with their plans for the soccer extravaganza already well underway , sat back with pride and without pressure as the large majority of the other contenders awaited the draw that would place them in groups with the chance to be among the 32 finalists competing in germany and maybe one of the two teams to contest the golden trophy in berlin on july 9 , 2006 . germany already qualify as hosts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer and pele have been here before .
germany as hosts are automatically installed as one of the finalists but for the first time ever , the current holders , brazil , will have to qualify through the group stages .
their federation has already held their qualification draw and the group stage , devised as a league format , has already begun in south america . unlike the south americans , the european teams were divided into three groups of seven and five groups of six , with each team playing their group opponents both home and away over the course of the qualification stage . the top side in each group will qualify for the finals automatically along with the two best-placed runners-up .
the other six second-placed teams will then be paired off to play each other over two-legged play-offs for the remaining three places . celebrity hosts make european draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pierluigi collina despite the fact that the host country was not involved , the selection process was an exciting one for the germans as a number of potentially dramatic clashes were picked out in the european association ’ s draw by six-time formula one world champion michael schumacher and the highly respected italian referee pierluigi collina -lrb- picture -rrb- , who was in charge of the 2002 world cup final .
germany coach rudi völler watched with interest as a number of his european counterparts were drawn against tricky opponents . top europeans face tough groups the top seeds in the uefa group - england , france , portugal , sweden , the czech republic , spain , italy and turkey - were all separated but that didn ’ t mean that they would all avoid difficult challenges .
england face local rivalries against wales and northern ireland while italy take on berti vogts ’ scotland and the difficult norwegians .
former champions france will also face heavy resistance in their visits to the republic of ireland and switzerland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hope to celebrate again at the next world cup .
turkey , third placed at japan / korea in 2002 , will have problems against the hard-to-beat danes and will face logistical as well as tactical headaches against old foes greece .
the czech republic will have to repeat their euro 2004 exploits against the dutch while portugal , sweden and spain will spend their qualification games laboring against awkward eastern european sides . african stars breathe easy the seeded african teams - which are hoping to fulfill brazilian legend pele ’ s prophecy that a nation from the continent will soon win the ultimate trophy - were also separated in their draw with cameroon , nigeria , south africa and senegal , france ’ s tormentors at last year ’ s competition , all destined to face lower opposition in the group stage . in the oceania group , favorites australia and their south pacific neighbors new zealand get a free ride into the second round of their qualification phase , a helping hand that could see the socceroos once again reach the play-off stages against one of the winners from the south america , asia or concacaf groups . long way to go for holders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil have to qualify to defend their title this time .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- left -rrb- said he didn ’ t share washington ’ s concerns .
" we will need to cooperate on a european level , " he said .

you could call it the 1 + 1 = 2 of learning , but the members of germany ’ s top education regulator call it " education standards . "
on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .
the standing committee has already agreed on standardized curriculums for german , mathematics and a student ’ s first foreign language , and they are slated to take effect with the start of the 2004-2005 school year .

" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.12.2003 germans consider u.s. experience in immigration debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : born in germany , but not necessarily german as german government and opposition officials meet on friday in an attempt to reach a compromise on proposals for a new immigration law , some say germany should look to the u.s. immigration experience for guidance . friday ’ s discussions could decide the fate of sweeping immigration law reforms proposed by the government .
the plans , which failed to garner opposition support earlier this year , are intended to regulate immigration .
they propose measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . the government coalition of social democrats and greens views immigration as a crucial tool to counter germany ’ s aging and declining population , which is expected to pose serious problems for the country ’ s social welfare systems and labor market in the coming decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every third german will be 60 or older by 2050 . while generally supportive of a new immigration law , leaders of the conservative opposition christian democrat union reject large portions of the proposal .
they say germany ’ s labor market can not handle more immigrants at the same time the country is struggling to deal with high unemployment rates . although heated debates surround the current proposals , most german politicians agree that immigration is necessary for the country ’ s future .
what lessons , then , can germany draw from the united states , which built itself on the fruits of immigrant labor and initiative ? u.s. a land of immigrants since its beginnings , the united states has been referred to as a melting pot .
it is a land of immigrants , who , with a trace of pride , still call themselves african-americans , irish-americans , italian-americans and german-americans generations after their ancestors first set foot on american soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-americans proudly display their heritage during the annual steuben parade in new york .
while many identify with their ethnic roots , they often see themselves first and foremost as americans .
this says a lot about the positive light in which immigration is perceived in the united states , despite some dark spots in u.s. immigration history . the 1882 chinese exclusion act , for example , barred chinese nationals from becoming u.s. citizens and was not repealed until 1943 .
a decade later , the 1952 immigration and nationality act targeted communists as unworthy of pledging their allegiance to the american flag . still , the united states takes in about 1.5 million immigrants each year , according to the washington-based center for immigration studies .
by comparison , 220,000 people have entered germany on average each year over the last decade , about half of the u.s. number when the population size of both countries is considered . immigrants in germany still struggling to fit in for the past 30 to 40 years , germany and immigrants who have moved here have been asking the question : what role will immigrants play in german society and will there be a kind of integration possible as is often pointed to in the united states ? workers from turkey and yugoslavia , who were brought to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii , have long struggled to obtain german citizenship without relinquishing their original nationalities . while most countries , including the u.s. , grant citizenship to anyone born on their territory , german citizenship was based on german descent until a few years ago .
that meant that despite living 20 years in the country and raising children , an entire family could still be considered foreign .
the law was changed to grant citizenship to children born to parents who had been living legally in the country for at least eight years . progress , despite a low level of tolerance germany has progressed , according to cem özdemir , a german of turkish origin and a former member of parliament for the green party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.12.2003 germans consider u.s. experience in immigration debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : born in germany , but not necessarily german as german government and opposition officials meet on friday in an attempt to reach a compromise on proposals for a new immigration law , some say germany should look to the u.s. immigration experience for guidance . friday ’ s discussions could decide the fate of sweeping immigration law reforms proposed by the government .
the plans , which failed to garner opposition support earlier this year , are intended to regulate immigration .
they propose measures to integrate foreigners into german society , including compulsory language and citizenship courses . the government coalition of social democrats and greens views immigration as a crucial tool to counter germany ’ s aging and declining population , which is expected to pose serious problems for the country ’ s social welfare systems and labor market in the coming decades .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every third german will be 60 or older by 2050 . while generally supportive of a new immigration law , leaders of the conservative opposition christian democrat union reject large portions of the proposal .
they say germany ’ s labor market can not handle more immigrants at the same time the country is struggling to deal with high unemployment rates . although heated debates surround the current proposals , most german politicians agree that immigration is necessary for the country ’ s future .
what lessons , then , can germany draw from the united states , which built itself on the fruits of immigrant labor and initiative ? u.s. a land of immigrants since its beginnings , the united states has been referred to as a melting pot .
it is a land of immigrants , who , with a trace of pride , still call themselves african-americans , irish-americans , italian-americans and german-americans generations after their ancestors first set foot on american soil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-americans proudly display their heritage during the annual steuben parade in new york .
while many identify with their ethnic roots , they often see themselves first and foremost as americans .
this says a lot about the positive light in which immigration is perceived in the united states , despite some dark spots in u.s. immigration history . the 1882 chinese exclusion act , for example , barred chinese nationals from becoming u.s. citizens and was not repealed until 1943 .
a decade later , the 1952 immigration and nationality act targeted communists as unworthy of pledging their allegiance to the american flag . still , the united states takes in about 1.5 million immigrants each year , according to the washington-based center for immigration studies .
by comparison , 220,000 people have entered germany on average each year over the last decade , about half of the u.s. number when the population size of both countries is considered . immigrants in germany still struggling to fit in for the past 30 to 40 years , germany and immigrants who have moved here have been asking the question : what role will immigrants play in german society and will there be a kind of integration possible as is often pointed to in the united states ? workers from turkey and yugoslavia , who were brought to germany to help rebuild the country after world war ii , have long struggled to obtain german citizenship without relinquishing their original nationalities . while most countries , including the u.s. , grant citizenship to anyone born on their territory , german citizenship was based on german descent until a few years ago .
that meant that despite living 20 years in the country and raising children , an entire family could still be considered foreign .
the law was changed to grant citizenship to children born to parents who had been living legally in the country for at least eight years . progress , despite a low level of tolerance germany has progressed , according to cem özdemir , a german of turkish origin and a former member of parliament for the green party .
still , he ’ s often dismayed by what he calls a “ low level of tolerance ” in german society . whereas in the united states immigration is seen as something positive , in germany it is often viewed rather negatively , he told dw-radio .
germany can learn a lot from the united states on the issue of integration of people with different ethnic backgrounds , özdemir added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost a third of the people living in berlin 's kreuzberg district are foreigners .
“ we should also try to achieve a color blind society where it is not important where your parents came from , but it is important what you try to contribute to the country in which you live , ” said özdemir , who is a candidate in the 2004 eu parliamentary elections . can the u.s. learn from the european experience ? on the other hand , germany ’ s experience with european integration and swelling immigrant communities from africa , asia , india and russia may rapidly be bringing about such change . vangala ram , a u.s. diplomat in germany , is convinced that the united states also has a few things to learn . “ i think it is a very interesting time to be in europe as an american , ” ram said . ” we can see clearly that a community of 25 nations is developing , although they have different languages and different living standards .
that ’ s clearly something that would interest us as americans . ” if the tables have begun to turn in germany , there has also been a change of attitudes in the u.s. after the terrorist attacks of september 11th , the u.s. position on immigration became less welcoming . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american students demonstrate their support for muslim and arab immigrants after the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.12.2003 u.s. wants more nato involvement in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of state colin powell urged nato to consider playing a bigger role in iraq .
the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- left -rrb- said he didn ’ t share washington ’ s concerns .

the u.s. asked nato to play a greater role in iraq at a foreign ministers ' meeting on thursday .
the summit has been clouded by a deepening row over eu ambitions to develop independent military capabilities . nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels on thursday were debating a wider role for the security alliance in postwar iraq following a request by washington , the first clear sign of help since the beginning of the u.s.-led war against iraq .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell " ...
the united states welcomes a greater nato role in iraq ’ s stabilization , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a prepared text .
" we urge the alliance to examine how it might do more to support peace and stability in iraq , which every leader has acknowledged is critical to all of us , " the text read .
the u.s. call for more military help from nato in iraq has been backed by outgoing nato secretary general lord robertson .
" the alliance must continue to help nato countries who take on leadership roles in iraq , and prepare itself to take on new roles and missions where necessary , " robertson said at the start of the meeting .
nato role in iraq still open washington ’ s request follows recent proposals by spain , poland and italy for nato to assume a more direct role in iraq in 2004 and possibly even take over the multinational peacekeeping division currently led by poland , just as it did recently in afghanistan .
nato is currently involved in providing logistical help to the polish-led peacekeeping contingent in south-central iraq .
a total of 18 current and future members of nato have also individually sent troops to iraq .
" we should keep in mind the fact that most of the nato member states are present in iraq , " polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewic told reporters at the alliance ’ s headquarters on thursday .
" we believe that it would be wise if nato engages itself , involves itself , deeper in the future . "
but washington ’ s request for further nato involvement in iraq , in the face of mounting u.s. casualties and costs , is unlikely to be endorsed by all of the alliance ’ s members .
in particular , france and germany , staunch opponents of the u.s.-led war against iraq , are expected to reiterate demands for a stronger u.n. role in overseeing peacekeeping operations before they authorize greater nato participation .
eu military ambitions still a sore point thursday ’ s ministerial meeting also grappled with the ongoing transatlantic row over the european union ’ s plans to develop its own defense capabilities , independent of nato .
the proposals , agreed upon in naples last week by europe ’ s big three , allow germany , france and britain to set up an autonomous military planning unit capable of overseeing military operations .
the eu plans have angered washington , which believes they could undermine nato .
six weeks ago the u.s. administration slammed eu military plans , calling them " the most serious threat " to nato ’ s future .
since then , the plan has been watered down and criticism has been more muted , with u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld preferring to play down the dispute .
however on thursday , u.s. secretary of state , powell made it clear washington was not prepared to back down over the eu project , seen by some as an attempt by brussels to act as a counterweight to u.s. military power .
" the united states can not accept independent eu structures that duplicate existing nato capabilities , " powell said .

you could call it the 1 + 1 = 2 of learning , but the members of germany ’ s top education regulator call it " education standards . "
on thursday , the standing conference of ministers of education and cultural affairs , the country ’ s top schools authority , approved the biggest and most crucial educational reform package in germany since the country ’ s students flunked the recent pisa international school comparison .
for the first time , germany plans to introduce nationwide curriculum that sets the standards for the knowledge and capabilities students are expected to possess at the end of each level of education .
education policy-makers say they want to improve the quality of schools and make them more accountable .
" up to now , we always defined what , when and at which point in time children should be taught , " said karin wolff , president of the standing conference .
" but it ’ s gotten to the point where academic levels in the different german states can vary as much as two years .
now we want curriculum standards , in other words , we want to specify competencies that should be achieved by the end of certain phases of schooling .
but they also give schools considerable leeway in how they achieve them . "
uniform learning and that , the conference hopes , will pave the way for standardized knowledge in germany , bringing greater order to the country ’ s federalist school system , which leaves most education-related decision-making at the state level .
germany , too , is the only country in the world that has three different types of high schools - the hauptschule for lower-achieving students , the middle-tier realschule and the college-prep gymnasium .
germany ’ s 16 states each have their own school infrastructures , and the only trait they universally share is the four-year grundschule primary school .
until now , the states have insisted on maintaining their autonomy in matters of education .
despite the uniformity the standing councils plans to impose in the next school year , states will still retain a great deal of control over classrooms .
" in principle , in two areas it creates even greater freedom than before , " wolff said .
" one is that the states that commit to the standards will be able to decide on their own how to achieve the goals , using different methods based on differing traditions .
individual schools will also have a high degree of freedom and can take different pedagogical paths using different approaches to time and different methods of learning . "
germany ’ s powerful educators ’ union , gew , criticized the new policy , saying the rise or fall of educational standards is the responsibility of schools , teachers , pupils and their parents .
to introduce standardized testing and school rankings would merely compound existing problems , the union maintained .

the charity carers uk estimates that up to £ 660m is going unclaimed every year .
it says many people do not view themselves as carers , especially those looking after friends or relatives .
over two million people become carers every year and they are entitled to an allowance whatever the relationship , the charity says .
financial support carers uk launched its report on friday , which it has made carers ' rights day .
it has produced a series of new leaflets to raise awareness of the financial support available through the carer 's allowance .
health minister stephen ladyman said the government backed the campaign and that reaching hidden carers continues to be a real concern .
he stressed the importance of local authorities and charities working together to help carers in their communities .
' moral ' arguments imelda redmond , chief executive of carers uk , said : " many people do n't see themselves as carers , but as mothers , sons , partners and friends and may not know that they are entitled to help as carers . "
ms redmond said the work of carers had been valued at £ 57bn a year and was of vital importance to the uk .
" there are clear moral and economic arguments to make sure carers know about the support that is available , " she added .
the charity said many carers faced financial hardship , cutting back on food and essential bills like heat and lighting to make ends meet .
read a selection of your comments .
check with your gp and social services and keep pestering them , do n't accept being fobbed off mike , uk my mother has alzheimer 's and is looked after by my 70-year-old father .
he gets a carers allowance for 24 hour care .
mum also goes to a day care centre 4 days a week and he gets four 2 week respite breaks each year .
check with your gp and social services and keep pestering them , do n't accept being fobbed off .
if the carer also has health issues , as my father does , then the gp can write to social services advising them that the carers health is at risk as well and if they do n't do something they will both end up in a hospital or a care home .
mike , uk i have copd and ca n't do much as at times , i ca n't move , my wife has to do most jobs about the house , plus take care of me .
she has had both hips replaced .
i get full mobility , but my wife gets nothing for helping me .
i hate that as it 's like she does not count , and without her i 'd be lost .
on the other hand you feel too scared that you may end up worse off , that it puts you off claiming .
philip , uk my parents have n't had a holiday in 10 years because they look after my 102 year-old grandfather , and he refuses to go into a home -lrb- even for respite care -rrb- .
they cook and clean for him , and often have to help him bathe - it would be nice to see them receive some recognition for their trouble and sacrifice .
jo payne , uk my mother has cared for my physically and mentally handicapped sister since birth .
she is now 40 and my mother is 67 .
since my mother got to retirement age she can no longer claim a carers allowance and would like my sister to be placed into care .
she can not get a suitable place close to home , she can not get any financial help as she has " retired " from caring !
if she gave my sister up at birth the state would have had 40 years of the costs to look after my sister .
now my mother gets too tired to look after her daughter the state treats her like dirt .

there was a sharp drop in deaths due to a lack of access to high-dependency or intensive therapy unit beds .
but the figures identified a rise in the number of frail elderly people who died after being admitted to hospital for emergency treatment last year .
the scottish audit of surgical mortality -lrb- sasm -rrb- report was hailed by health minister malcolm chisholm .
he said : " the report shows that the number of patients who died while in surgical care has fallen again , including a further substantial reduction in the number of patients who died through a lack of access to high-dependency or intensive therapy unit beds .
" the report also highlights the growing issue with the pattern of care of an increasingly ageing and frail population within surgical wards . "
" consultants themselves have called for patients to have access to figures about the doctors that will treat them " shona robison snp health spokeswoman the report identifies all deaths in hospital under a surgeon 's care , whether or not an operation has taken place .
the number of reported deaths has fallen from 4,493 in 2001 to 4,449 in 2002 .
patient deaths in surgical care reached a high of 4,579 in 1996 .
more than 90 % of the deaths last year followed emergency admissions .
the report said the number of deaths following pre-planned , or elective , surgery was also continuing to fall .
the number of deaths associated with the non-availability or failure to use intensive care or high dependency units has fallen from 113 to 21 in the space of two years .
death rates scottish national party health spokeswoman shona robison said the fall in surgical deaths was good news .
she argued that the publication of success rate statistics should be taken " to the next level " .
" consultants themselves have called for patients to have access to figures about the doctors that will treat them , " she said .
" by giving patients the ability to see clinical outcome figures , including death rates , we can create a new engine for improvement , and give patients a clear , unambiguous understanding of the risk they face before they decide to go ahead with their operation . "

the discovery of the devastating potato disease was confirmed on john morgan 's farm in bwlch in the brecon beacons , during an annual survey by defra in november .
mr morgan , who could face losses of up to £ 400,000 , has been told that no compensation will be available to him from the welsh assembly government .
a month after the outbreak on middlewood farm the potato business is yet to re-start .
mr morgan said he knows taking legal action could be a long drawn out process .
" we 've got to try and keep cool as it 's not going to happen in five minutes , " he said .
" the biggest problem is surviving in the meantime because you 're expecting to be able to sell this crop .
" there 's so much monetary pressure , " he added .
' massive blow ' although ring rot poses no risk to human health , farmers leaders in wales said the news was a " massive blow " to the industry and has been branded the potato equivalent of foot-and-mouth .
annual losses to us potato farmers caused by ring rot have been as high as 50 % .
farmers are also worried about the effect on the seed market if the uk loses its disease-free status .
the uk 's first outbreak of ring rot was found at middlewood farm so far tests on 80,000 samples at middlewood farm have shown that only one batch of imported potatoes is contaminated .
a total of 20 tons of potatoes imported from holland will have to be destroyed but officials still have to decide what to do with the rest .
transporting the potatoes off the farm for destruction could cost £ 25,000 .
disinfection of the farm buildings and machinery would cost much more .
with no compensation on offer and warnings that the farm could be out of business for four years , mr morgan has begun a legal battle over who is to blame .
potato ring rot is a disease which is widespread in crops across europe , having been identified in recent years in france , the netherlands and denmark .
the disease appears as black rings within the potato and the vegetable rots .

" we 've got to try and keep cool as it 's not going to happen in five minutes , " he said .
" the biggest problem is surviving in the meantime because you 're expecting to be able to sell this crop .
" there 's so much monetary pressure , " he added .
' massive blow ' although ring rot poses no risk to human health , farmers leaders in wales said the news was a " massive blow " to the industry and has been branded the potato equivalent of foot-and-mouth .
annual losses to us potato farmers caused by ring rot have been as high as 50 % .
farmers are also worried about the effect on the seed market if the uk loses its disease-free status .
the uk 's first outbreak of ring rot was found at middlewood farm so far tests on 80,000 samples at middlewood farm have shown that only one batch of imported potatoes is contaminated .
a total of 20 tons of potatoes imported from holland will have to be destroyed but officials still have to decide what to do with the rest .
transporting the potatoes off the farm for destruction could cost £ 25,000 .
disinfection of the farm buildings and machinery would cost much more .
with no compensation on offer and warnings that the farm could be out of business for four years , mr morgan has begun a legal battle over who is to blame .
potato ring rot is a disease which is widespread in crops across europe , having been identified in recent years in france , the netherlands and denmark .
the disease appears as black rings within the potato and the vegetable rots .

the luton-based no-frills carrier said it had flown 1.7 million passengers in november , up by nearly 15 % on the same period last year .
its load factor - the number of passengers carried as a proportion of available seats - rose to 81.5 % from 80.5 % one year earlier .
" these figures reflect strong sustainable growth at easyjet , " said chief executive ray webster .
" low cost and convenience remain key to the future development of the low cost airline industry . "
rivalry mr webster added that easyjet passengers expected " reliability and consistency of destinations " - a clear reference to arch-rival ryanair 's decision earlier this week to suspend some of its routes .
on wednesday , ryanair axed nine unprofitable routes , and replaced them with new services to other european destinations .
the move is thought likely to anger regular passengers who have bought second homes near the destinations that ryanair has abandoned .
easyjet 's november figures compare with ryanair 's tally of 2 million passengers , and a load factor of 83 % , down from 84 % a year ago .
the two airlines - europe 's biggest no-frills carriers - have enjoyed rapid growth over the past three years , luring thousands of passengers away from full-service airlines .
but conditions are getting tougher for budget carriers , with many of their larger rivals responding with aggressive ticket discounts .
last month , easyjet said profits for the full financial year had fallen by 28 % to £ 52m , blaming one-off costs and the fallout from the iraq war .
easyjet shares were down 6.25p. or 2.1 % , in early trade in london .

some say the eurozone 's stability pact is outdated the twelve countries in the eurozone - including france , italy , and germany - have pooled their currencies and now have interest rates set by a single central bank , the frankfurt-based european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
but they were also supposed to coordinate their fiscal policies , keeping budget deficits below 3 % of gdp , in order to ensure that rising government debt did not undermine the ecb 's attempt to control inflation .
eu budget deal france and germany escape disciplinary action both agree to cut deficits , but not by as much as the commission wanted the two will not have to make even those cuts if economic growth is less than expected last month the eurozone 's two largest economies , france and germany , defied those limits and blocked european finance ministers from imposing large fines on their economies , on the grounds that they were still deep in recession .
german and french finance ministers - and the uk chancellor gordon brown - have argued that the stability pact rules are too rigid and must be applied with more flexibility if they are to be effective .
new role , fewer rules now a leading research organisation , the centre for economic policy research , argues that the strict rules of the stability pact should be scrapped entirely and replaced with an independent review body which would have the sole right to judge whether countries were going too far into the red .
the new " sustainability council " would be appointed by the european parliament , and like the uk 's monetary policy committee , they would be independent experts appointed for a fixed term , and accountable and open in their deliberations .
it would look at total public debt as well as the yearly deficit , and have the power to interpret the rules flexibly in different countries .
in the last resort , the sustainability council - rather than the european commission - would be the body that would recommend fines and public criticism for countries who are spending too much .
challenge of flexibility the challenge for managing the eurozone 's finances , according to ed balls , the chief economic advisor to chancellor gordon brown , is to combine rules which are strict enough to be credible with financial markets , while retaining enough flexibility to adopt to changing economic conditions .
future eu members will find the stability pact hard-going mr balls is highly sceptical of the stability pact , which he said has sometimes given the impression that " it is whatever -lrb- european finance -rrb- ministers agree it says . "
but mr balls , who chaired the meeting launching the new proposals , also appeared to be concerned that a proposed council of experts might not have the authority to curb the fiscal excesses of some european countries .
he pointedly asked whether some countries in europe had deliberately run large budget deficits regardless of their commitments to adhere to the stability pact .
the author of the report , andrew hughes hallett , pointed out that the fiscal rules like the 3 % budget limit had been much easier to enforce in the run-up to the launch of the euro , when countries who exceeded the target would have been excluded from membership altogether .
and he said that , in his view , a number of countries had been steadily increasing their government spending once inside the eurozone .
why have rules ?
professor hallett said that the stability pact was flawed for several reasons .
it lacked a clear goal , it was too rigid , and there was no credible body to enforce it .
he also pointed out that the fixed budget deficit rules acted in the wrong direction during economic downturns , when the " automatic stabilisers " -lrb- such as increased spending on unemployment benefits -rrb- would stabilise the economy but destabilise the budget .
and professor hallett argued that the current stability pact also might work against " structural reforms " like more flexible labour markets that many economists see as essential to make europe more prosperous .
that is because the short-term cost of those reforms would also push countries like germany over the budget limits , despite their longer-term benefits .
no golden rule but designing a set of rules that would fit all the countries in the eurozone was very difficult , he said .
that is partly because the small countries in the eurozone are growing quite fast , while the larger countries are lagging behind and accumulating bigger budget deficits .
the implicit assumption in the maastricht treaty rules was that on average , countries would grow by 5 % per year , and thus a 3 % deficit would be sustainable as long as total public debt stayed at or below 60 % of gdp .
although the stability pact has proved deeply flawed , many economists believe that eurozone countries need to stick to some agreed limits on budget deficits in order to help control inflation otherwise , countries would be tempted to over-borrow to counter the effects of monetary policy , eventually lowering their credit rating .

the decision , which comes ahead of presidential elections in 2004 , follows a series of kidnappings which have particularly targeted the ethnic chinese community .
mrs arroyo has appeared to waver over the moratorium , which was first imposed by her predecessor following pressure from the powerful catholic church .
her decision to lift the freeze follows a number of high-profile abductions for ransom .
much as i am averse to the taking of human lives in this manner , the president must yield to the higher public interest president arroyo these included the murder in november of coca-cola executive betti sy , a filipino-chinese whose body was found by a roadside .
three days later , a 10-year-old ethnic chinese girl was abducted outside her school in manila .
public pressure in the past , mrs arroyo has used her powers as president to grant clemency to those sentenced to death by the courts .
but on friday mrs arroyo said in a statement : " i shall no longer stand in the way of executions scheduled by the courts for january 2004 . "
" much as i am averse , as a matter of moral principle , to the taking of human lives in this manner , the president must yield to the higher public interest when dictated by extraordinary circumstances , " she said .
the change of heart will be welcomed by leaders of the filipino-chinese community , who have criticised the government 's record on tackling violent crime .
they say many kidnappings go unreported because families do not trust the police .

the lancet said tens of thousands of lives would be saved by making tobacco an illegal substance and possession of cigarettes a crime .
it said 80 % of britons were non-smokers , who had " the right to freedom from exposure to proven carcinogens " .
an estimated 1,000 people a year in britain died from inhaling second-hand tobacco smoke , its editorial claimed .
smokers group forest greeted the lancet 's call with " amusement and disbelief " .
why do we allow a product that kills ?
dr astrid james , the lancet it said : " like it or not , people choose to smoke , just as they choose to drink alcohol , eat certain types of food , or take part in extreme sports . "
according to the lancet passive smoking not only kills , but makes it more difficult for smokers to quit .

carl roberts , england send us your comments dr astrid james , deputy editor of the lancet , told bbc radio 4 's today programme that smoking created a " public health burden " , killing 120,000 in the uk and 4.2m worldwide every year .
she said bringing an end to smoking would prevent a third of deaths due to cancer in the uk , one in seven deaths from heart disease and most deaths and illness due to chronic lung disease .
" why do we allow a product that kills ? " she said .
but chief executive of the tobacco manufacturers ' association tim lord said millions choose to smoke despite knowing the risks .
he said a suggestion by dr james that many smokers and non-smokers did n't realise the extent of the burden on society , was " patronising " .
it is a little bit extreme for us in britain to start locking people up because they have an ounce of tobacco somewhere .
john reid " to say that people do n't understand the health risks associated with smoking when on every single pack there are enormous health warnings , i just find unbelievable , " he told today on friday .
the medical journal also argued that the cost of cigarettes and tobacco was less important than availability and acceptability .
" cigarette smoking is a dangerous addiction , " it said .
" we should be doing a great deal more to prevent this disease and to help its victims .
we call on tony blair 's government to ban tobacco . " £ 9.3bn revenue dr james said the government had already shown it was willing to pass similar legislation , such as banning the use of hand held mobile phones while driving .
what next ?
will they urge the government to ban fatty foods and dairy products ?
simon clark she said : " that was in the face of 20 deaths over five years . "
" why is the government not taking a stronger stance here ? "
the lancet also questioned the government 's claim that the british public was still to be convinced of the need for a public smoking ban , as introduced in parts of the us , canada , thailand , and southern australia .
it said ordinary people were better equipped to consider the arguments than the government , " perhaps because the uk public does not have to consider directly the £ 9.3bn per year raised in tax revenue on tobacco " .
in comparison , the £ 1.5bn cost to the nhs of smoking-related diseases was " paltry " , the lancet argued .
it made its case a month after leaders of the 18 royal colleges of medicine wrote a letter to the times attacking the government 's failure to ban smoking in public .
forest director simon clark said the lancet was " the true voice of the rabid anti-smoking zealot " .
he said smokers should not be treated as criminals , adding : " the health fascists are on the march .

she said bringing an end to smoking would prevent a third of deaths due to cancer in the uk , one in seven deaths from heart disease and most deaths and illness due to chronic lung disease .
" why do we allow a product that kills ? " she said .

he said a suggestion by dr james that many smokers and non-smokers did n't realise the extent of the burden on society , was " patronising " .
it is a little bit extreme for us in britain to start locking people up because they have an ounce of tobacco somewhere .
john reid " to say that people do n't understand the health risks associated with smoking when on every single pack there are enormous health warnings , i just find unbelievable , " he told today on friday .

regional development agency one northeast has pledged £ 4.6m for the project in middlesbrough .
the cash , which is being channelled through the tees valley partnership , will go towards the construction of the new glass art gallery and to develop a cultural quarter in the town .
the creation of a civic square around the gallery that will link to middlesbrough 's central library , other key public buildings and existing open-air artworks , is also planned .
it is expected that the new gallery will attract about 110,000 visitors a year .
alan clarke , chief executive of one northeast , said : " one northeast 's £ 4.6m pledge is a demonstration of our confidence in the gallery and its new cultural quarter as a major economic driver for middlesbrough and the wider tees valley .

"
the three-storey art gallery is being designed by dutch architects , erik van egeraat associates and will feature an impressive glass fronted entrance , eight separate exhibition spaces , workshops , an education suite and auditorium and a conservation studio .

alistair arkley , chairman of the tees valley partnership added : " the gallery will be at the heart of a new cultural quarter that will bring huge benefits to the town as well as improved facilities for local people .

surendra shaha says his weekly prayer ritual is helping him incense sticks smoulder and pots of coloured powders and oil lie in careful array .
the priest mutters verses from hindu scripture , smears red paste on surendra 's forehead then blows on a conch shell to summon the gods .
surendra is hiv positive and this is a weekly ritual organised by his mother to keep his spirits up , to bring him in touch with his culture and religion .
by all accounts , it 's working .
" he 's doing very well , " says mrs shaha , " thanks to the gods and the daily prayers . "
they listen and respect us because we are monks .
so much has changed ven phra tuangsit , aids activist and monk surendra - wearing a t-shirt proclaiming " 3 million " , the worldwide death toll from aids - says he has rediscovered his hindu faith lately .
" my mother was always after me to pray more , to pay more attention to god .
now i do and it 's working .
i feel happy and healthy , i 'm living a normal life . "
change of heart the role of religion in combating hiv / aids can be a controversial one .
orthodox thinkers in most major faiths have , in the past , denounced those who fall ill with the virus that causes aids , suggesting their fate is divine punishment for immoral behaviour - but no longer .
at a conference in kathmandu this week , bringing together representatives of all of south asia 's many religious faiths and hiv / aids activists , speaker after speaker has been calling for compassion and tolerance for victims .
ven phra tuangsit 's aids project in thailand will be copied elsewhere unicef south asia director dr sadig rasheed says : " we need religious leaders to help us in every way , to pray for the sick , to comfort those inflicted and to help spread awareness and prevention strategies . "
once , aids activists despaired at conservative religious attitudes .
the international conference on population and development in cairo in 1994 was largely seen as a failure on the question of hiv / aids , because the various religious delegates opposed measures like condom distribution to stop the spread of the disease .
" we thought we 'd be fighting religion tooth and nail after that , " said a member of a large international charity , requesting anonymity .
star monk the organisers of the kathmandu meeting say things have changed ; faiths and hiv / aids workers are converging , compromising and learning to live with each other 's attitudes and priorities .
one of the stars of this week 's conference in nepal is buddhist monk ven phra tuangsit from nong khai in thailand .
an aids activist addresses delegates at the sai baba temple he leads a project called sangha metta that many want to see duplicated in other parts of south asia .
buddhist clerics involved in the project work with young people , sex workers and others to spread awareness of hiv / aids , including demonstrating how to use condoms , if appropriate .
" at first people were worried that it was inappropriate , " says the saffron clad monk , " for a buddhist cleric to work with condoms and things , but now people realise that i 'm practising buddhist compassion and helping people avoid painful , humiliating illness . "
" they listen and respect us because we are monks .
so much has changed . "
in the audience , listening to tuangsit speak , are mosque imams from the north west frontier province of pakistan , perhaps the most religiously orthodox region of south asia .
they sit alongside catholic priests and discuss the meeting 's progress in hushed tones , keeping their opinions to themselves for now .
but with hiv / aids set to become south asia 's biggest public health challenge very soon , it 's clear that the men and women who serve god have decided they have a role to play in helping the present and future victims of a dreaded epidemic .
