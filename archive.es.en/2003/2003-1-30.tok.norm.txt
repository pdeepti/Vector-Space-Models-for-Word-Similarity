war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .
at the same time , u.s. secretary of state colin powell also requested to be interviewed by one of these stations , and a key adviser to the pentagon , richard perle , spoke out in a newspaper interview about the meaningless of schröder 's opposition .
chancellor 's stakes out position schröder 's opposition to a possible war on iraq took shape during the summer while he was campaigning for re-election .
taking a position that contrasted with his support of the 1999 war against yugoslavia , schröder pledged that german troops would not join any u.s.-led military campaign against saddam hussein .
last week , the chancellor went even further in his opposition , telling a campaign rally in his home state of lower saxony that germany would not support any security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
in his television interview with the ard network , schröder elaborated on the reasons for his opposition .
" the germans have had their own experiences with war , " he said .
" and that has left a deep mark on their collective conscience .
therefore , people have to understand that we - when faced with the question of war as a normal part of political options - have a position based on principle . "
the chancellor also expressed his disappointment with bush 's failure to present evidence earlier in the debate .
" i would have liked for intelligence information - from whatever source - to have been put on the table at the start of the process , " he said .
in the address , bush said he would send secretary of state colin powell to the united nations next wednesday to share intelligence on iraq .
administration officials said the data showed saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
powell seeks to sway germans powell , in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday , said he hoped the germans would change their minds after seeing the new information .
" we hope that in the next few days , when we discuss this together , the german public and its political leaders will look at everything in a different light , " powell said .
but key adviser to the pentagon richard perle suggested in an interview with a munich newspaper that schröder and the country he represents no longer mattered .
schröder has assumed " such an extreme position that he has taken germany and himself out of the debate , " perle told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" germany is irrelevant .
and it is not particularly easy for a german chancellor to make his country irrelevant . "
state of the union speech sparks criticism unlike schröder and fischer , who welcomed bush 's state of the union address , other members of the parties that form germany 's governing coalition proved more skeptical and voiced their criticism on wednesday .
gernot erler , the vice chairman of the social democratic group in the german parliament , said in a television interview , " it is clear that the american president actually does not want to end a program of weapons of mass destruction in iraq , but is dead set on waging war and is looking for justification for his action . "
erler and angelika beer , the co-leader of the junior coalition partner , the green party , also questioned bush 's motives for pledging to turn over more information to the security council .
" the question naturally arises : why was n't bush 's proof presented to the u.n. long ago ? "
beer said in an early morning radio interview .
erler said he doubted that bush actually wanted to work with the united nations .
" why is he withholding this supposed secret information and then planning to pull a rabbit out of his hat next week ? " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

at the pre-festival press conference this week , berlinale director dieter kosslick called to " shoot films , not people " . the possibility of a war in iraq has already thrown a shadow over germany 's most glamourous culture highlight , the berlinale film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it even influenced the selection of films for the annual festival competition , berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday - in the case of a war the festival would focus on political films and would hold daily discussions .
this year 's motto " towards tolerance " did not just refer to the mixture of " intelligent entertainment film and challenging cinema " , kosslick said , but also showed that a competition with international artists could be a peaceful affair . so far , however , this year 's berlinale is set to run as planned , and hopes to attract more than 100,000 visitors to berlin 's cinemas for ten days of the best and the newest in world cinema .
300 films will be on show , including 59 german productions , the highest number in the history of the festival .
in addition , three german films will be running for the golden bear , the berlinale film award , along with a further 19 movies . further highlights include a series of films starring legendary french actress anouk aimée , 26 world premiers , a selection of " artistically orientated contemporary film " – 52 films from 24 countries - , and a " lively overview of the results of world cinema in the past 12 months " featured in the berlinale panorama section : 17 films , 12 documentaries and 23 short films from 31 countries . in addition , this year 's berlinale will have a strong focus on short film , with a new separate short film festival hosting 57 films with which the berlinale hopes to direct the audience 's attention to " a medium , in which newcomers can prove and distinguish themselves . "
and an international children 's film festival will feature parallel to the berlinale , the largest in the history of the berlinale yet – a development which , according to thomas hailer , director of the children 's festival , proves how " films all over the world are showing more and more respect to children . " important for the film industry but the main attraction to the berlinale is due to be the entourage of stars in the german capital for the event .
although berlin may lack the glamour and style of film festival hosts venice and cannes , the sheer volume of visitors makes it one of the most important venues for the film business in the world . this year , numerous names from the film industry have announced their arrival in berlin for the festival , including directors spike lee , oliver stone , michael winterbottom and oskar roehler , and world famous actors kevin spacey , macaulay culkin , catherine zeta-jones and george cloony . and the public will have the chance to get closer to the stars at the festival 's new berlinale talent campus , " a unique platform for aspiring young filmmakers from all over the world .

war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .
at the same time , u.s. secretary of state colin powell also requested to be interviewed by one of these stations , and a key adviser to the pentagon , richard perle , spoke out in a newspaper interview about the meaningless of schröder 's opposition .
chancellor 's stakes out position schröder 's opposition to a possible war on iraq took shape during the summer while he was campaigning for re-election .
taking a position that contrasted with his support of the 1999 war against yugoslavia , schröder pledged that german troops would not join any u.s.-led military campaign against saddam hussein .
last week , the chancellor went even further in his opposition , telling a campaign rally in his home state of lower saxony that germany would not support any security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
in his television interview with the ard network , schröder elaborated on the reasons for his opposition .
" the germans have had their own experiences with war , " he said .
" and that has left a deep mark on their collective conscience .
therefore , people have to understand that we - when faced with the question of war as a normal part of political options - have a position based on principle . "
the chancellor also expressed his disappointment with bush 's failure to present evidence earlier in the debate .
" i would have liked for intelligence information - from whatever source - to have been put on the table at the start of the process , " he said .
in the address , bush said he would send secretary of state colin powell to the united nations next wednesday to share intelligence on iraq .
administration officials said the data showed saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
powell seeks to sway germans powell , in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday , said he hoped the germans would change their minds after seeing the new information .
" we hope that in the next few days , when we discuss this together , the german public and its political leaders will look at everything in a different light , " powell said .
but key adviser to the pentagon richard perle suggested in an interview with a munich newspaper that schröder and the country he represents no longer mattered .
schröder has assumed " such an extreme position that he has taken germany and himself out of the debate , " perle told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" germany is irrelevant .
and it is not particularly easy for a german chancellor to make his country irrelevant . "
state of the union speech sparks criticism unlike schröder and fischer , who welcomed bush 's state of the union address , other members of the parties that form germany 's governing coalition proved more skeptical and voiced their criticism on wednesday .

at the pre-festival press conference this week , berlinale director dieter kosslick called to " shoot films , not people " . the possibility of a war in iraq has already thrown a shadow over germany 's most glamourous culture highlight , the berlinale film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it even influenced the selection of films for the annual festival competition , berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday - in the case of a war the festival would focus on political films and would hold daily discussions .
this year 's motto " towards tolerance " did not just refer to the mixture of " intelligent entertainment film and challenging cinema " , kosslick said , but also showed that a competition with international artists could be a peaceful affair . so far , however , this year 's berlinale is set to run as planned , and hopes to attract more than 100,000 visitors to berlin 's cinemas for ten days of the best and the newest in world cinema .
300 films will be on show , including 59 german productions , the highest number in the history of the festival .
in addition , three german films will be running for the golden bear , the berlinale film award , along with a further 19 movies . further highlights include a series of films starring legendary french actress anouk aimée , 26 world premiers , a selection of " artistically orientated contemporary film " – 52 films from 24 countries - , and a " lively overview of the results of world cinema in the past 12 months " featured in the berlinale panorama section : 17 films , 12 documentaries and 23 short films from 31 countries . in addition , this year 's berlinale will have a strong focus on short film , with a new separate short film festival hosting 57 films with which the berlinale hopes to direct the audience 's attention to " a medium , in which newcomers can prove and distinguish themselves . "
and an international children 's film festival will feature parallel to the berlinale , the largest in the history of the berlinale yet – a development which , according to thomas hailer , director of the children 's festival , proves how " films all over the world are showing more and more respect to children . " important for the film industry but the main attraction to the berlinale is due to be the entourage of stars in the german capital for the event .
although berlin may lack the glamour and style of film festival hosts venice and cannes , the sheer volume of visitors makes it one of the most important venues for the film business in the world . this year , numerous names from the film industry have announced their arrival in berlin for the festival , including directors spike lee , oliver stone , michael winterbottom and oskar roehler , and world famous actors kevin spacey , macaulay culkin , catherine zeta-jones and george cloony . and the public will have the chance to get closer to the stars at the festival 's new berlinale talent campus , " a unique platform for aspiring young filmmakers from all over the world . "
here , 500 young directors , producers and actors will sit down to topics concerning the making of a film with their more famous and experienced counterparts .
the results will then subsequently be presented to the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berlinale film festival 2003 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

at the pre-festival press conference this week , berlinale director dieter kosslick called to " shoot films , not people " . the possibility of a war in iraq has already thrown a shadow over germany 's most glamourous culture highlight , the berlinale film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it even influenced the selection of films for the annual festival competition , berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday - in the case of a war the festival would focus on political films and would hold daily discussions .
this year 's motto " towards tolerance " did not just refer to the mixture of " intelligent entertainment film and challenging cinema " , kosslick said , but also showed that a competition with international artists could be a peaceful affair . so far , however , this year 's berlinale is set to run as planned , and hopes to attract more than 100,000 visitors to berlin 's cinemas for ten days of the best and the newest in world cinema .
300 films will be on show , including 59 german productions , the highest number in the history of the festival .
in addition , three german films will be running for the golden bear , the berlinale film award , along with a further 19 movies . further highlights include a series of films starring legendary french actress anouk aimée , 26 world premiers , a selection of " artistically orientated contemporary film " – 52 films from 24 countries - , and a " lively overview of the results of world cinema in the past 12 months " featured in the berlinale panorama section : 17 films , 12 documentaries and 23 short films from 31 countries . in addition , this year 's berlinale will have a strong focus on short film , with a new separate short film festival hosting 57 films with which the berlinale hopes to direct the audience 's attention to " a medium , in which newcomers can prove and distinguish themselves . "
and an international children 's film festival will feature parallel to the berlinale , the largest in the history of the berlinale yet – a development which , according to thomas hailer , director of the children 's festival , proves how " films all over the world are showing more and more respect to children . " important for the film industry but the main attraction to the berlinale is due to be the entourage of stars in the german capital for the event .
although berlin may lack the glamour and style of film festival hosts venice and cannes , the sheer volume of visitors makes it one of the most important venues for the film business in the world . this year , numerous names from the film industry have announced their arrival in berlin for the festival , including directors spike lee , oliver stone , michael winterbottom and oskar roehler , and world famous actors kevin spacey , macaulay culkin , catherine zeta-jones and george cloony . and the public will have the chance to get closer to the stars at the festival 's new berlinale talent campus , " a unique platform for aspiring young filmmakers from all over the world . "
here , 500 young directors , producers and actors will sit down to topics concerning the making of a film with their more famous and experienced counterparts .

war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .
at the same time , u.s. secretary of state colin powell also requested to be interviewed by one of these stations , and a key adviser to the pentagon , richard perle , spoke out in a newspaper interview about the meaningless of schröder 's opposition .
chancellor 's stakes out position schröder 's opposition to a possible war on iraq took shape during the summer while he was campaigning for re-election .
taking a position that contrasted with his support of the 1999 war against yugoslavia , schröder pledged that german troops would not join any u.s.-led military campaign against saddam hussein .
last week , the chancellor went even further in his opposition , telling a campaign rally in his home state of lower saxony that germany would not support any security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
in his television interview with the ard network , schröder elaborated on the reasons for his opposition .
" the germans have had their own experiences with war , " he said .
" and that has left a deep mark on their collective conscience .
therefore , people have to understand that we - when faced with the question of war as a normal part of political options - have a position based on principle . "
the chancellor also expressed his disappointment with bush 's failure to present evidence earlier in the debate .
" i would have liked for intelligence information - from whatever source - to have been put on the table at the start of the process , " he said .
in the address , bush said he would send secretary of state colin powell to the united nations next wednesday to share intelligence on iraq .
administration officials said the data showed saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
powell seeks to sway germans powell , in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday , said he hoped the germans would change their minds after seeing the new information .
" we hope that in the next few days , when we discuss this together , the german public and its political leaders will look at everything in a different light , " powell said .
but key adviser to the pentagon richard perle suggested in an interview with a munich newspaper that schröder and the country he represents no longer mattered .
schröder has assumed " such an extreme position that he has taken germany and himself out of the debate , " perle told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" germany is irrelevant .
and it is not particularly easy for a german chancellor to make his country irrelevant . "
state of the union speech sparks criticism unlike schröder and fischer , who welcomed bush 's state of the union address , other members of the parties that form germany 's governing coalition proved more skeptical and voiced their criticism on wednesday .
gernot erler , the vice chairman of the social democratic group in the german parliament , said in a television interview , " it is clear that the american president actually does not want to end a program of weapons of mass destruction in iraq , but is dead set on waging war and is looking for justification for his action . "
erler and angelika beer , the co-leader of the junior coalition partner , the green party , also questioned bush 's motives for pledging to turn over more information to the security council .
" the question naturally arises : why was n't bush 's proof presented to the u.n. long ago ? "
beer said in an early morning radio interview .
erler said he doubted that bush actually wanted to work with the united nations .
" why is he withholding this supposed secret information and then planning to pull a rabbit out of his hat next week ? " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

back at home , satisfying his guests is more important than recognition . the talblick restaurant is a modest establishment , just a stone ’ s throw away from the local town church in wildberg , a spa town in the black forest with a population of 10,000 . but last year , its young chef won a prestigious international cooking award , making a new star out of the rustic country inn on germany 's culinary landscape . on thursday , weitbrecht added another feather into his hat , placing third at the international cooking competition bocuse d 'or . sturgeon specials claus weitbrecht completed cooking school in heidelberg in 1999 and expanded his culinary talents working for three star cooks in germany and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus weitbrecht bocuse d 'or the 29-year-old -lrb- photo -rrb- had already won numerous competitions when he was named the winner of the german bocuse d 'or competition in october last year after serving the jury his concoction “ miscellaneous from sturgeon with imperial caviar . ” in november 2002 he took over his parents ’ business , the restaurant talblick in wildberg .
as bocuse d ’ or german master he will cook for germany at the international competition in lyon , france that runs from january 27 - 30 . the golden bocuse the bocuse d ’ or takes its name from the eminent french chef paul bocuse , who established the competition in 1987 . what makes the bocuse d ’ or different from other culinary prizes is that competing chefs cook in front of an audience , so the public can see how much work it takes to make a fine meal .
the competition takes place each year during the culinary sector exhibition in lyon , bocuse ’ s hometown and one of the world ’ s capitals of fine cooking .
looking for the original so far german chefs won bronze medals in 1995 and 1997 .
if weitbrecht wins at the international competition in lyon , he will be the first german winner of the illustrious prize .
but it won ’ t be easy to outshine his competitors who represent 23 other countries . " you have to make something , that has never been made , ” weitbrecht explains .
“ and that ’ s very difficult in the kitchen because there are thousands of very good cooks , and they have all written very good cookbooks .
and then to find something that no one in the top-class jury has ever seen … .
the air gets thin at the top , it ’ s like in competitive sports . "
the specifications are the same for everyone : filet of beef bouchère , norwegian fjord trout and oxtail .
the chefs determine the side dishes themselves .
they have five hours to cook recipes that must be original , professional and tasty .

“ six months before the event takes place in lyon , the -lsb- norwegian -rsb- candidate starts training , so he will have cooked his dish at least 10 or 15 times racing the clock , under pressure . "
weitbrecht trains with his assistant , ludwig heer .

in the meantime , the postman comes , delivering a package from france : a kilo -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of fresh truffles .
they are for filling the trout at the competition . racing the clock over and over the chef and his assistant talk through the recipes , practicing until late in the night .
cutting and chopping , pureeing and garnishing , everything is measured with the stopwatch , since in lyon every minute counts .
ludwig heer is still dissatisfied : preparing the pastry takes too long .

as bocuse d ’ or german master he will cook for germany at the international competition in lyon , france that runs from january 27 - 30 . the golden bocuse the bocuse d ’ or takes its name from the eminent french chef paul bocuse , who established the competition in 1987 . what makes the bocuse d ’ or different from other culinary prizes is that competing chefs cook in front of an audience , so the public can see how much work it takes to make a fine meal .
the competition takes place each year during the culinary sector exhibition in lyon , bocuse ’ s hometown and one of the world ’ s capitals of fine cooking .
looking for the original so far german chefs won bronze medals in 1995 and 1997 .
if weitbrecht wins at the international competition in lyon , he will be the first german winner of the illustrious prize .
but it won ’ t be easy to outshine his competitors who represent 23 other countries . " you have to make something , that has never been made , ” weitbrecht explains .
“ and that ’ s very difficult in the kitchen because there are thousands of very good cooks , and they have all written very good cookbooks .
and then to find something that no one in the top-class jury has ever seen … .
the air gets thin at the top , it ’ s like in competitive sports . "
the specifications are the same for everyone : filet of beef bouchère , norwegian fjord trout and oxtail .
the chefs determine the side dishes themselves .
they have five hours to cook recipes that must be original , professional and tasty .
few people are aware of the costs and the effort that go into it . stiff competition " the scandinavian countries have sponsors and sponsors ’ funds at their disposal that germany can only dream of … .
the norwegians especially , they have € 500,000 – 600,000 with which they can do what they want , ” weitbrecht comments .
“ six months before the event takes place in lyon , the -lsb- norwegian -rsb- candidate starts training , so he will have cooked his dish at least 10 or 15 times racing the clock , under pressure . "
weitbrecht trains with his assistant , ludwig heer .
but he does it at the same time as living up to his daily responsibilities .
one guest orders viennese sausages with lentils , another orders schnitzel .
in the meantime , the postman comes , delivering a package from france : a kilo -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of fresh truffles .
they are for filling the trout at the competition . racing the clock over and over the chef and his assistant talk through the recipes , practicing until late in the night .
cutting and chopping , pureeing and garnishing , everything is measured with the stopwatch , since in lyon every minute counts .
ludwig heer is still dissatisfied : preparing the pastry takes too long .
" we 'll have to do it another five times , " he says , and then maybe we ’ ll make it . "
heer aims to cut the time down from the current 15:25 to 12:25 : " then it will work . "
at his restaurant in wildberg , claus weitbrecht makes three and five course meals , but only on those occasions when guests specifically order them .
otherwise , he cooks according to talblick ’ s menu .
he hopes that that will soon change , and that more customers will be enticed to take a seat at his restaurant just to sample his wares .
" my dream is that we will win something down there -lsb- in lyon -rsb- , and another dream is to have a michelin star sometime , ” he admits .
“ but the most important aspect is that the guests that come here leave the place satisfied .
it ’ s not worth cooking for a star at any price . ” günther birkenstock send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links bocuse d 'or 2003 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .
at the same time , u.s. secretary of state colin powell also requested to be interviewed by one of these stations , and a key adviser to the pentagon , richard perle , spoke out in a newspaper interview about the meaningless of schröder 's opposition .
chancellor 's stakes out position schröder 's opposition to a possible war on iraq took shape during the summer while he was campaigning for re-election .
taking a position that contrasted with his support of the 1999 war against yugoslavia , schröder pledged that german troops would not join any u.s.-led military campaign against saddam hussein .
last week , the chancellor went even further in his opposition , telling a campaign rally in his home state of lower saxony that germany would not support any security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
in his television interview with the ard network , schröder elaborated on the reasons for his opposition .
" the germans have had their own experiences with war , " he said .
" and that has left a deep mark on their collective conscience .
therefore , people have to understand that we - when faced with the question of war as a normal part of political options - have a position based on principle . "
the chancellor also expressed his disappointment with bush 's failure to present evidence earlier in the debate .
" i would have liked for intelligence information - from whatever source - to have been put on the table at the start of the process , " he said .
in the address , bush said he would send secretary of state colin powell to the united nations next wednesday to share intelligence on iraq .
administration officials said the data showed saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
powell seeks to sway germans powell , in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday , said he hoped the germans would change their minds after seeing the new information .
" we hope that in the next few days , when we discuss this together , the german public and its political leaders will look at everything in a different light , " powell said .
but key adviser to the pentagon richard perle suggested in an interview with a munich newspaper that schröder and the country he represents no longer mattered .
schröder has assumed " such an extreme position that he has taken germany and himself out of the debate , " perle told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" germany is irrelevant .
and it is not particularly easy for a german chancellor to make his country irrelevant . "
state of the union speech sparks criticism unlike schröder and fischer , who welcomed bush 's state of the union address , other members of the parties that form germany 's governing coalition proved more skeptical and voiced their criticism on wednesday .
gernot erler , the vice chairman of the social democratic group in the german parliament , said in a television interview , " it is clear that the american president actually does not want to end a program of weapons of mass destruction in iraq , but is dead set on waging war and is looking for justification for his action . "
erler and angelika beer , the co-leader of the junior coalition partner , the green party , also questioned bush 's motives for pledging to turn over more information to the security council .
" the question naturally arises : why was n't bush 's proof presented to the u.n. long ago ? "
beer said in an early morning radio interview .
erler said he doubted that bush actually wanted to work with the united nations .
" why is he withholding this supposed secret information and then planning to pull a rabbit out of his hat next week ? " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

back at home , satisfying his guests is more important than recognition . the talblick restaurant is a modest establishment , just a stone ’ s throw away from the local town church in wildberg , a spa town in the black forest with a population of 10,000 . but last year , its young chef won a prestigious international cooking award , making a new star out of the rustic country inn on germany 's culinary landscape . on thursday , weitbrecht added another feather into his hat , placing third at the international cooking competition bocuse d 'or . sturgeon specials claus weitbrecht completed cooking school in heidelberg in 1999 and expanded his culinary talents working for three star cooks in germany and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus weitbrecht bocuse d 'or the 29-year-old -lrb- photo -rrb- had already won numerous competitions when he was named the winner of the german bocuse d 'or competition in october last year after serving the jury his concoction “ miscellaneous from sturgeon with imperial caviar . ” in november 2002 he took over his parents ’ business , the restaurant talblick in wildberg .
as bocuse d ’ or german master he will cook for germany at the international competition in lyon , france that runs from january 27 - 30 . the golden bocuse the bocuse d ’ or takes its name from the eminent french chef paul bocuse , who established the competition in 1987 . what makes the bocuse d ’ or different from other culinary prizes is that competing chefs cook in front of an audience , so the public can see how much work it takes to make a fine meal .
the competition takes place each year during the culinary sector exhibition in lyon , bocuse ’ s hometown and one of the world ’ s capitals of fine cooking .
looking for the original so far german chefs won bronze medals in 1995 and 1997 .
if weitbrecht wins at the international competition in lyon , he will be the first german winner of the illustrious prize .
but it won ’ t be easy to outshine his competitors who represent 23 other countries . " you have to make something , that has never been made , ” weitbrecht explains .
“ and that ’ s very difficult in the kitchen because there are thousands of very good cooks , and they have all written very good cookbooks .
and then to find something that no one in the top-class jury has ever seen … .
the air gets thin at the top , it ’ s like in competitive sports . "
the specifications are the same for everyone : filet of beef bouchère , norwegian fjord trout and oxtail .
the chefs determine the side dishes themselves .
they have five hours to cook recipes that must be original , professional and tasty .
few people are aware of the costs and the effort that go into it . stiff competition " the scandinavian countries have sponsors and sponsors ’ funds at their disposal that germany can only dream of … .
the norwegians especially , they have € 500,000 – 600,000 with which they can do what they want , ” weitbrecht comments .
“ six months before the event takes place in lyon , the -lsb- norwegian -rsb- candidate starts training , so he will have cooked his dish at least 10 or 15 times racing the clock , under pressure . "
weitbrecht trains with his assistant , ludwig heer .
but he does it at the same time as living up to his daily responsibilities .
one guest orders viennese sausages with lentils , another orders schnitzel .
in the meantime , the postman comes , delivering a package from france : a kilo -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of fresh truffles .
they are for filling the trout at the competition . racing the clock over and over the chef and his assistant talk through the recipes , practicing until late in the night .
cutting and chopping , pureeing and garnishing , everything is measured with the stopwatch , since in lyon every minute counts .
ludwig heer is still dissatisfied : preparing the pastry takes too long .
" we 'll have to do it another five times , " he says , and then maybe we ’ ll make it . "
heer aims to cut the time down from the current 15:25 to 12:25 : " then it will work . "
at his restaurant in wildberg , claus weitbrecht makes three and five course meals , but only on those occasions when guests specifically order them .
otherwise , he cooks according to talblick ’ s menu .
he hopes that that will soon change , and that more customers will be enticed to take a seat at his restaurant just to sample his wares .
" my dream is that we will win something down there -lsb- in lyon -rsb- , and another dream is to have a michelin star sometime , ” he admits .

back at home , satisfying his guests is more important than recognition . the talblick restaurant is a modest establishment , just a stone ’ s throw away from the local town church in wildberg , a spa town in the black forest with a population of 10,000 . but last year , its young chef won a prestigious international cooking award , making a new star out of the rustic country inn on germany 's culinary landscape . on thursday , weitbrecht added another feather into his hat , placing third at the international cooking competition bocuse d 'or . sturgeon specials claus weitbrecht completed cooking school in heidelberg in 1999 and expanded his culinary talents working for three star cooks in germany and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus weitbrecht bocuse d 'or the 29-year-old -lrb- photo -rrb- had already won numerous competitions when he was named the winner of the german bocuse d 'or competition in october last year after serving the jury his concoction “ miscellaneous from sturgeon with imperial caviar . ” in november 2002 he took over his parents ’ business , the restaurant talblick in wildberg .
as bocuse d ’ or german master he will cook for germany at the international competition in lyon , france that runs from january 27 - 30 . the golden bocuse the bocuse d ’ or takes its name from the eminent french chef paul bocuse , who established the competition in 1987 . what makes the bocuse d ’ or different from other culinary prizes is that competing chefs cook in front of an audience , so the public can see how much work it takes to make a fine meal .
the competition takes place each year during the culinary sector exhibition in lyon , bocuse ’ s hometown and one of the world ’ s capitals of fine cooking .
looking for the original so far german chefs won bronze medals in 1995 and 1997 .
if weitbrecht wins at the international competition in lyon , he will be the first german winner of the illustrious prize .
but it won ’ t be easy to outshine his competitors who represent 23 other countries . " you have to make something , that has never been made , ” weitbrecht explains .
“ and that ’ s very difficult in the kitchen because there are thousands of very good cooks , and they have all written very good cookbooks .
and then to find something that no one in the top-class jury has ever seen … .
the air gets thin at the top , it ’ s like in competitive sports . "
the specifications are the same for everyone : filet of beef bouchère , norwegian fjord trout and oxtail .
the chefs determine the side dishes themselves .
they have five hours to cook recipes that must be original , professional and tasty .
few people are aware of the costs and the effort that go into it . stiff competition " the scandinavian countries have sponsors and sponsors ’ funds at their disposal that germany can only dream of … .
the norwegians especially , they have € 500,000 – 600,000 with which they can do what they want , ” weitbrecht comments .
“ six months before the event takes place in lyon , the -lsb- norwegian -rsb- candidate starts training , so he will have cooked his dish at least 10 or 15 times racing the clock , under pressure . "
weitbrecht trains with his assistant , ludwig heer .
but he does it at the same time as living up to his daily responsibilities .
one guest orders viennese sausages with lentils , another orders schnitzel .
in the meantime , the postman comes , delivering a package from france : a kilo -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of fresh truffles .
they are for filling the trout at the competition . racing the clock over and over the chef and his assistant talk through the recipes , practicing until late in the night .
cutting and chopping , pureeing and garnishing , everything is measured with the stopwatch , since in lyon every minute counts .
ludwig heer is still dissatisfied : preparing the pastry takes too long .
" we 'll have to do it another five times , " he says , and then maybe we ’ ll make it . "
heer aims to cut the time down from the current 15:25 to 12:25 : " then it will work . "
at his restaurant in wildberg , claus weitbrecht makes three and five course meals , but only on those occasions when guests specifically order them .
otherwise , he cooks according to talblick ’ s menu .
he hopes that that will soon change , and that more customers will be enticed to take a seat at his restaurant just to sample his wares .
" my dream is that we will win something down there -lsb- in lyon -rsb- , and another dream is to have a michelin star sometime , ” he admits .
“ but the most important aspect is that the guests that come here leave the place satisfied .
it ’ s not worth cooking for a star at any price . ” günther birkenstock send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links bocuse d 'or 2003 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

at the pre-festival press conference this week , berlinale director dieter kosslick called to " shoot films , not people " . the possibility of a war in iraq has already thrown a shadow over germany 's most glamourous culture highlight , the berlinale film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it even influenced the selection of films for the annual festival competition , berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday - in the case of a war the festival would focus on political films and would hold daily discussions .
this year 's motto " towards tolerance " did not just refer to the mixture of " intelligent entertainment film and challenging cinema " , kosslick said , but also showed that a competition with international artists could be a peaceful affair . so far , however , this year 's berlinale is set to run as planned , and hopes to attract more than 100,000 visitors to berlin 's cinemas for ten days of the best and the newest in world cinema .
300 films will be on show , including 59 german productions , the highest number in the history of the festival .
in addition , three german films will be running for the golden bear , the berlinale film award , along with a further 19 movies . further highlights include a series of films starring legendary french actress anouk aimée , 26 world premiers , a selection of " artistically orientated contemporary film " – 52 films from 24 countries - , and a " lively overview of the results of world cinema in the past 12 months " featured in the berlinale panorama section : 17 films , 12 documentaries and 23 short films from 31 countries . in addition , this year 's berlinale will have a strong focus on short film , with a new separate short film festival hosting 57 films with which the berlinale hopes to direct the audience 's attention to " a medium , in which newcomers can prove and distinguish themselves . "
and an international children 's film festival will feature parallel to the berlinale , the largest in the history of the berlinale yet – a development which , according to thomas hailer , director of the children 's festival , proves how " films all over the world are showing more and more respect to children . " important for the film industry but the main attraction to the berlinale is due to be the entourage of stars in the german capital for the event .
although berlin may lack the glamour and style of film festival hosts venice and cannes , the sheer volume of visitors makes it one of the most important venues for the film business in the world . this year , numerous names from the film industry have announced their arrival in berlin for the festival , including directors spike lee , oliver stone , michael winterbottom and oskar roehler , and world famous actors kevin spacey , macaulay culkin , catherine zeta-jones and george cloony . and the public will have the chance to get closer to the stars at the festival 's new berlinale talent campus , " a unique platform for aspiring young filmmakers from all over the world .

back at home , satisfying his guests is more important than recognition . the talblick restaurant is a modest establishment , just a stone ’ s throw away from the local town church in wildberg , a spa town in the black forest with a population of 10,000 . but last year , its young chef won a prestigious international cooking award , making a new star out of the rustic country inn on germany 's culinary landscape . on thursday , weitbrecht added another feather into his hat , placing third at the international cooking competition bocuse d 'or . sturgeon specials claus weitbrecht completed cooking school in heidelberg in 1999 and expanded his culinary talents working for three star cooks in germany and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus weitbrecht bocuse d 'or the 29-year-old -lrb- photo -rrb- had already won numerous competitions when he was named the winner of the german bocuse d 'or competition in october last year after serving the jury his concoction “ miscellaneous from sturgeon with imperial caviar . ” in november 2002 he took over his parents ’ business , the restaurant talblick in wildberg .
as bocuse d ’ or german master he will cook for germany at the international competition in lyon , france that runs from january 27 - 30 . the golden bocuse the bocuse d ’ or takes its name from the eminent french chef paul bocuse , who established the competition in 1987 . what makes the bocuse d ’ or different from other culinary prizes is that competing chefs cook in front of an audience , so the public can see how much work it takes to make a fine meal .
the competition takes place each year during the culinary sector exhibition in lyon , bocuse ’ s hometown and one of the world ’ s capitals of fine cooking .
looking for the original so far german chefs won bronze medals in 1995 and 1997 .
if weitbrecht wins at the international competition in lyon , he will be the first german winner of the illustrious prize .
but it won ’ t be easy to outshine his competitors who represent 23 other countries . " you have to make something , that has never been made , ” weitbrecht explains .
“ and that ’ s very difficult in the kitchen because there are thousands of very good cooks , and they have all written very good cookbooks .
and then to find something that no one in the top-class jury has ever seen … .
the air gets thin at the top , it ’ s like in competitive sports . "
the specifications are the same for everyone : filet of beef bouchère , norwegian fjord trout and oxtail .
the chefs determine the side dishes themselves .
they have five hours to cook recipes that must be original , professional and tasty .
few people are aware of the costs and the effort that go into it . stiff competition " the scandinavian countries have sponsors and sponsors ’ funds at their disposal that germany can only dream of … .
the norwegians especially , they have € 500,000 – 600,000 with which they can do what they want , ” weitbrecht comments .
“ six months before the event takes place in lyon , the -lsb- norwegian -rsb- candidate starts training , so he will have cooked his dish at least 10 or 15 times racing the clock , under pressure . "
weitbrecht trains with his assistant , ludwig heer .
but he does it at the same time as living up to his daily responsibilities .
one guest orders viennese sausages with lentils , another orders schnitzel .
in the meantime , the postman comes , delivering a package from france : a kilo -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of fresh truffles .
they are for filling the trout at the competition . racing the clock over and over the chef and his assistant talk through the recipes , practicing until late in the night .
cutting and chopping , pureeing and garnishing , everything is measured with the stopwatch , since in lyon every minute counts .
ludwig heer is still dissatisfied : preparing the pastry takes too long .
" we 'll have to do it another five times , " he says , and then maybe we ’ ll make it . "
heer aims to cut the time down from the current 15:25 to 12:25 : " then it will work . "
at his restaurant in wildberg , claus weitbrecht makes three and five course meals , but only on those occasions when guests specifically order them .
otherwise , he cooks according to talblick ’ s menu .
he hopes that that will soon change , and that more customers will be enticed to take a seat at his restaurant just to sample his wares .
" my dream is that we will win something down there -lsb- in lyon -rsb- , and another dream is to have a michelin star sometime , ” he admits .

300 films will be on show , including 59 german productions , the highest number in the history of the festival .
in addition , three german films will be running for the golden bear , the berlinale film award , along with a further 19 movies . further highlights include a series of films starring legendary french actress anouk aimée , 26 world premiers , a selection of " artistically orientated contemporary film " – 52 films from 24 countries - , and a " lively overview of the results of world cinema in the past 12 months " featured in the berlinale panorama section : 17 films , 12 documentaries and 23 short films from 31 countries . in addition , this year 's berlinale will have a strong focus on short film , with a new separate short film festival hosting 57 films with which the berlinale hopes to direct the audience 's attention to " a medium , in which newcomers can prove and distinguish themselves . "
and an international children 's film festival will feature parallel to the berlinale , the largest in the history of the berlinale yet – a development which , according to thomas hailer , director of the children 's festival , proves how " films all over the world are showing more and more respect to children . " important for the film industry but the main attraction to the berlinale is due to be the entourage of stars in the german capital for the event .
although berlin may lack the glamour and style of film festival hosts venice and cannes , the sheer volume of visitors makes it one of the most important venues for the film business in the world . this year , numerous names from the film industry have announced their arrival in berlin for the festival , including directors spike lee , oliver stone , michael winterbottom and oskar roehler , and world famous actors kevin spacey , macaulay culkin , catherine zeta-jones and george cloony . and the public will have the chance to get closer to the stars at the festival 's new berlinale talent campus , " a unique platform for aspiring young filmmakers from all over the world . "
here , 500 young directors , producers and actors will sit down to topics concerning the making of a film with their more famous and experienced counterparts .

war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .
at the same time , u.s. secretary of state colin powell also requested to be interviewed by one of these stations , and a key adviser to the pentagon , richard perle , spoke out in a newspaper interview about the meaningless of schröder 's opposition .
chancellor 's stakes out position schröder 's opposition to a possible war on iraq took shape during the summer while he was campaigning for re-election .
taking a position that contrasted with his support of the 1999 war against yugoslavia , schröder pledged that german troops would not join any u.s.-led military campaign against saddam hussein .
last week , the chancellor went even further in his opposition , telling a campaign rally in his home state of lower saxony that germany would not support any security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
in his television interview with the ard network , schröder elaborated on the reasons for his opposition .
" the germans have had their own experiences with war , " he said .
" and that has left a deep mark on their collective conscience .
therefore , people have to understand that we - when faced with the question of war as a normal part of political options - have a position based on principle . "
the chancellor also expressed his disappointment with bush 's failure to present evidence earlier in the debate .
" i would have liked for intelligence information - from whatever source - to have been put on the table at the start of the process , " he said .
in the address , bush said he would send secretary of state colin powell to the united nations next wednesday to share intelligence on iraq .
administration officials said the data showed saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
powell seeks to sway germans powell , in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday , said he hoped the germans would change their minds after seeing the new information .
" we hope that in the next few days , when we discuss this together , the german public and its political leaders will look at everything in a different light , " powell said .
but key adviser to the pentagon richard perle suggested in an interview with a munich newspaper that schröder and the country he represents no longer mattered .
schröder has assumed " such an extreme position that he has taken germany and himself out of the debate , " perle told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" germany is irrelevant .
and it is not particularly easy for a german chancellor to make his country irrelevant . "
state of the union speech sparks criticism unlike schröder and fischer , who welcomed bush 's state of the union address , other members of the parties that form germany 's governing coalition proved more skeptical and voiced their criticism on wednesday .
gernot erler , the vice chairman of the social democratic group in the german parliament , said in a television interview , " it is clear that the american president actually does not want to end a program of weapons of mass destruction in iraq , but is dead set on waging war and is looking for justification for his action . "
erler and angelika beer , the co-leader of the junior coalition partner , the green party , also questioned bush 's motives for pledging to turn over more information to the security council .
" the question naturally arises : why was n't bush 's proof presented to the u.n. long ago ? "
beer said in an early morning radio interview .
erler said he doubted that bush actually wanted to work with the united nations .
" why is he withholding this supposed secret information and then planning to pull a rabbit out of his hat next week ? " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : glitz and glamour at berlinale strong german cast for berlin film festival berlinale log : wladimir kaminer on the state of foreign film berlinale log : festival gets into gere berlinale log : more stars , less show culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.01.2003 " shoot films , not people " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlinale is expected to attract more than 100 000 visitors to berlin the annual glitter at this year 's berlinale film festival may be overshadowed by a war on iraq .
at the pre-festival press conference this week , berlinale director dieter kosslick called to " shoot films , not people " . the possibility of a war in iraq has already thrown a shadow over germany 's most glamourous culture highlight , the berlinale film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it even influenced the selection of films for the annual festival competition , berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday - in the case of a war the festival would focus on political films and would hold daily discussions .
this year 's motto " towards tolerance " did not just refer to the mixture of " intelligent entertainment film and challenging cinema " , kosslick said , but also showed that a competition with international artists could be a peaceful affair . so far , however , this year 's berlinale is set to run as planned , and hopes to attract more than 100,000 visitors to berlin 's cinemas for ten days of the best and the newest in world cinema .
300 films will be on show , including 59 german productions , the highest number in the history of the festival .
in addition , three german films will be running for the golden bear , the berlinale film award , along with a further 19 movies . further highlights include a series of films starring legendary french actress anouk aimée , 26 world premiers , a selection of " artistically orientated contemporary film " – 52 films from 24 countries - , and a " lively overview of the results of world cinema in the past 12 months " featured in the berlinale panorama section : 17 films , 12 documentaries and 23 short films from 31 countries . in addition , this year 's berlinale will have a strong focus on short film , with a new separate short film festival hosting 57 films with which the berlinale hopes to direct the audience 's attention to " a medium , in which newcomers can prove and distinguish themselves . "
and an international children 's film festival will feature parallel to the berlinale , the largest in the history of the berlinale yet – a development which , according to thomas hailer , director of the children 's festival , proves how " films all over the world are showing more and more respect to children . " important for the film industry but the main attraction to the berlinale is due to be the entourage of stars in the german capital for the event .
although berlin may lack the glamour and style of film festival hosts venice and cannes , the sheer volume of visitors makes it one of the most important venues for the film business in the world . this year , numerous names from the film industry have announced their arrival in berlin for the festival , including directors spike lee , oliver stone , michael winterbottom and oskar roehler , and world famous actors kevin spacey , macaulay culkin , catherine zeta-jones and george cloony . and the public will have the chance to get closer to the stars at the festival 's new berlinale talent campus , " a unique platform for aspiring young filmmakers from all over the world . "
here , 500 young directors , producers and actors will sit down to topics concerning the making of a film with their more famous and experienced counterparts .
the results will then subsequently be presented to the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berlinale film festival 2003 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.01.2003 schröder remains opposed to war on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against a war in iraq continued in germany this week chancellor gerhard schröder says he is unlikely to change his views on a war in iraq - no matter what information the u.s. has on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .
at the same time , u.s. secretary of state colin powell also requested to be interviewed by one of these stations , and a key adviser to the pentagon , richard perle , spoke out in a newspaper interview about the meaningless of schröder 's opposition .
chancellor 's stakes out position schröder 's opposition to a possible war on iraq took shape during the summer while he was campaigning for re-election .
taking a position that contrasted with his support of the 1999 war against yugoslavia , schröder pledged that german troops would not join any u.s.-led military campaign against saddam hussein .
last week , the chancellor went even further in his opposition , telling a campaign rally in his home state of lower saxony that germany would not support any security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
in his television interview with the ard network , schröder elaborated on the reasons for his opposition .
" the germans have had their own experiences with war , " he said .
" and that has left a deep mark on their collective conscience .
therefore , people have to understand that we - when faced with the question of war as a normal part of political options - have a position based on principle . "
the chancellor also expressed his disappointment with bush 's failure to present evidence earlier in the debate .
" i would have liked for intelligence information - from whatever source - to have been put on the table at the start of the process , " he said .
in the address , bush said he would send secretary of state colin powell to the united nations next wednesday to share intelligence on iraq .
administration officials said the data showed saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
powell seeks to sway germans powell , in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday , said he hoped the germans would change their minds after seeing the new information .
" we hope that in the next few days , when we discuss this together , the german public and its political leaders will look at everything in a different light , " powell said .
but key adviser to the pentagon richard perle suggested in an interview with a munich newspaper that schröder and the country he represents no longer mattered .
schröder has assumed " such an extreme position that he has taken germany and himself out of the debate , " perle told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" germany is irrelevant .
and it is not particularly easy for a german chancellor to make his country irrelevant . "
state of the union speech sparks criticism unlike schröder and fischer , who welcomed bush 's state of the union address , other members of the parties that form germany 's governing coalition proved more skeptical and voiced their criticism on wednesday .
gernot erler , the vice chairman of the social democratic group in the german parliament , said in a television interview , " it is clear that the american president actually does not want to end a program of weapons of mass destruction in iraq , but is dead set on waging war and is looking for justification for his action . "
erler and angelika beer , the co-leader of the junior coalition partner , the green party , also questioned bush 's motives for pledging to turn over more information to the security council .
" the question naturally arises : why was n't bush 's proof presented to the u.n. long ago ? "
beer said in an early morning radio interview .
erler said he doubted that bush actually wanted to work with the united nations .
" why is he withholding this supposed secret information and then planning to pull a rabbit out of his hat next week ? " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

although berlin may lack the glamour and style of film festival hosts venice and cannes , the sheer volume of visitors makes it one of the most important venues for the film business in the world . this year , numerous names from the film industry have announced their arrival in berlin for the festival , including directors spike lee , oliver stone , michael winterbottom and oskar roehler , and world famous actors kevin spacey , macaulay culkin , catherine zeta-jones and george cloony . and the public will have the chance to get closer to the stars at the festival 's new berlinale talent campus , " a unique platform for aspiring young filmmakers from all over the world .

back at home , satisfying his guests is more important than recognition . the talblick restaurant is a modest establishment , just a stone ’ s throw away from the local town church in wildberg , a spa town in the black forest with a population of 10,000 . but last year , its young chef won a prestigious international cooking award , making a new star out of the rustic country inn on germany 's culinary landscape . on thursday , weitbrecht added another feather into his hat , placing third at the international cooking competition bocuse d 'or . sturgeon specials claus weitbrecht completed cooking school in heidelberg in 1999 and expanded his culinary talents working for three star cooks in germany and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus weitbrecht bocuse d 'or the 29-year-old -lrb- photo -rrb- had already won numerous competitions when he was named the winner of the german bocuse d 'or competition in october last year after serving the jury his concoction “ miscellaneous from sturgeon with imperial caviar . ” in november 2002 he took over his parents ’ business , the restaurant talblick in wildberg .
as bocuse d ’ or german master he will cook for germany at the international competition in lyon , france that runs from january 27 - 30 . the golden bocuse the bocuse d ’ or takes its name from the eminent french chef paul bocuse , who established the competition in 1987 . what makes the bocuse d ’ or different from other culinary prizes is that competing chefs cook in front of an audience , so the public can see how much work it takes to make a fine meal .
the competition takes place each year during the culinary sector exhibition in lyon , bocuse ’ s hometown and one of the world ’ s capitals of fine cooking .
looking for the original so far german chefs won bronze medals in 1995 and 1997 .
if weitbrecht wins at the international competition in lyon , he will be the first german winner of the illustrious prize .
but it won ’ t be easy to outshine his competitors who represent 23 other countries . " you have to make something , that has never been made , ” weitbrecht explains .
“ and that ’ s very difficult in the kitchen because there are thousands of very good cooks , and they have all written very good cookbooks .
and then to find something that no one in the top-class jury has ever seen … .
the air gets thin at the top , it ’ s like in competitive sports . "
the specifications are the same for everyone : filet of beef bouchère , norwegian fjord trout and oxtail .
the chefs determine the side dishes themselves .
they have five hours to cook recipes that must be original , professional and tasty .
few people are aware of the costs and the effort that go into it . stiff competition " the scandinavian countries have sponsors and sponsors ’ funds at their disposal that germany can only dream of … .
the norwegians especially , they have € 500,000 – 600,000 with which they can do what they want , ” weitbrecht comments .
“ six months before the event takes place in lyon , the -lsb- norwegian -rsb- candidate starts training , so he will have cooked his dish at least 10 or 15 times racing the clock , under pressure . "
weitbrecht trains with his assistant , ludwig heer .
but he does it at the same time as living up to his daily responsibilities .
one guest orders viennese sausages with lentils , another orders schnitzel .
in the meantime , the postman comes , delivering a package from france : a kilo -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of fresh truffles .
they are for filling the trout at the competition . racing the clock over and over the chef and his assistant talk through the recipes , practicing until late in the night .
cutting and chopping , pureeing and garnishing , everything is measured with the stopwatch , since in lyon every minute counts .
ludwig heer is still dissatisfied : preparing the pastry takes too long .
" we 'll have to do it another five times , " he says , and then maybe we ’ ll make it . "
heer aims to cut the time down from the current 15:25 to 12:25 : " then it will work . "
at his restaurant in wildberg , claus weitbrecht makes three and five course meals , but only on those occasions when guests specifically order them .
otherwise , he cooks according to talblick ’ s menu .
he hopes that that will soon change , and that more customers will be enticed to take a seat at his restaurant just to sample his wares .
" my dream is that we will win something down there -lsb- in lyon -rsb- , and another dream is to have a michelin star sometime , ” he admits .
“ but the most important aspect is that the guests that come here leave the place satisfied .
it ’ s not worth cooking for a star at any price . ” günther birkenstock send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links bocuse d 'or 2003 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .
at the same time , u.s. secretary of state colin powell also requested to be interviewed by one of these stations , and a key adviser to the pentagon , richard perle , spoke out in a newspaper interview about the meaningless of schröder 's opposition .
chancellor 's stakes out position schröder 's opposition to a possible war on iraq took shape during the summer while he was campaigning for re-election .
taking a position that contrasted with his support of the 1999 war against yugoslavia , schröder pledged that german troops would not join any u.s.-led military campaign against saddam hussein .
last week , the chancellor went even further in his opposition , telling a campaign rally in his home state of lower saxony that germany would not support any security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
in his television interview with the ard network , schröder elaborated on the reasons for his opposition .
" the germans have had their own experiences with war , " he said .
" and that has left a deep mark on their collective conscience .
therefore , people have to understand that we - when faced with the question of war as a normal part of political options - have a position based on principle . "
the chancellor also expressed his disappointment with bush 's failure to present evidence earlier in the debate .
" i would have liked for intelligence information - from whatever source - to have been put on the table at the start of the process , " he said .
in the address , bush said he would send secretary of state colin powell to the united nations next wednesday to share intelligence on iraq .
administration officials said the data showed saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
powell seeks to sway germans powell , in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday , said he hoped the germans would change their minds after seeing the new information .
" we hope that in the next few days , when we discuss this together , the german public and its political leaders will look at everything in a different light , " powell said .
but key adviser to the pentagon richard perle suggested in an interview with a munich newspaper that schröder and the country he represents no longer mattered .
schröder has assumed " such an extreme position that he has taken germany and himself out of the debate , " perle told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" germany is irrelevant .
and it is not particularly easy for a german chancellor to make his country irrelevant . "
state of the union speech sparks criticism unlike schröder and fischer , who welcomed bush 's state of the union address , other members of the parties that form germany 's governing coalition proved more skeptical and voiced their criticism on wednesday .
gernot erler , the vice chairman of the social democratic group in the german parliament , said in a television interview , " it is clear that the american president actually does not want to end a program of weapons of mass destruction in iraq , but is dead set on waging war and is looking for justification for his action . "
erler and angelika beer , the co-leader of the junior coalition partner , the green party , also questioned bush 's motives for pledging to turn over more information to the security council .
" the question naturally arises : why was n't bush 's proof presented to the u.n. long ago ? "
beer said in an early morning radio interview .
erler said he doubted that bush actually wanted to work with the united nations .
" why is he withholding this supposed secret information and then planning to pull a rabbit out of his hat next week ? " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

back at home , satisfying his guests is more important than recognition . the talblick restaurant is a modest establishment , just a stone ’ s throw away from the local town church in wildberg , a spa town in the black forest with a population of 10,000 . but last year , its young chef won a prestigious international cooking award , making a new star out of the rustic country inn on germany 's culinary landscape . on thursday , weitbrecht added another feather into his hat , placing third at the international cooking competition bocuse d 'or . sturgeon specials claus weitbrecht completed cooking school in heidelberg in 1999 and expanded his culinary talents working for three star cooks in germany and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus weitbrecht bocuse d 'or the 29-year-old -lrb- photo -rrb- had already won numerous competitions when he was named the winner of the german bocuse d 'or competition in october last year after serving the jury his concoction “ miscellaneous from sturgeon with imperial caviar . ” in november 2002 he took over his parents ’ business , the restaurant talblick in wildberg .
as bocuse d ’ or german master he will cook for germany at the international competition in lyon , france that runs from january 27 - 30 . the golden bocuse the bocuse d ’ or takes its name from the eminent french chef paul bocuse , who established the competition in 1987 . what makes the bocuse d ’ or different from other culinary prizes is that competing chefs cook in front of an audience , so the public can see how much work it takes to make a fine meal .
the competition takes place each year during the culinary sector exhibition in lyon , bocuse ’ s hometown and one of the world ’ s capitals of fine cooking .
looking for the original so far german chefs won bronze medals in 1995 and 1997 .
if weitbrecht wins at the international competition in lyon , he will be the first german winner of the illustrious prize .
but it won ’ t be easy to outshine his competitors who represent 23 other countries . " you have to make something , that has never been made , ” weitbrecht explains .
“ and that ’ s very difficult in the kitchen because there are thousands of very good cooks , and they have all written very good cookbooks .
and then to find something that no one in the top-class jury has ever seen … .
the air gets thin at the top , it ’ s like in competitive sports . "
the specifications are the same for everyone : filet of beef bouchère , norwegian fjord trout and oxtail .
the chefs determine the side dishes themselves .
they have five hours to cook recipes that must be original , professional and tasty .
few people are aware of the costs and the effort that go into it . stiff competition " the scandinavian countries have sponsors and sponsors ’ funds at their disposal that germany can only dream of … .
the norwegians especially , they have € 500,000 – 600,000 with which they can do what they want , ” weitbrecht comments .
“ six months before the event takes place in lyon , the -lsb- norwegian -rsb- candidate starts training , so he will have cooked his dish at least 10 or 15 times racing the clock , under pressure . "
weitbrecht trains with his assistant , ludwig heer .
but he does it at the same time as living up to his daily responsibilities .
one guest orders viennese sausages with lentils , another orders schnitzel .
in the meantime , the postman comes , delivering a package from france : a kilo -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of fresh truffles .
they are for filling the trout at the competition . racing the clock over and over the chef and his assistant talk through the recipes , practicing until late in the night .
cutting and chopping , pureeing and garnishing , everything is measured with the stopwatch , since in lyon every minute counts .
ludwig heer is still dissatisfied : preparing the pastry takes too long .
" we 'll have to do it another five times , " he says , and then maybe we ’ ll make it . "
heer aims to cut the time down from the current 15:25 to 12:25 : " then it will work . "
at his restaurant in wildberg , claus weitbrecht makes three and five course meals , but only on those occasions when guests specifically order them .
otherwise , he cooks according to talblick ’ s menu .
he hopes that that will soon change , and that more customers will be enticed to take a seat at his restaurant just to sample his wares .
" my dream is that we will win something down there -lsb- in lyon -rsb- , and another dream is to have a michelin star sometime , ” he admits .

at the pre-festival press conference this week , berlinale director dieter kosslick called to " shoot films , not people " . the possibility of a war in iraq has already thrown a shadow over germany 's most glamourous culture highlight , the berlinale film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it even influenced the selection of films for the annual festival competition , berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday - in the case of a war the festival would focus on political films and would hold daily discussions .
this year 's motto " towards tolerance " did not just refer to the mixture of " intelligent entertainment film and challenging cinema " , kosslick said , but also showed that a competition with international artists could be a peaceful affair . so far , however , this year 's berlinale is set to run as planned , and hopes to attract more than 100,000 visitors to berlin 's cinemas for ten days of the best and the newest in world cinema .
300 films will be on show , including 59 german productions , the highest number in the history of the festival .
in addition , three german films will be running for the golden bear , the berlinale film award , along with a further 19 movies . further highlights include a series of films starring legendary french actress anouk aimée , 26 world premiers , a selection of " artistically orientated contemporary film " – 52 films from 24 countries - , and a " lively overview of the results of world cinema in the past 12 months " featured in the berlinale panorama section : 17 films , 12 documentaries and 23 short films from 31 countries . in addition , this year 's berlinale will have a strong focus on short film , with a new separate short film festival hosting 57 films with which the berlinale hopes to direct the audience 's attention to " a medium , in which newcomers can prove and distinguish themselves . "
and an international children 's film festival will feature parallel to the berlinale , the largest in the history of the berlinale yet – a development which , according to thomas hailer , director of the children 's festival , proves how " films all over the world are showing more and more respect to children . " important for the film industry but the main attraction to the berlinale is due to be the entourage of stars in the german capital for the event .
although berlin may lack the glamour and style of film festival hosts venice and cannes , the sheer volume of visitors makes it one of the most important venues for the film business in the world . this year , numerous names from the film industry have announced their arrival in berlin for the festival , including directors spike lee , oliver stone , michael winterbottom and oskar roehler , and world famous actors kevin spacey , macaulay culkin , catherine zeta-jones and george cloony . and the public will have the chance to get closer to the stars at the festival 's new berlinale talent campus , " a unique platform for aspiring young filmmakers from all over the world . "
here , 500 young directors , producers and actors will sit down to topics concerning the making of a film with their more famous and experienced counterparts .
the results will then subsequently be presented to the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berlinale film festival 2003 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

at the pre-festival press conference this week , berlinale director dieter kosslick called to " shoot films , not people " . the possibility of a war in iraq has already thrown a shadow over germany 's most glamourous culture highlight , the berlinale film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it even influenced the selection of films for the annual festival competition , berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday - in the case of a war the festival would focus on political films and would hold daily discussions .
this year 's motto " towards tolerance " did not just refer to the mixture of " intelligent entertainment film and challenging cinema " , kosslick said , but also showed that a competition with international artists could be a peaceful affair . so far , however , this year 's berlinale is set to run as planned , and hopes to attract more than 100,000 visitors to berlin 's cinemas for ten days of the best and the newest in world cinema .
300 films will be on show , including 59 german productions , the highest number in the history of the festival .
in addition , three german films will be running for the golden bear , the berlinale film award , along with a further 19 movies . further highlights include a series of films starring legendary french actress anouk aimée , 26 world premiers , a selection of " artistically orientated contemporary film " – 52 films from 24 countries - , and a " lively overview of the results of world cinema in the past 12 months " featured in the berlinale panorama section : 17 films , 12 documentaries and 23 short films from 31 countries . in addition , this year 's berlinale will have a strong focus on short film , with a new separate short film festival hosting 57 films with which the berlinale hopes to direct the audience 's attention to " a medium , in which newcomers can prove and distinguish themselves .

" important for the film industry but the main attraction to the berlinale is due to be the entourage of stars in the german capital for the event .
although berlin may lack the glamour and style of film festival hosts venice and cannes , the sheer volume of visitors makes it one of the most important venues for the film business in the world . this year , numerous names from the film industry have announced their arrival in berlin for the festival , including directors spike lee , oliver stone , michael winterbottom and oskar roehler , and world famous actors kevin spacey , macaulay culkin , catherine zeta-jones and george cloony . and the public will have the chance to get closer to the stars at the festival 's new berlinale talent campus , " a unique platform for aspiring young filmmakers from all over the world .

war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .
at the same time , u.s. secretary of state colin powell also requested to be interviewed by one of these stations , and a key adviser to the pentagon , richard perle , spoke out in a newspaper interview about the meaningless of schröder 's opposition .
chancellor 's stakes out position schröder 's opposition to a possible war on iraq took shape during the summer while he was campaigning for re-election .
taking a position that contrasted with his support of the 1999 war against yugoslavia , schröder pledged that german troops would not join any u.s.-led military campaign against saddam hussein .
last week , the chancellor went even further in his opposition , telling a campaign rally in his home state of lower saxony that germany would not support any security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
in his television interview with the ard network , schröder elaborated on the reasons for his opposition .
" the germans have had their own experiences with war , " he said .
" and that has left a deep mark on their collective conscience .
therefore , people have to understand that we - when faced with the question of war as a normal part of political options - have a position based on principle . "
the chancellor also expressed his disappointment with bush 's failure to present evidence earlier in the debate .
" i would have liked for intelligence information - from whatever source - to have been put on the table at the start of the process , " he said .
in the address , bush said he would send secretary of state colin powell to the united nations next wednesday to share intelligence on iraq .
administration officials said the data showed saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
powell seeks to sway germans powell , in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday , said he hoped the germans would change their minds after seeing the new information .
" we hope that in the next few days , when we discuss this together , the german public and its political leaders will look at everything in a different light , " powell said .
but key adviser to the pentagon richard perle suggested in an interview with a munich newspaper that schröder and the country he represents no longer mattered .
schröder has assumed " such an extreme position that he has taken germany and himself out of the debate , " perle told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" germany is irrelevant .
and it is not particularly easy for a german chancellor to make his country irrelevant . "
state of the union speech sparks criticism unlike schröder and fischer , who welcomed bush 's state of the union address , other members of the parties that form germany 's governing coalition proved more skeptical and voiced their criticism on wednesday .
gernot erler , the vice chairman of the social democratic group in the german parliament , said in a television interview , " it is clear that the american president actually does not want to end a program of weapons of mass destruction in iraq , but is dead set on waging war and is looking for justification for his action . "
erler and angelika beer , the co-leader of the junior coalition partner , the green party , also questioned bush 's motives for pledging to turn over more information to the security council .
" the question naturally arises : why was n't bush 's proof presented to the u.n. long ago ? "
beer said in an early morning radio interview .
erler said he doubted that bush actually wanted to work with the united nations .

at the pre-festival press conference this week , berlinale director dieter kosslick called to " shoot films , not people " . the possibility of a war in iraq has already thrown a shadow over germany 's most glamourous culture highlight , the berlinale film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it even influenced the selection of films for the annual festival competition , berlinale director dieter kosslick -lrb- photo -rrb- said on tuesday - in the case of a war the festival would focus on political films and would hold daily discussions .
this year 's motto " towards tolerance " did not just refer to the mixture of " intelligent entertainment film and challenging cinema " , kosslick said , but also showed that a competition with international artists could be a peaceful affair . so far , however , this year 's berlinale is set to run as planned , and hopes to attract more than 100,000 visitors to berlin 's cinemas for ten days of the best and the newest in world cinema .
300 films will be on show , including 59 german productions , the highest number in the history of the festival .
in addition , three german films will be running for the golden bear , the berlinale film award , along with a further 19 movies . further highlights include a series of films starring legendary french actress anouk aimée , 26 world premiers , a selection of " artistically orientated contemporary film " – 52 films from 24 countries - , and a " lively overview of the results of world cinema in the past 12 months " featured in the berlinale panorama section : 17 films , 12 documentaries and 23 short films from 31 countries . in addition , this year 's berlinale will have a strong focus on short film , with a new separate short film festival hosting 57 films with which the berlinale hopes to direct the audience 's attention to " a medium , in which newcomers can prove and distinguish themselves . "
and an international children 's film festival will feature parallel to the berlinale , the largest in the history of the berlinale yet – a development which , according to thomas hailer , director of the children 's festival , proves how " films all over the world are showing more and more respect to children . " important for the film industry but the main attraction to the berlinale is due to be the entourage of stars in the german capital for the event .
although berlin may lack the glamour and style of film festival hosts venice and cannes , the sheer volume of visitors makes it one of the most important venues for the film business in the world . this year , numerous names from the film industry have announced their arrival in berlin for the festival , including directors spike lee , oliver stone , michael winterbottom and oskar roehler , and world famous actors kevin spacey , macaulay culkin , catherine zeta-jones and george cloony . and the public will have the chance to get closer to the stars at the festival 's new berlinale talent campus , " a unique platform for aspiring young filmmakers from all over the world . "
here , 500 young directors , producers and actors will sit down to topics concerning the making of a film with their more famous and experienced counterparts .
the results will then subsequently be presented to the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the berlinale film festival 2003 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .
at the same time , u.s. secretary of state colin powell also requested to be interviewed by one of these stations , and a key adviser to the pentagon , richard perle , spoke out in a newspaper interview about the meaningless of schröder 's opposition .
chancellor 's stakes out position schröder 's opposition to a possible war on iraq took shape during the summer while he was campaigning for re-election .
taking a position that contrasted with his support of the 1999 war against yugoslavia , schröder pledged that german troops would not join any u.s.-led military campaign against saddam hussein .
last week , the chancellor went even further in his opposition , telling a campaign rally in his home state of lower saxony that germany would not support any security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
in his television interview with the ard network , schröder elaborated on the reasons for his opposition .
" the germans have had their own experiences with war , " he said .
" and that has left a deep mark on their collective conscience .
therefore , people have to understand that we - when faced with the question of war as a normal part of political options - have a position based on principle . "
the chancellor also expressed his disappointment with bush 's failure to present evidence earlier in the debate .
" i would have liked for intelligence information - from whatever source - to have been put on the table at the start of the process , " he said .
in the address , bush said he would send secretary of state colin powell to the united nations next wednesday to share intelligence on iraq .
administration officials said the data showed saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
powell seeks to sway germans powell , in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday , said he hoped the germans would change their minds after seeing the new information .
" we hope that in the next few days , when we discuss this together , the german public and its political leaders will look at everything in a different light , " powell said .
but key adviser to the pentagon richard perle suggested in an interview with a munich newspaper that schröder and the country he represents no longer mattered .
schröder has assumed " such an extreme position that he has taken germany and himself out of the debate , " perle told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" germany is irrelevant .
and it is not particularly easy for a german chancellor to make his country irrelevant . "
state of the union speech sparks criticism unlike schröder and fischer , who welcomed bush 's state of the union address , other members of the parties that form germany 's governing coalition proved more skeptical and voiced their criticism on wednesday .
gernot erler , the vice chairman of the social democratic group in the german parliament , said in a television interview , " it is clear that the american president actually does not want to end a program of weapons of mass destruction in iraq , but is dead set on waging war and is looking for justification for his action . "
erler and angelika beer , the co-leader of the junior coalition partner , the green party , also questioned bush 's motives for pledging to turn over more information to the security council .
" the question naturally arises : why was n't bush 's proof presented to the u.n. long ago ? "
beer said in an early morning radio interview .
erler said he doubted that bush actually wanted to work with the united nations .
" why is he withholding this supposed secret information and then planning to pull a rabbit out of his hat next week ? " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

back at home , satisfying his guests is more important than recognition . the talblick restaurant is a modest establishment , just a stone ’ s throw away from the local town church in wildberg , a spa town in the black forest with a population of 10,000 . but last year , its young chef won a prestigious international cooking award , making a new star out of the rustic country inn on germany 's culinary landscape . on thursday , weitbrecht added another feather into his hat , placing third at the international cooking competition bocuse d 'or . sturgeon specials claus weitbrecht completed cooking school in heidelberg in 1999 and expanded his culinary talents working for three star cooks in germany and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus weitbrecht bocuse d 'or the 29-year-old -lrb- photo -rrb- had already won numerous competitions when he was named the winner of the german bocuse d 'or competition in october last year after serving the jury his concoction “ miscellaneous from sturgeon with imperial caviar . ” in november 2002 he took over his parents ’ business , the restaurant talblick in wildberg .
as bocuse d ’ or german master he will cook for germany at the international competition in lyon , france that runs from january 27 - 30 . the golden bocuse the bocuse d ’ or takes its name from the eminent french chef paul bocuse , who established the competition in 1987 . what makes the bocuse d ’ or different from other culinary prizes is that competing chefs cook in front of an audience , so the public can see how much work it takes to make a fine meal .
the competition takes place each year during the culinary sector exhibition in lyon , bocuse ’ s hometown and one of the world ’ s capitals of fine cooking .
looking for the original so far german chefs won bronze medals in 1995 and 1997 .
if weitbrecht wins at the international competition in lyon , he will be the first german winner of the illustrious prize .
but it won ’ t be easy to outshine his competitors who represent 23 other countries . " you have to make something , that has never been made , ” weitbrecht explains .
“ and that ’ s very difficult in the kitchen because there are thousands of very good cooks , and they have all written very good cookbooks .
and then to find something that no one in the top-class jury has ever seen … .
the air gets thin at the top , it ’ s like in competitive sports . "
the specifications are the same for everyone : filet of beef bouchère , norwegian fjord trout and oxtail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.01.2003 schröder remains opposed to war on iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against a war in iraq continued in germany this week chancellor gerhard schröder says he is unlikely to change his views on a war in iraq - no matter what information the u.s. has on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .
at the same time , u.s. secretary of state colin powell also requested to be interviewed by one of these stations , and a key adviser to the pentagon , richard perle , spoke out in a newspaper interview about the meaningless of schröder 's opposition .
chancellor 's stakes out position schröder 's opposition to a possible war on iraq took shape during the summer while he was campaigning for re-election .
taking a position that contrasted with his support of the 1999 war against yugoslavia , schröder pledged that german troops would not join any u.s.-led military campaign against saddam hussein .
last week , the chancellor went even further in his opposition , telling a campaign rally in his home state of lower saxony that germany would not support any security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
in his television interview with the ard network , schröder elaborated on the reasons for his opposition .
" the germans have had their own experiences with war , " he said .
" and that has left a deep mark on their collective conscience .
therefore , people have to understand that we - when faced with the question of war as a normal part of political options - have a position based on principle . "
the chancellor also expressed his disappointment with bush 's failure to present evidence earlier in the debate .
" i would have liked for intelligence information - from whatever source - to have been put on the table at the start of the process , " he said .
in the address , bush said he would send secretary of state colin powell to the united nations next wednesday to share intelligence on iraq .
administration officials said the data showed saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
powell seeks to sway germans powell , in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday , said he hoped the germans would change their minds after seeing the new information .
" we hope that in the next few days , when we discuss this together , the german public and its political leaders will look at everything in a different light , " powell said .
but key adviser to the pentagon richard perle suggested in an interview with a munich newspaper that schröder and the country he represents no longer mattered .
schröder has assumed " such an extreme position that he has taken germany and himself out of the debate , " perle told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" germany is irrelevant .
and it is not particularly easy for a german chancellor to make his country irrelevant . "
state of the union speech sparks criticism unlike schröder and fischer , who welcomed bush 's state of the union address , other members of the parties that form germany 's governing coalition proved more skeptical and voiced their criticism on wednesday .
gernot erler , the vice chairman of the social democratic group in the german parliament , said in a television interview , " it is clear that the american president actually does not want to end a program of weapons of mass destruction in iraq , but is dead set on waging war and is looking for justification for his action . "
erler and angelika beer , the co-leader of the junior coalition partner , the green party , also questioned bush 's motives for pledging to turn over more information to the security council .
" the question naturally arises : why was n't bush 's proof presented to the u.n. long ago ? "
beer said in an early morning radio interview .
erler said he doubted that bush actually wanted to work with the united nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.01.2003 german chef reaches for stars in france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of weitbrecht 's culinary wonders claus weitbrecht cooked his way to a bronze medal at the bocuse d 'or culinary cook-off in lyon , france , on thursday .
back at home , satisfying his guests is more important than recognition . the talblick restaurant is a modest establishment , just a stone ’ s throw away from the local town church in wildberg , a spa town in the black forest with a population of 10,000 . but last year , its young chef won a prestigious international cooking award , making a new star out of the rustic country inn on germany 's culinary landscape . on thursday , weitbrecht added another feather into his hat , placing third at the international cooking competition bocuse d 'or . sturgeon specials claus weitbrecht completed cooking school in heidelberg in 1999 and expanded his culinary talents working for three star cooks in germany and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus weitbrecht bocuse d 'or the 29-year-old -lrb- photo -rrb- had already won numerous competitions when he was named the winner of the german bocuse d 'or competition in october last year after serving the jury his concoction “ miscellaneous from sturgeon with imperial caviar . ” in november 2002 he took over his parents ’ business , the restaurant talblick in wildberg .
as bocuse d ’ or german master he will cook for germany at the international competition in lyon , france that runs from january 27 - 30 . the golden bocuse the bocuse d ’ or takes its name from the eminent french chef paul bocuse , who established the competition in 1987 . what makes the bocuse d ’ or different from other culinary prizes is that competing chefs cook in front of an audience , so the public can see how much work it takes to make a fine meal .
the competition takes place each year during the culinary sector exhibition in lyon , bocuse ’ s hometown and one of the world ’ s capitals of fine cooking .
looking for the original so far german chefs won bronze medals in 1995 and 1997 .
if weitbrecht wins at the international competition in lyon , he will be the first german winner of the illustrious prize .
but it won ’ t be easy to outshine his competitors who represent 23 other countries . " you have to make something , that has never been made , ” weitbrecht explains .
“ and that ’ s very difficult in the kitchen because there are thousands of very good cooks , and they have all written very good cookbooks .
and then to find something that no one in the top-class jury has ever seen … .
the air gets thin at the top , it ’ s like in competitive sports . "
the specifications are the same for everyone : filet of beef bouchère , norwegian fjord trout and oxtail .
the chefs determine the side dishes themselves .
they have five hours to cook recipes that must be original , professional and tasty .
few people are aware of the costs and the effort that go into it . stiff competition " the scandinavian countries have sponsors and sponsors ’ funds at their disposal that germany can only dream of … .
the norwegians especially , they have € 500,000 – 600,000 with which they can do what they want , ” weitbrecht comments .
“ six months before the event takes place in lyon , the -lsb- norwegian -rsb- candidate starts training , so he will have cooked his dish at least 10 or 15 times racing the clock , under pressure . "
weitbrecht trains with his assistant , ludwig heer .
but he does it at the same time as living up to his daily responsibilities .
one guest orders viennese sausages with lentils , another orders schnitzel .
in the meantime , the postman comes , delivering a package from france : a kilo -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of fresh truffles .
they are for filling the trout at the competition . racing the clock over and over the chef and his assistant talk through the recipes , practicing until late in the night .
cutting and chopping , pureeing and garnishing , everything is measured with the stopwatch , since in lyon every minute counts .
ludwig heer is still dissatisfied : preparing the pastry takes too long .
" we 'll have to do it another five times , " he says , and then maybe we ’ ll make it . "
heer aims to cut the time down from the current 15:25 to 12:25 : " then it will work . "
at his restaurant in wildberg , claus weitbrecht makes three and five course meals , but only on those occasions when guests specifically order them .
otherwise , he cooks according to talblick ’ s menu .
he hopes that that will soon change , and that more customers will be enticed to take a seat at his restaurant just to sample his wares .
" my dream is that we will win something down there -lsb- in lyon -rsb- , and another dream is to have a michelin star sometime , ” he admits .
“ but the most important aspect is that the guests that come here leave the place satisfied .
it ’ s not worth cooking for a star at any price . ” günther birkenstock send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links bocuse d 'or 2003 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .
at the same time , u.s. secretary of state colin powell also requested to be interviewed by one of these stations , and a key adviser to the pentagon , richard perle , spoke out in a newspaper interview about the meaningless of schröder 's opposition .
chancellor 's stakes out position schröder 's opposition to a possible war on iraq took shape during the summer while he was campaigning for re-election .
taking a position that contrasted with his support of the 1999 war against yugoslavia , schröder pledged that german troops would not join any u.s.-led military campaign against saddam hussein .
last week , the chancellor went even further in his opposition , telling a campaign rally in his home state of lower saxony that germany would not support any security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
in his television interview with the ard network , schröder elaborated on the reasons for his opposition .
" the germans have had their own experiences with war , " he said .
" and that has left a deep mark on their collective conscience .
therefore , people have to understand that we - when faced with the question of war as a normal part of political options - have a position based on principle . "
the chancellor also expressed his disappointment with bush 's failure to present evidence earlier in the debate .
" i would have liked for intelligence information - from whatever source - to have been put on the table at the start of the process , " he said .
in the address , bush said he would send secretary of state colin powell to the united nations next wednesday to share intelligence on iraq .
administration officials said the data showed saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
powell seeks to sway germans powell , in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday , said he hoped the germans would change their minds after seeing the new information .
" we hope that in the next few days , when we discuss this together , the german public and its political leaders will look at everything in a different light , " powell said .
but key adviser to the pentagon richard perle suggested in an interview with a munich newspaper that schröder and the country he represents no longer mattered .
schröder has assumed " such an extreme position that he has taken germany and himself out of the debate , " perle told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" germany is irrelevant .
and it is not particularly easy for a german chancellor to make his country irrelevant . "
state of the union speech sparks criticism unlike schröder and fischer , who welcomed bush 's state of the union address , other members of the parties that form germany 's governing coalition proved more skeptical and voiced their criticism on wednesday .
gernot erler , the vice chairman of the social democratic group in the german parliament , said in a television interview , " it is clear that the american president actually does not want to end a program of weapons of mass destruction in iraq , but is dead set on waging war and is looking for justification for his action . "
erler and angelika beer , the co-leader of the junior coalition partner , the green party , also questioned bush 's motives for pledging to turn over more information to the security council .
" the question naturally arises : why was n't bush 's proof presented to the u.n. long ago ? "
beer said in an early morning radio interview .
erler said he doubted that bush actually wanted to work with the united nations .
" why is he withholding this supposed secret information and then planning to pull a rabbit out of his hat next week ? " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

back at home , satisfying his guests is more important than recognition . the talblick restaurant is a modest establishment , just a stone ’ s throw away from the local town church in wildberg , a spa town in the black forest with a population of 10,000 . but last year , its young chef won a prestigious international cooking award , making a new star out of the rustic country inn on germany 's culinary landscape . on thursday , weitbrecht added another feather into his hat , placing third at the international cooking competition bocuse d 'or . sturgeon specials claus weitbrecht completed cooking school in heidelberg in 1999 and expanded his culinary talents working for three star cooks in germany and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus weitbrecht bocuse d 'or the 29-year-old -lrb- photo -rrb- had already won numerous competitions when he was named the winner of the german bocuse d 'or competition in october last year after serving the jury his concoction “ miscellaneous from sturgeon with imperial caviar . ” in november 2002 he took over his parents ’ business , the restaurant talblick in wildberg .
as bocuse d ’ or german master he will cook for germany at the international competition in lyon , france that runs from january 27 - 30 . the golden bocuse the bocuse d ’ or takes its name from the eminent french chef paul bocuse , who established the competition in 1987 . what makes the bocuse d ’ or different from other culinary prizes is that competing chefs cook in front of an audience , so the public can see how much work it takes to make a fine meal .
the competition takes place each year during the culinary sector exhibition in lyon , bocuse ’ s hometown and one of the world ’ s capitals of fine cooking .
looking for the original so far german chefs won bronze medals in 1995 and 1997 .
if weitbrecht wins at the international competition in lyon , he will be the first german winner of the illustrious prize .
but it won ’ t be easy to outshine his competitors who represent 23 other countries . " you have to make something , that has never been made , ” weitbrecht explains .
“ and that ’ s very difficult in the kitchen because there are thousands of very good cooks , and they have all written very good cookbooks .
and then to find something that no one in the top-class jury has ever seen … .
the air gets thin at the top , it ’ s like in competitive sports . "
the specifications are the same for everyone : filet of beef bouchère , norwegian fjord trout and oxtail .
the chefs determine the side dishes themselves .
they have five hours to cook recipes that must be original , professional and tasty .
few people are aware of the costs and the effort that go into it . stiff competition " the scandinavian countries have sponsors and sponsors ’ funds at their disposal that germany can only dream of … .
the norwegians especially , they have € 500,000 – 600,000 with which they can do what they want , ” weitbrecht comments .
“ six months before the event takes place in lyon , the -lsb- norwegian -rsb- candidate starts training , so he will have cooked his dish at least 10 or 15 times racing the clock , under pressure . "
weitbrecht trains with his assistant , ludwig heer .
but he does it at the same time as living up to his daily responsibilities .
one guest orders viennese sausages with lentils , another orders schnitzel .
in the meantime , the postman comes , delivering a package from france : a kilo -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of fresh truffles .
they are for filling the trout at the competition . racing the clock over and over the chef and his assistant talk through the recipes , practicing until late in the night .
cutting and chopping , pureeing and garnishing , everything is measured with the stopwatch , since in lyon every minute counts .
ludwig heer is still dissatisfied : preparing the pastry takes too long .
" we 'll have to do it another five times , " he says , and then maybe we ’ ll make it . "
heer aims to cut the time down from the current 15:25 to 12:25 : " then it will work . "
at his restaurant in wildberg , claus weitbrecht makes three and five course meals , but only on those occasions when guests specifically order them .
otherwise , he cooks according to talblick ’ s menu .
he hopes that that will soon change , and that more customers will be enticed to take a seat at his restaurant just to sample his wares .
" my dream is that we will win something down there -lsb- in lyon -rsb- , and another dream is to have a michelin star sometime , ” he admits .
“ but the most important aspect is that the guests that come here leave the place satisfied .
it ’ s not worth cooking for a star at any price . ” günther birkenstock send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links bocuse d 'or 2003 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in addition , three german films will be running for the golden bear , the berlinale film award , along with a further 19 movies . further highlights include a series of films starring legendary french actress anouk aimée , 26 world premiers , a selection of " artistically orientated contemporary film " – 52 films from 24 countries - , and a " lively overview of the results of world cinema in the past 12 months " featured in the berlinale panorama section : 17 films , 12 documentaries and 23 short films from 31 countries . in addition , this year 's berlinale will have a strong focus on short film , with a new separate short film festival hosting 57 films with which the berlinale hopes to direct the audience 's attention to " a medium , in which newcomers can prove and distinguish themselves . "
and an international children 's film festival will feature parallel to the berlinale , the largest in the history of the berlinale yet – a development which , according to thomas hailer , director of the children 's festival , proves how " films all over the world are showing more and more respect to children . " important for the film industry but the main attraction to the berlinale is due to be the entourage of stars in the german capital for the event .
although berlin may lack the glamour and style of film festival hosts venice and cannes , the sheer volume of visitors makes it one of the most important venues for the film business in the world . this year , numerous names from the film industry have announced their arrival in berlin for the festival , including directors spike lee , oliver stone , michael winterbottom and oskar roehler , and world famous actors kevin spacey , macaulay culkin , catherine zeta-jones and george cloony . and the public will have the chance to get closer to the stars at the festival 's new berlinale talent campus , " a unique platform for aspiring young filmmakers from all over the world . "
here , 500 young directors , producers and actors will sit down to topics concerning the making of a film with their more famous and experienced counterparts .

this year 's motto " towards tolerance " did not just refer to the mixture of " intelligent entertainment film and challenging cinema " , kosslick said , but also showed that a competition with international artists could be a peaceful affair . so far , however , this year 's berlinale is set to run as planned , and hopes to attract more than 100,000 visitors to berlin 's cinemas for ten days of the best and the newest in world cinema .

war is not the way to conduct politics , he says . germany is unlikely to be swayed from its opposition to any u.s.-led war on iraq by the new information that president george w. bush plans to present to the u.n. security council next week , chancellor gerhard schröder said .
" i think people are deluding themselves about our position , " schröder said in a television interview on german public television wednesday night .
" it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position . "
schröder made the comments as part of a blitz of media interviews given by leading u.s. and german politicians after president george w. bush made his state of the union address on tuesday , pledging that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
on wednesday , the chancellor gave separate interviews to both of the country 's national public television stations to explain his position .
at the same time , u.s. secretary of state colin powell also requested to be interviewed by one of these stations , and a key adviser to the pentagon , richard perle , spoke out in a newspaper interview about the meaningless of schröder 's opposition .
chancellor 's stakes out position schröder 's opposition to a possible war on iraq took shape during the summer while he was campaigning for re-election .
taking a position that contrasted with his support of the 1999 war against yugoslavia , schröder pledged that german troops would not join any u.s.-led military campaign against saddam hussein .
last week , the chancellor went even further in his opposition , telling a campaign rally in his home state of lower saxony that germany would not support any security council resolution authorizing a war on iraq .
in his television interview with the ard network , schröder elaborated on the reasons for his opposition .
" the germans have had their own experiences with war , " he said .
" and that has left a deep mark on their collective conscience .
therefore , people have to understand that we - when faced with the question of war as a normal part of political options - have a position based on principle . "
the chancellor also expressed his disappointment with bush 's failure to present evidence earlier in the debate .
" i would have liked for intelligence information - from whatever source - to have been put on the table at the start of the process , " he said .
in the address , bush said he would send secretary of state colin powell to the united nations next wednesday to share intelligence on iraq .
administration officials said the data showed saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
powell seeks to sway germans powell , in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf on wednesday , said he hoped the germans would change their minds after seeing the new information .
" we hope that in the next few days , when we discuss this together , the german public and its political leaders will look at everything in a different light , " powell said .
but key adviser to the pentagon richard perle suggested in an interview with a munich newspaper that schröder and the country he represents no longer mattered .
schröder has assumed " such an extreme position that he has taken germany and himself out of the debate , " perle told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" germany is irrelevant .
and it is not particularly easy for a german chancellor to make his country irrelevant . "
state of the union speech sparks criticism unlike schröder and fischer , who welcomed bush 's state of the union address , other members of the parties that form germany 's governing coalition proved more skeptical and voiced their criticism on wednesday .
gernot erler , the vice chairman of the social democratic group in the german parliament , said in a television interview , " it is clear that the american president actually does not want to end a program of weapons of mass destruction in iraq , but is dead set on waging war and is looking for justification for his action . "
erler and angelika beer , the co-leader of the junior coalition partner , the green party , also questioned bush 's motives for pledging to turn over more information to the security council .
" the question naturally arises : why was n't bush 's proof presented to the u.n. long ago ? "
beer said in an early morning radio interview .
erler said he doubted that bush actually wanted to work with the united nations .
" why is he withholding this supposed secret information and then planning to pull a rabbit out of his hat next week ? " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

back at home , satisfying his guests is more important than recognition . the talblick restaurant is a modest establishment , just a stone ’ s throw away from the local town church in wildberg , a spa town in the black forest with a population of 10,000 . but last year , its young chef won a prestigious international cooking award , making a new star out of the rustic country inn on germany 's culinary landscape . on thursday , weitbrecht added another feather into his hat , placing third at the international cooking competition bocuse d 'or . sturgeon specials claus weitbrecht completed cooking school in heidelberg in 1999 and expanded his culinary talents working for three star cooks in germany and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus weitbrecht bocuse d 'or the 29-year-old -lrb- photo -rrb- had already won numerous competitions when he was named the winner of the german bocuse d 'or competition in october last year after serving the jury his concoction “ miscellaneous from sturgeon with imperial caviar . ” in november 2002 he took over his parents ’ business , the restaurant talblick in wildberg .
as bocuse d ’ or german master he will cook for germany at the international competition in lyon , france that runs from january 27 - 30 . the golden bocuse the bocuse d ’ or takes its name from the eminent french chef paul bocuse , who established the competition in 1987 . what makes the bocuse d ’ or different from other culinary prizes is that competing chefs cook in front of an audience , so the public can see how much work it takes to make a fine meal .
the competition takes place each year during the culinary sector exhibition in lyon , bocuse ’ s hometown and one of the world ’ s capitals of fine cooking .
looking for the original so far german chefs won bronze medals in 1995 and 1997 .
if weitbrecht wins at the international competition in lyon , he will be the first german winner of the illustrious prize .
but it won ’ t be easy to outshine his competitors who represent 23 other countries . " you have to make something , that has never been made , ” weitbrecht explains .
“ and that ’ s very difficult in the kitchen because there are thousands of very good cooks , and they have all written very good cookbooks .
and then to find something that no one in the top-class jury has ever seen … .
the air gets thin at the top , it ’ s like in competitive sports . "
the specifications are the same for everyone : filet of beef bouchère , norwegian fjord trout and oxtail .
the chefs determine the side dishes themselves .
they have five hours to cook recipes that must be original , professional and tasty .
few people are aware of the costs and the effort that go into it . stiff competition " the scandinavian countries have sponsors and sponsors ’ funds at their disposal that germany can only dream of … .
the norwegians especially , they have € 500,000 – 600,000 with which they can do what they want , ” weitbrecht comments .
“ six months before the event takes place in lyon , the -lsb- norwegian -rsb- candidate starts training , so he will have cooked his dish at least 10 or 15 times racing the clock , under pressure . "
weitbrecht trains with his assistant , ludwig heer .
but he does it at the same time as living up to his daily responsibilities .
one guest orders viennese sausages with lentils , another orders schnitzel .
in the meantime , the postman comes , delivering a package from france : a kilo -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of fresh truffles .
they are for filling the trout at the competition . racing the clock over and over the chef and his assistant talk through the recipes , practicing until late in the night .
cutting and chopping , pureeing and garnishing , everything is measured with the stopwatch , since in lyon every minute counts .
ludwig heer is still dissatisfied : preparing the pastry takes too long .
" we 'll have to do it another five times , " he says , and then maybe we ’ ll make it . "
heer aims to cut the time down from the current 15:25 to 12:25 : " then it will work . "
at his restaurant in wildberg , claus weitbrecht makes three and five course meals , but only on those occasions when guests specifically order them .
otherwise , he cooks according to talblick ’ s menu .
he hopes that that will soon change , and that more customers will be enticed to take a seat at his restaurant just to sample his wares .
" my dream is that we will win something down there -lsb- in lyon -rsb- , and another dream is to have a michelin star sometime , ” he admits .
“ but the most important aspect is that the guests that come here leave the place satisfied .
it ’ s not worth cooking for a star at any price . ” günther birkenstock send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links bocuse d 'or 2003 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

back at home , satisfying his guests is more important than recognition . the talblick restaurant is a modest establishment , just a stone ’ s throw away from the local town church in wildberg , a spa town in the black forest with a population of 10,000 . but last year , its young chef won a prestigious international cooking award , making a new star out of the rustic country inn on germany 's culinary landscape . on thursday , weitbrecht added another feather into his hat , placing third at the international cooking competition bocuse d 'or . sturgeon specials claus weitbrecht completed cooking school in heidelberg in 1999 and expanded his culinary talents working for three star cooks in germany and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claus weitbrecht bocuse d 'or the 29-year-old -lrb- photo -rrb- had already won numerous competitions when he was named the winner of the german bocuse d 'or competition in october last year after serving the jury his concoction “ miscellaneous from sturgeon with imperial caviar . ” in november 2002 he took over his parents ’ business , the restaurant talblick in wildberg .
as bocuse d ’ or german master he will cook for germany at the international competition in lyon , france that runs from january 27 - 30 . the golden bocuse the bocuse d ’ or takes its name from the eminent french chef paul bocuse , who established the competition in 1987 . what makes the bocuse d ’ or different from other culinary prizes is that competing chefs cook in front of an audience , so the public can see how much work it takes to make a fine meal .
the competition takes place each year during the culinary sector exhibition in lyon , bocuse ’ s hometown and one of the world ’ s capitals of fine cooking .
looking for the original so far german chefs won bronze medals in 1995 and 1997 .
if weitbrecht wins at the international competition in lyon , he will be the first german winner of the illustrious prize .
but it won ’ t be easy to outshine his competitors who represent 23 other countries . " you have to make something , that has never been made , ” weitbrecht explains .
“ and that ’ s very difficult in the kitchen because there are thousands of very good cooks , and they have all written very good cookbooks .
and then to find something that no one in the top-class jury has ever seen … .
the air gets thin at the top , it ’ s like in competitive sports . "
the specifications are the same for everyone : filet of beef bouchère , norwegian fjord trout and oxtail .
the chefs determine the side dishes themselves .
they have five hours to cook recipes that must be original , professional and tasty .
few people are aware of the costs and the effort that go into it . stiff competition " the scandinavian countries have sponsors and sponsors ’ funds at their disposal that germany can only dream of … .
the norwegians especially , they have € 500,000 – 600,000 with which they can do what they want , ” weitbrecht comments .
“ six months before the event takes place in lyon , the -lsb- norwegian -rsb- candidate starts training , so he will have cooked his dish at least 10 or 15 times racing the clock , under pressure . "
weitbrecht trains with his assistant , ludwig heer .
but he does it at the same time as living up to his daily responsibilities .
one guest orders viennese sausages with lentils , another orders schnitzel .
in the meantime , the postman comes , delivering a package from france : a kilo -lrb- 2.2 pounds -rrb- of fresh truffles .
they are for filling the trout at the competition . racing the clock over and over the chef and his assistant talk through the recipes , practicing until late in the night .
cutting and chopping , pureeing and garnishing , everything is measured with the stopwatch , since in lyon every minute counts .
ludwig heer is still dissatisfied : preparing the pastry takes too long .
" we 'll have to do it another five times , " he says , and then maybe we ’ ll make it . "
heer aims to cut the time down from the current 15:25 to 12:25 : " then it will work . "
at his restaurant in wildberg , claus weitbrecht makes three and five course meals , but only on those occasions when guests specifically order them .
otherwise , he cooks according to talblick ’ s menu .
he hopes that that will soon change , and that more customers will be enticed to take a seat at his restaurant just to sample his wares .
" my dream is that we will win something down there -lsb- in lyon -rsb- , and another dream is to have a michelin star sometime , ” he admits .
“ but the most important aspect is that the guests that come here leave the place satisfied .

phoenix 's deal with the state broadcaster in guangdong , the affluent southern province abutting hong kong , means the two will share the channel 's advertising revenues , a phoenix spokesman said .
but , he added , it would also mean the chinese state gets an extra incentive to crack down on the piracy which dogs chinese broadcasting .
private firms routinely strip the adverts off the satellite signal and then rebroadcast it with their own adverts , a process known as " ad splicing " .
problems phoenix has legal access to 42 million households through state-run cable networks , but has no estimate of how many more may be watching through hacked broadcasts , the spokesman said .
the ad splicing problem is particularly acute for hong kong-based broadcasters , analysts say , costing them billions of hong kong dollars a year .
the company is 38 % owned by news corp , mr murdoch 's main corporate vehicle .
another 38 % belongs to a former propagandist for the people 's liberation army .
it broadcasts three channels to mainland china , including a news channel only given permission to operate late last year .
access the deal is by no means the first for news corp with a regional state broadcaster .
it became the first foreign broadcaster to be allowed to beam its programmes onto the mainland last year with a deal with hunan 's provincial broadcaster , although the deal was about content swaps rather than advertising money .
and his star group is already broadcasting direct to guangdong .
the star channels have been established in china for some years , following news corp 's decision to drop bbc news channels after chinese government complaints solidified mr murdoch 's position as a man the government could do business with .

an expansion of 3 % between october and december meant that growth for the whole of 2002 was 4.6 % , the government said .
" this growth must now be translated to social equity " president gloria arroyo the " astounding headline figure " , as one economist put it , followed a fall in gdp of 0.1 % in the previous three months , was the result of a surge in agricultural output .
but economists warned that as well as the risk of dry weather cutting into growth , the economy is still plagued by rampant corruption , budget deficit problems caused by weak tax collection , and uncertain investor confidence .
the president , gloria arroyo , has ruled out running in the 2004 election to allow her to concentrate on the economy , but few see much chance of big change either on corruption or on more general anti-poverty targets .
and , they point out , the risk of insurgency from muslim rebels could grow still further if the us launches a war on iraq .
above target the 4.6 % growth rate for the year was certainly ahead of expectations .
analysts were predicting 4 % , following the 3.2 % rise in 2001 , while the government 's own forecast was 4-4.5 % .
the government was quick to point out its success , but stressed challenges ahead .
" this growth must now be translated to social equity , " said president gloria arroyo .
lukewarm not everyone is convinced the figures are reliable , however .
some analysts noted that under-reporting of imports had led the government to downgrade growth figures for 2000 and 2001 .
and the markets were slow to show any positive response , with the main index finishing up less than a point at 1,039.88 as war worries dominated sentiment .

local people fear that cardiac services may be moved elsewhere and have already begun a campaign to save the facility at a brecon hospital .
maternity services have already been cut doctors and members of a local action group say plans to move cardiac services further afield will put lives at risk and threaten the future of the hospital .
maternity services were downgraded at the brecon war memorial hospital more than a year ago in the face of widespread local protest .
many mothers now have to travel 30 miles to abergavenny to give birth .
the action group set up to fight the loss of the cardiac services says that it is vital for a rural area like south powys to retain its own facility .
read this in welsh it claims a delay in treatment could be critical and could lead to lives being lost .
this is a vitally important issue cllr tony bufton the group has condemned proposals to transfer cardiac in-patient services from the hospital to nevill hall hospital , abergavenny , or to the new hospital at hereford from next april .
nevill hall will open a new six-bed cardiac unit next march .
it serves gwent and south powys .
mayor of brecon , councillor tony bufton , said : " this is a vitally important issue not only for the town but for a large part of breconshire .
" if it is not resisted , it will mean the loss of an excellent service and the trained medical and nursing staff who provide it .
" we must not become a second-class community because we live in a rural area . "
the action group is also worried that a further erosion of services could threaten the hospital 's viability .
the powys health trust said it has a duty to meet stringent professional safety regulations .

the millennium stone was at the centre of a lottery-funded project to recreate the efforts of stonehenge 's founders two years ago .
a crane was used to move the stone the original scheme was scuppered when the stone sank off the welsh coast just 17 miles into the 240-mile journey from the preseli mountains in pembrokeshire to salisbury plain in wiltshire .
the eight-foot tall stone lay on the quayside in milford haven since being retrieved by navy divers until it was moved to the national botanic gardens of wales in carmarthenshire on thursday .
it now forms part of an exhibition at the gardens .
" the stone has been placed on its side on a plinth to show it was the one that made the journey , " said owen jenkins , from the garden .
" we have obtained another stone which has been placed in an upright position to show how it would have looked had it reached its destination , " he added .
a currach - one of the boats used during the attempt - is also on display .
" the stone fits in with our rocks of ages exhibition which illustrates the geological history of wales from the oldest to the youngest , " said mr jenkins .
insurance glitch " we are all delighted and very excited about the stone arriving , " said mr jenkins .
" it is a good kick-start to what promises to be a very exciting year in the development of the gardens , " he added .
the stone ties in with the rocks of ages exhibition staff will be unveiling a double-walled garden in june , in which the temperature is regulated by the inner and outer walls , enabling an innovative range of plants to be grown .
the millennium stone 's epic adventure had to be abandoned when insurance cover could not be found for a repeat seaward journey .
a number of requests were made by different organisations to house the stone including one from mynachlogddu community council to return it to its starting place in the preseli mountains .
stonehenge 's creators are thought to have transported bluestones from preseli 240-miles by land and sea in order to build the monument 's inner circle .

the premier had claimed milan 's judges were biased against him and would not give him a fair hearing .
i shall perform my duty as prime minister until the end silvio berlusconi , italian prime minister mr berlusconi 's request was made within the provisions of a recently-passed law allowing defendants to demand that their case be heard at a different court , should they suspect the judges are biased .
his critics believe the controversial law was tailor-made for mr berlusconi and his associates .
political pressure in a live tv address , broadcast during the main lunch-time news bulletins , mr berlusconi repeatedly accused the italian judiciary of being politically-motivated .
" in a liberal democracy judges implement the law , they do not get involved in politics and especially , they do not ' resist , resist , resist ' those who have been chosen to govern , " the premier declared .
he was referring to former milan prosecutor-general francesco saverio borrelli who a year ago appealed to italy 's judges to resist political pressure .
in his address , mr berlusconi also said he had no intention of resigning - even if a milan court convicted him of corruption .
" i shall perform my duty as prime minister until the end , until the end , without ever betraying the mandate conferred unto me by my electors , " the tv quoted him as saying .
he added that " in a liberal democracy , those who govern on the basis of the voters ' sovereign will are judged ... only by their peers , that is , by those who were elected by the people " .
this , he said , is because " the custom and laws of immunity and guarantee protect him from the risk of political persecution through the judiciary " .

" if it is confirmed that the news bulletins have broadcast a tape made by berlusconi 's trusted technicians ... this would be very serious , " paolo gentiloni , an mp from the centrist opposition party daisy said .
and piero fassino , the leader of the democrats of the left , described the speech as " arrogant and threatening " .
according to mr fassino , mr berlusconi was displaying " outrageous behaviour ... using an unacceptable threatening tone and asking for impunity , which no citizen can demand , even less so someone who is at the helm of the country " .
mr fassino recalled that " the same supreme court had only a few months ago cancelled a berlusconi conviction in another trial " .
" so , the supreme court is good if it says berlusconi is right , it persecutes him if it says something berlusconi does n't like .
all of this is unacceptable " .

" to use tv as a megaphone to ask for immunity recalls more totalitarian regimes than the liberal democracies he was wrongly referring to , " he said .

those taxes have now been declared illegal .
the decision by the tokyo high court means the city 's governor , controversial former nationalist author turned politician shintaro ishihara , could face financial difficulties .
mr ishihara enacted the tax in february 2000 , charging banks with assets of more than 5 trillion yen -lrb- $ 42bn ; £ 26bn -rrb- 3 % of their gross profits .
the city , its revenues decimated by japan 's long downturn and the slump in property prices , was being denied tax by the banks because - he charged - their net profits were being artificially reduced or wiped out by bad debt write-offs .
debt disaster the government has estimated that the hangover from the boom years of the 1980s has left banks with loans worth 50 trillion yen which they will never be able to recoup .
interest rates of near zero percent mean that property , retail and construction companies in particular are barely servicing the massive debts they incurred , secured against assets that are now nearly worthless .
thursday also brought a downgrade by credit rating agency fitch for most japanese banks , including its four " megabanks " , saying their condition was weakening .
the 17 banks - down from 21 after recent mergers - who brought the case argue that the tax not only penalised them unfairly , but also added to the sector 's woes , impacting the whole economy .
their tax payments had dropped to 12.2bn yen in 1999-2000 from a peak of 220.8bn yen in 1989-1990 , but the new tax ballooned their payments to 102.9bn yen in the year to march 2002 .
bigger than before the court has now said it will have to return 162.8bn yen -lrb- $ 1.4bn ; £ 834m -rrb- to the banks .
the result is particularly bitter for the city , since the high court was hearing its appeal after a district court decision to award 72.4bn yen in tax rebates and 1.83bn in compensation .
a similar case in osaka , japan 's second city , has been awaiting the court 's decision , and the collection of revenues has been stayed in the meantime .

those taxes have now been declared illegal .
the decision by the tokyo high court means the city 's governor , controversial former nationalist author turned politician shintaro ishihara , could face financial difficulties .
shintaro ishihara : author of " the japan that can say no " mr ishihara enacted the tax in february 2000 , charging banks with assets of more than 5 trillion yen -lrb- $ 42bn ; £ 26bn -rrb- 3 % of their gross profits .
the city , its revenues decimated by japan 's long downturn and the slump in property prices , was being denied tax by the banks because - he charged - their net profits were being artificially reduced or wiped out by bad debt write-offs .
debt disaster the government has estimated that the hangover from the boom years of the 1980s has left banks with loans worth 50 trillion yen which they will never be able to recoup .
interest rates of near zero percent mean that property , retail and construction companies in particular are barely servicing the massive debts they incurred , secured against assets that are now nearly worthless .
thursday also brought a downgrade by credit rating agency fitch for most japanese banks , including its four " megabanks " , saying their condition was weakening .
the 17 banks - down from 21 after recent mergers - who brought the case argue that the tax not only penalised them unfairly , but also added to the sector 's woes , impacting the whole economy .
their tax payments had dropped to 12.2bn yen in 1999-2000 from a peak of 220.8bn yen in 1989-1990 , but the new tax ballooned their payments to 102.9bn yen in the year to march 2002 .
bigger than before the court has now said it will have to return 162.8bn yen -lrb- $ 1.4bn ; £ 834m -rrb- to the banks .
the result is particularly bitter for the city , since the high court was hearing its appeal after a district court decision to award 72.4bn yen in tax rebates and 1.83bn in compensation .
a similar case in osaka , japan 's second city , has been awaiting the court 's decision , and the collection of revenues has been stayed in the meantime .

bedford is an affluent place , but we have trouble retaining that affluence mo aswat town centre manager perched on benches in harpur square , a windswept plaza in the centre of bedford , the teenagers are happy to heap abuse on their home town .
" bedford 's mingin ' , " snarls lee .
" it 's boring , the shops are rubbish and there 's nothing to do . "
mingin ' or otherwise , it 's hard to find anyone who has a good word to say about britain 's benighted town centres - leading to a drift away from the high street and towards the ring-road mall .
but now the high street may be fighting back .
shutting up shop these are dark days for the market town .
shoppers ' preference for the bright lights of tesco or toys 'r'us has , it is said , come close to eradicating the traditional neighbourhood retailer .
according to a report * published in december by the new economics foundation , the number of local shops - corner shops , grocers , post offices and pubs - fell by almost one-fifth during the second half of the 1990s .
over the next five years , the report 's authors predict another cull on a similar scale .
and in case you thought this was a worry only for the small shopkeepers themselves , the foundation argues that the decline could cause unemployment , malnutrition , crime and economic catastrophe .
dirty old town at first glance bedford , an ancient town of 140,000 souls , braced between east anglia , the midlands and the home counties , is suffering no such apocalypse .
shop occupancy is high - only 5 % of retail space stands empty , half the national average .
but the town has a forlorn air , the result of the wave of charity shops and downmarket budget retailers that has swept away most independent stores .
the high street , once the town 's retail heart , is now a car-choked rat-run , lined by rowdy pubs .
" they attract a very nasty element , " sniffs one shopper .
nasty neighbours like most market towns , bedford has felt the centrifugal pull of out-of-town superstores .
this town 's major industry is apathy frank branston mayor but it also comes under intense competition from the vast amount of superior shopping opportunities within an hour 's radius - everything from north london 's megastores to the car-friendly retail parks of peterborough .
most pressing are the threats from cambridge , the region 's leading cultural centre , and milton keynes , a soulless but efficient shoppers ' paradise - both less than half an hour away .
" bedford is an affluent place , but we have trouble retaining that affluence within bedford , " says mo aswat , the indefatigable town centre manager .
" the result is that bedford looks like a poorer town than it really is . "
could do better certainly , local discontent is running high .
" when i think of what this town was like a decade ago , it looks pretty pitiful now , " fumes eleanor robson , a long-term bedford resident .
things you may not know about bedford it was the birthplace of john bunyan , 17th century author and clergyman ... ... as well as comedian ronnie barker it is the second-oldest borough in the country - its charter dates from 1166 home to 57 distinct ethnic groups , it claims to be the most diverse borough in the country it was home to many italian immigrants , drawn to the town by the brickworks in the early 20th century " they need to get rid of all these cut-price shops - they make the place look miserable . "
" this town has no food shopping in the centre , " says vic warner of goldings hardware shop , one of the few independent retailers to have stuck it out on the high street .
" a decent supermarket in town would draw people in , and that would benefit all the retailers . "
other retailers argue that parking - currently both expensive and scarce - should be improved , and that the authorities should tackle petty crime .
apathy abandoned for years , the local council - locked in legislative paralysis - did little .
mr warner is hanging on in the high street " this town 's major industry is apathy , " snorts frank branston , a former local newspaper editor who was elected mayor late last year .
" milton keynes has been growing steadily for the past 30 years and nothing was done .
now , milton keynes is out of sight in terms of competition . "
however , under the guidance of bedford 's new town centre management company , things are starting to happen .
building ambitions mo aswat is now energetically pushing a raft of projects .
lure them in , and they will shop , bedford hopes there are plans to pedestrianise the high street as a venue for markets and develop the town 's pretty , but commercially neglected , riverfront .
a large area of near-empty land near the castle is earmarked for a proposed national food museum , and the shabby bus station could be used for bedford 's first new retail development in decades .
money is being ploughed into making the town centre safer , and precious small retailers are being more earnestly courted .
something to do most importantly , the town is hugely expanding its so-far thin opportunities for recreation , including an events on the river festival and a summer beach festival .
proposed bid schemes bedford birmingham blackpool brandon bristol bromley coventry ealing greenwich hammersmith and fulham hull keswick lincoln liverpool manchester london west end newquay peterborough plymouth reading swansea warwickshire " if we can give people a reason to come into bedford over and above shopping , the rest should take care of itself , " says mr aswat .
last week , bedford learned that it was among 22 areas to pilot the government 's new business improvement districts -lrb- bids -rrb- .
a notion borrowed from the us , bids makes businesses club together to vote on and finance a five-year development plan .
unlike established schemes , the bids will include all businesses within their catchment and be funded by an obligatory levy on the rates .
mixed signals whether any of this recent activity will pay off is a matter for debate .
roy douglas , of chartered surveyors douglas duff , points out that the swankier retailers are unlikely to consider bedford - despite the fact that retail rents are one-third of milton keynes levels - until per capita spending increases .
" and that 's basic economics - there 's nothing much the council can do about that . "
but there are signs of hope .
debenhams , bhs and marks & spencer , the town 's three main retailers , recently announced £ 8m in new investments .
other new shops , including modestly smart names such as monsoon , have dipped their toe into the market .
and for the first time in a while , shopper numbers - " footfall " , in retail parlance - in the centre actually increased last year .
vitality vital is bedford typical ?
up to a point .
other market towns may lack bedford 's prosperous hinterland - but few also have to compete with so many muscular neighbours .
unlike many other ailing boroughs , moreover , bedford seems to be coming to grips with the issues underpinning retail drift .
without some fresh ideas and a dose of panache , the high street will remain the road to nowhere . * ghost town britain : the threat from economic globalisation to livelihoods , liberty and local economic freedom , new economics foundation , december 2002 .
are british towns really as grim as all that ?

at its weakest , the euro was around 84 cents .
now it 's $ 1.07 or $ 1.08 .
still well short of the level of $ 1.17 from the early days when the euro was launched in january 1999 .
with oil prices in dollars it -lsb- the decline in value -rsb- would be mildly helpful for some businesses but even so it is a striking gain , especially when you consider that it 's not as if the economy of the euro area is powering away and sucking in investment funds from around the globe looking for a decent return .
gloomy picture in fact the eurozone 's economies are growing pretty weakly .
in the third quarter of last year -lrb- the most recent for which the full set of figures are available -rrb- the us economy grew by 1 % .
for the three largest economies in the eurozone , the figures were a rather feeble 0.2 % for germany and 0.3 % for france and italy .
so why the declining dollar ?
the central reason is the large and persistent deficit in us trade with the rest of the world .
the current account deficit - which includes trade in goods and services and some other payments - was about half a trillion dollars last year , 5 % of the us economy .
tough times that deficit has to be financed , essentially by more foreign capital going into the us than there is american money leaving .
in the third quarter of 2002 germany 's economy grew by just 0.2 % during the boom of the 1990s it was no problem .
investors around the world were desperate to get a share of the gains to be made from the us stock market .
and there were many businesses eager to get involved in the us by buying american companies .
bp , vodafone , deutsche telekom and many others did it , contributing to the capital going into the united states .
now the boom has been over for two years and so is the global infatuation with investing in the us .
foreigners are no longer so interested in acquiring whole companies or shares in them .
there is still investment going into the us , but it does n't need investors to pull money out of the us en masse to put the dollar under pressure - it 's just a question of them being more reluctant to provide the new money needed to finance the continuing deficit .
if they do n't , there is still money flowing out to pay for all the imports of goods and services .
attractive options ?
the dollar has indeed declined , not very fast , it has to be said , which reflects the fact that nowhere else offers very exciting prospects for a quick profit .
investors now see emerging markets as higher risk europe is pretty sluggish , and japan remains depressed as it has been for a decade .
those developing countries that investors can easily put money into - the emerging markets - seem a lot more risky than they did .
but despite the lack of irresistible alternative places to invest , the pressure is on the dollar .
in short , several years of trade deficit is catching up with the dollar .
war threat and it has been exacerbated by the war talk .
if there is a war in iraq , the us will lead the military effort .
so investors think it is especially at risk of some sort of retaliation .
it might not be anything that would bring the us economy to a grinding halt .
but terror attacks could easily damage consumer and business confidence .
and you can see it in the currency markets .
when political and diplomatic events suggest that war is more likely , the dollar usually falls .
weak demand the decline of the us currency should normally help correct the problem - the trade deficit - behind it .
it makes foreign goods more expensive for american consumers , encouraging them to switch to home produced goods .
it also gives the rest of the world an incentive to buy more us goods .
the trouble is that with japan and western europe so weak , the booming demand for american exports just is n't there .
so despite the dollar 's decline , the underlying imbalance is still there .
uncertain future it might , just might , be a nasty problem waiting round the corner .
a gentle , orderly fall in the dollar wo n't do much harm .
and with oil prices in dollars it would be mildly helpful for some businesses .
but a rapid disorderly fall would be disruptive .
the precise effects are unpredictable , but there would probably be some severe losses in financial markets , company profits and perhaps - indirectly - in jobs too .

for the three largest economies in the eurozone , the figures were a rather feeble 0.2 % for germany and 0.3 % for france and italy .
so why the declining dollar ?
the central reason is the large and persistent deficit in us trade with the rest of the world .
the current account deficit - which includes trade in goods and services and some other payments - was about half a trillion dollars last year , 5 % of the us economy .
tough times that deficit has to be financed , essentially by more foreign capital going into the us than there is american money leaving .
during the boom of the 1990s it was no problem .
investors around the world were desperate to get a share of the gains to be made from the us stock market .
and there were many businesses eager to get involved in the us by buying american companies .
bp , vodafone , deutsche telekom and many others did it , contributing to the capital going into the united states .
now the boom has been over for two years and so is the global infatuation with investing in the us .
foreigners are no longer so interested in acquiring whole companies or shares in them .
there is still investment going into the us , but it does n't need investors to pull money out of the us en masse to put the dollar under pressure - it 's just a question of them being more reluctant to provide the new money needed to finance the continuing deficit .
if they do n't , there is still money flowing out to pay for all the imports of goods and services .
attractive options ?
the dollar has indeed declined , not very fast , it has to be said , which reflects the fact that nowhere else offers very exciting prospects for a quick profit .
europe is pretty sluggish , and japan remains depressed as it has been for a decade .
those developing countries that investors can easily put money into - the emerging markets - seem a lot more risky than they did .
but despite the lack of irresistible alternative places to invest , the pressure is on the dollar .
in short , several years of trade deficit is catching up with the dollar .
war threat and it has been exacerbated by the war talk .
if there is a war in iraq , the us will lead the military effort .
so investors think it is especially at risk of some sort of retaliation .
it might not be anything that would bring the us economy to a grinding halt .
but terror attacks could easily damage consumer and business confidence .
and you can see it in the currency markets .
when political and diplomatic events suggest that war is more likely , the dollar usually falls .
weak demand the decline of the us currency should normally help correct the problem - the trade deficit - behind it .
it makes foreign goods more expensive for american consumers , encouraging them to switch to home produced goods .
it also gives the rest of the world an incentive to buy more us goods .
the trouble is that with japan and western europe so weak , the booming demand for american exports just is n't there .
so despite the dollar 's decline , the underlying imbalance is still there .
uncertain future it might , just might , be a nasty problem waiting round the corner .
a gentle , orderly fall in the dollar wo n't do much harm .
and with oil prices in dollars it would be mildly helpful for some businesses .
but a rapid disorderly fall would be disruptive .
the precise effects are unpredictable , but there would probably be some severe losses in financial markets , company profits and perhaps - indirectly - in jobs too .

mr kinnock said apathy about european and local polls has reached " crisis point " .
i 've been such a good boy for 25 years ... i 'm going to be a bloody old nuisance neil kinnock click here for more the european commissioner told bbc news online he had long believed in compulsory voting as a way of reversing the decline in turnouts .
turnout in the 2001 general election was less than 60 % , while it was just 23 % in the european elections of 1999 .
mr kinnock said people should not forget the relatively recent battles to extend voting rights .
" my grandmother was 29 years of age before she got a vote , " he said .
" it 's that close , it 's that near , democracy is that new in our country . "
mr kinnock backs efforts to make voting easier via postal voting and the internet , but also believes that going to the polling station should be compulsory in the uk , as it is in countries like belgium .
" in belgium there is 90 % turnout , and there is no evidence to suggest political antipathy or a sense of oppression , people use their vote , " he said .
values but he said there is also a need to show that politics is about values .
making voting compulsory would help , he said , by making elections more concerned with the substance of what politicians have to say rather than with the process .
for their part , politicians must be prepared to " enunciate values in terms that relate to everyday life , not on another planet , but to be willing to speak in terms of justice , liberty ... "
politics has , however , suffered from a lack of passion among politicians , he argues - thanks in part to " the battering that passion has taken from the press " .
and labour has to take its share of the blame , he admitted .
" the kind of attacks made for instance against me - the welsh windbag - did produce in the labour movement an over-reaction which was entirely understandable .
" if it is the case that you appear to jeopardise your appeal by speaking quickly at the top of your voice and in colourful terms , you speak slowly , in a modulated tone and in less colourful terms . "
crescendo television does n't help , he says .
" passion can look synthetic in a way that it does n't when someone is listening to a 20 minute or 40 minute speech .
it would be wrong if the party had been allowed to get out of line again neil kinnock " in that there is a consistency , a theme and a rhythm and a building of arguments , crescendo of delivery - and then move on to the next argument .
" if what people see is a kind of representation of politicians that is made up entirely of ian paisley bawling into a camera you can see why people would be switched off . "
but he warns that " the longer a culture goes without good rhetoric the less rhetoric there is likely to be " .
on the continent , for instance , he says politicians have shied away from passion - partly as an understandable reaction to " demagogic rhetoric " and " cooled and quieted their politics to such an extent that their leading politicians only stand up to speak on ceremonial occasions " .
temper " it really does have a depressing effect on evocative language , " he says .
" when there is passion it usually shows itself in the form of bad temper rather than sincere , sustained , vitriol and is an explosion rather than a barrage . "
he also acknowledges that labour has developed an " instinct for control and modulation " which was " a direct product of the attacks by the press and the manifest indiscipline of the party " .
" again , maybe there is a little over-reaction which i also understand on the discipline front .
" there was a hell of a fight to get the party back in line and it would be wrong if the party had been allowed to get out of line again . "

turnout in the 2001 general election was less than 60 % , while it was just 23 % in the european elections of 1999 .
mr kinnock said people should not forget the relatively recent battles to extend voting rights .
" my grandmother was 29 years of age before she got a vote , " he said .
" it 's that close , it 's that near , democracy is that new in our country . "
mr kinnock backs efforts to make voting easier via postal voting and the internet , but also believes that going to the polling station should be compulsory in the uk , as it is in countries like belgium .
" in belgium there is 90 % turnout , and there is no evidence to suggest political antipathy or a sense of oppression , people use their vote , " he said .
values but he said there is also a need to show that politics is about values .
making voting compulsory would help , he said , by making elections more concerned with the substance of what politicians have to say rather than with the process .
for their part , politicians must be prepared to " enunciate values in terms that relate to everyday life , not on another planet , but to be willing to speak in terms of justice , liberty ... "
politics has , however , suffered from a lack of passion among politicians , he argues - thanks in part to " the battering that passion has taken from the press " .
and labour has to take its share of the blame , he admitted .
" the kind of attacks made for instance against me - the welsh windbag - did produce in the labour movement an over-reaction which was entirely understandable .
" if it is the case that you appear to jeopardise your appeal by speaking quickly at the top of your voice and in colourful terms , you speak slowly , in a modulated tone and in less colourful terms . "
crescendo television does n't help , he says .
" passion can look synthetic in a way that it does n't when someone is listening to a 20 minute or 40 minute speech . "
it would be wrong if the party had been allowed to get out of line again " neil kinnock " in that there is a consistency , a theme and a rhythm and a building of arguments , crescendo of delivery - and then move on to the next argument .
" if what people see is a kind of representation of politicians that is made up entirely of ian paisley bawling into a camera you can see why people would be switched off . "
but he warns that " the longer a culture goes without good rhetoric the less rhetoric there is likely to be " .
on the continent , for instance , he says politicians have shied away from passion - partly as an understandable reaction to " demagogic rhetoric " and " cooled and quieted their politics to such an extent that their leading politicians only stand up to speak on ceremonial occasions " .
temper " it really does have a depressing effect on evocative language , " he says .
" when there is passion it usually shows itself in the form of bad temper rather than sincere , sustained , vitriol and is an explosion rather than a barrage . "
he also acknowledges that labour has developed an " instinct for control and modulation " which was " a direct product of the attacks by the press and the manifest indiscipline of the party " .
" again , maybe there is a little over-reaction which i also understand on the discipline front .
" there was a hell of a fight to get the party back in line and it would be wrong if the party had been allowed to get out of line again . "

prices rose by 1.7 % during the month leaving the average price of a home at £ 117,905 .
the annual growth rate increased slightly to 26.5 % from 25.3 % in december , although the nationwide said this was due to smaller price rises a year ago .
but the society said it expected price growth to begin to ease later this year .
market slowing ?
recent house price surveys have suggested that the uk housing boom is finally coming to an end .
earlier this week , the latest survey from property website hometrack found that house prices rose only fractionally in january .
the small increase was put down to falls at the top end of the market , especially in london and parts of the south east of england .
and the royal institution of chartered surveyors reported earlier this month that price rises had slowed for the third month in a row in december .
steady ... for now but the nationwide said it would be a few months before annual house price inflation fell significantly .
" with the current trend in growth very stable and strong we would expect the annual inflation rate to remain around 25 % for the next couple of months , " said nationwide 's group economist alex bannister .
" however , in the six months between april and september last year house prices rose by a cumulative 15.5 % , or an annualised rate of 33 % .
" we do not expect to see this strength repeated this year and the annual rate of inflation should decline significantly over this period . "
protection nationwide noted that if house prices actually began to fall , homeowners were in a much better position to cope than in the past .
this was because house buyers are tending to put down bigger deposits when buying property .
in 1989 nearly 300,000 first-time buyers - almost half the total - put down a deposit of 5 % or less , and of these 150,000 paid no deposit at all .
last year only about 125,000 first-time buyers paid a deposit of 5 % or less .
the nationwide said there were three key risks to the housing market - a sharp rise in interest rates , a significant increase in unemployment or a large fall in consumer confidence .
while it noted that a war in iraq could hit confidence , it said sentiment should remain " robust " while unemployment continued to fall and the chance of a big rate rise was small .

the banking sector said it would resume full seven hours days , instead of the three hours per day they have been working since the strikes began .
this is the result of demands from the public and deposit holders nelson mezerhane , federal banking group president the eight-week old protests led by right-wing business groups and trade unions , which began on 2 december , were aimed at forcing mr chavez from office .
but the strike has faltered as many companies , faced with bankruptcy , reopen for business .
the " friends of venezuela " , a grouping of six nations is due in the capital caracas on thursday to help broker an end to the conflict .
led by brazil and the us , as well as diplomats from mexico , chile , spain and portugal will receive proposals for a settlement from the opposition .
dwindling enthusiasm the national banking council and the venezuelan banking association said they have decided by a two-thirds vote to restart normal operating hours from monday .
" this is the result of demands from the public and deposit holders , " said nelson mezerhane , president of the federal banking group .
" banks do n't belong to their presidents but to their deposit holders . "
support for the near-two month strikes had been starting to wane in the non-oil sectors , as businesses were forced to reopen to avoid bankruptcy .
on wednesday , port pilots returned to work allowing cargo ships to dock for the first time in puerto cabello near caracas since the strike began .
the strikes have forced venezuelans to queue for cash , food and gas , and sparked angry protests in which at least seven people have been killed .
management at shopping centres , restaurants and schools were also reportedly planning to return to work next monday .
oil strike continues ?
but oil workers at the heart of the opposition campaign vowed to continue .
more than 5,000 venezuelan oil workers have been fired since they began their strike .
and oil production has almost ceased in venezuela - the world 's fifth largest oil exporting country - helping to send crude oil prices two-year highs .
the strikes have so far cost venezuela more than $ 4bn -lrb- £ 2.4bn -rrb- and some analysts are predicting the economy will shrink by 25 % in 2003 , after contracting by 8 % in 2002 .
venezuela 's finance minister tobias nobrega said on thursday the state oil company petroleos de venezuela -lrb- pdvsa -rrb- budget would be cut by a third , or $ 2.7bn , to absorb the fall in oil export revenues .
opposition leaders are trying to change the constitution to shorten mr chavez 's term in office from seven years to four .
