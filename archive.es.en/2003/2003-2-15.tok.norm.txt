this week , berlin welcomed the 67-year-old , who has starred in more than 70 classics , but is still hoping for a role in a german film . last christmas , berlinale film festival director dieter kosslick received a book on legendary film stars .
opening it for the first time , he was rewarded with the striking image of a young , dark-haired beauty gazing at him from the glossy page – an image he was never to forget .
such was his infatuation with the enchanting young lady – french actress anouk aimeé – that he resolved one day to meet her .
this week , kosslick 's dream came true : aimée is guest of honor at the berlinale film festival .
shielding herself from the bright winter 's sunlight with a large pair of dark glasses , aimée still has her star allure despite her 67 years of age .
elegantly removing the glasses , she flashes a small smile and says she has n't slept well .
earlier this week , french director daniel toscan du plantier died – for aimée the death of a close friend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee known for her roles in films including " la dolce vita " -lrb- 1960 -rrb- and " a man and a woman " -lrb- 1966 -rrb- , aimée has always been close to the directors she worked with .
" frederico fellini and claude lelouch were my family , " she says , " just like a mother and father . "
both , together with robert altmann with whom she worked with in the film " ready to wear " in 1994 , gave her a sense of freedom she had never experienced before .
" i was n't free , but i felt it , " she says earnestly .
at the mercy of stardom born into a theatrical family , aimée began training in acting and danicing as a young girl at the bauer-theron school in paris .
at the age of 14 , she was elevated to stardom by the film " lovers of verona " -lrb- 1949 -rrb- which was especially written for her by french writer jacques prevert .
since then she has been dedicated to film , starring in movies in italy , france , britain and the u.s. and working with european film masters frederico fellini , jacques demy and claude lelouch .
it was in the film " la dolce vita " , in which aimée played the part of a nymphomaniac rich girl , starring alongside italian heartbreaker marcello mastroiani , that aimée gained her reputation as the femme fatale of classic european film .
never alone aimée gladly thinks back to the days with mastroiani .
" he was my favorite actor , " she recalls today , " simply the dream of a person , so funny and wonderful to work with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee in the film " lola " aimée is a woman who loves to laugh and for whom humor is one of the most important traits in life .
despite the death of director toscan du plantier only days ago , aimée , who is dressed from head to toe in black , still holds her head up high .
" it was a shock , and we have lost a good friend , " she says .
" but he is still here , all those we have lost are still with us . "
looking back at her life with the stars of 20th century european cinema , she says she has had a wonderful life , and does not regret a thing .
" there is not one day when i have regretted being myself .
indeed , i am lucky to be anouk aimée , and i like my life the way it is . "
more movies for the future , aimée plans making more films .
recently she starred in a german television feature , playing the part of napoleon 's mother .
this role was , however , an exception : aimée has never starred in a german film before .
" why ?
well , i would be so happy to do so , " she says with a radiant laugh .
" but no german filmmaker has ever asked me ! "

this week , berlin welcomed the 67-year-old , who has starred in more than 70 classics , but is still hoping for a role in a german film . last christmas , berlinale film festival director dieter kosslick received a book on legendary film stars .
opening it for the first time , he was rewarded with the striking image of a young , dark-haired beauty gazing at him from the glossy page – an image he was never to forget .
such was his infatuation with the enchanting young lady – french actress anouk aimeé – that he resolved one day to meet her .
this week , kosslick 's dream came true : aimée is guest of honor at the berlinale film festival .
shielding herself from the bright winter 's sunlight with a large pair of dark glasses , aimée still has her star allure despite her 67 years of age .
elegantly removing the glasses , she flashes a small smile and says she has n't slept well .
earlier this week , french director daniel toscan du plantier died – for aimée the death of a close friend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee known for her roles in films including " la dolce vita " -lrb- 1960 -rrb- and " a man and a woman " -lrb- 1966 -rrb- , aimée has always been close to the directors she worked with .
" frederico fellini and claude lelouch were my family , " she says , " just like a mother and father . "
both , together with robert altmann with whom she worked with in the film " ready to wear " in 1994 , gave her a sense of freedom she had never experienced before .
" i was n't free , but i felt it , " she says earnestly .
at the mercy of stardom born into a theatrical family , aimée began training in acting and danicing as a young girl at the bauer-theron school in paris .
at the age of 14 , she was elevated to stardom by the film " lovers of verona " -lrb- 1949 -rrb- which was especially written for her by french writer jacques prevert .
since then she has been dedicated to film , starring in movies in italy , france , britain and the u.s. and working with european film masters frederico fellini , jacques demy and claude lelouch .
it was in the film " la dolce vita " , in which aimée played the part of a nymphomaniac rich girl , starring alongside italian heartbreaker marcello mastroiani , that aimée gained her reputation as the femme fatale of classic european film .
never alone aimée gladly thinks back to the days with mastroiani .
" he was my favorite actor , " she recalls today , " simply the dream of a person , so funny and wonderful to work with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee in the film " lola " aimée is a woman who loves to laugh and for whom humor is one of the most important traits in life .
despite the death of director toscan du plantier only days ago , aimée , who is dressed from head to toe in black , still holds her head up high .
" it was a shock , and we have lost a good friend , " she says .
" but he is still here , all those we have lost are still with us . "
looking back at her life with the stars of 20th century european cinema , she says she has had a wonderful life , and does not regret a thing .
" there is not one day when i have regretted being myself .
indeed , i am lucky to be anouk aimée , and i like my life the way it is . "
more movies for the future , aimée plans making more films .
recently she starred in a german television feature , playing the part of napoleon 's mother .
this role was , however , an exception : aimée has never starred in a german film before .
" why ?
well , i would be so happy to do so , " she says with a radiant laugh .

this week , berlin welcomed the 67-year-old , who has starred in more than 70 classics , but is still hoping for a role in a german film . last christmas , berlinale film festival director dieter kosslick received a book on legendary film stars .
opening it for the first time , he was rewarded with the striking image of a young , dark-haired beauty gazing at him from the glossy page – an image he was never to forget .
such was his infatuation with the enchanting young lady – french actress anouk aimeé – that he resolved one day to meet her .
this week , kosslick 's dream came true : aimée is guest of honor at the berlinale film festival .
shielding herself from the bright winter 's sunlight with a large pair of dark glasses , aimée still has her star allure despite her 67 years of age .
elegantly removing the glasses , she flashes a small smile and says she has n't slept well .
earlier this week , french director daniel toscan du plantier died – for aimée the death of a close friend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee known for her roles in films including " la dolce vita " -lrb- 1960 -rrb- and " a man and a woman " -lrb- 1966 -rrb- , aimée has always been close to the directors she worked with .
" frederico fellini and claude lelouch were my family , " she says , " just like a mother and father . "
both , together with robert altmann with whom she worked with in the film " ready to wear " in 1994 , gave her a sense of freedom she had never experienced before .
" i was n't free , but i felt it , " she says earnestly .
at the mercy of stardom born into a theatrical family , aimée began training in acting and danicing as a young girl at the bauer-theron school in paris .
at the age of 14 , she was elevated to stardom by the film " lovers of verona " -lrb- 1949 -rrb- which was especially written for her by french writer jacques prevert .
since then she has been dedicated to film , starring in movies in italy , france , britain and the u.s. and working with european film masters frederico fellini , jacques demy and claude lelouch .
it was in the film " la dolce vita " , in which aimée played the part of a nymphomaniac rich girl , starring alongside italian heartbreaker marcello mastroiani , that aimée gained her reputation as the femme fatale of classic european film .
never alone aimée gladly thinks back to the days with mastroiani .
" he was my favorite actor , " she recalls today , " simply the dream of a person , so funny and wonderful to work with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee in the film " lola " aimée is a woman who loves to laugh and for whom humor is one of the most important traits in life .
despite the death of director toscan du plantier only days ago , aimée , who is dressed from head to toe in black , still holds her head up high .
" it was a shock , and we have lost a good friend , " she says .
" but he is still here , all those we have lost are still with us . "
looking back at her life with the stars of 20th century european cinema , she says she has had a wonderful life , and does not regret a thing .
" there is not one day when i have regretted being myself .
indeed , i am lucky to be anouk aimée , and i like my life the way it is . "
more movies for the future , aimée plans making more films .
recently she starred in a german television feature , playing the part of napoleon 's mother .
this role was , however , an exception : aimée has never starred in a german film before .
" why ?
well , i would be so happy to do so , " she says with a radiant laugh .
" but no german filmmaker has ever asked me ! "

this week , berlin welcomed the 67-year-old , who has starred in more than 70 classics , but is still hoping for a role in a german film . last christmas , berlinale film festival director dieter kosslick received a book on legendary film stars .
opening it for the first time , he was rewarded with the striking image of a young , dark-haired beauty gazing at him from the glossy page – an image he was never to forget .
such was his infatuation with the enchanting young lady – french actress anouk aimeé – that he resolved one day to meet her .
this week , kosslick 's dream came true : aimée is guest of honor at the berlinale film festival .
shielding herself from the bright winter 's sunlight with a large pair of dark glasses , aimée still has her star allure despite her 67 years of age .
elegantly removing the glasses , she flashes a small smile and says she has n't slept well .
earlier this week , french director daniel toscan du plantier died – for aimée the death of a close friend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee known for her roles in films including " la dolce vita " -lrb- 1960 -rrb- and " a man and a woman " -lrb- 1966 -rrb- , aimée has always been close to the directors she worked with .
" frederico fellini and claude lelouch were my family , " she says , " just like a mother and father . "
both , together with robert altmann with whom she worked with in the film " ready to wear " in 1994 , gave her a sense of freedom she had never experienced before .
" i was n't free , but i felt it , " she says earnestly .
at the mercy of stardom born into a theatrical family , aimée began training in acting and danicing as a young girl at the bauer-theron school in paris .
at the age of 14 , she was elevated to stardom by the film " lovers of verona " -lrb- 1949 -rrb- which was especially written for her by french writer jacques prevert .
since then she has been dedicated to film , starring in movies in italy , france , britain and the u.s. and working with european film masters frederico fellini , jacques demy and claude lelouch .
it was in the film " la dolce vita " , in which aimée played the part of a nymphomaniac rich girl , starring alongside italian heartbreaker marcello mastroiani , that aimée gained her reputation as the femme fatale of classic european film .
never alone aimée gladly thinks back to the days with mastroiani .
" he was my favorite actor , " she recalls today , " simply the dream of a person , so funny and wonderful to work with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee in the film " lola " aimée is a woman who loves to laugh and for whom humor is one of the most important traits in life .
despite the death of director toscan du plantier only days ago , aimée , who is dressed from head to toe in black , still holds her head up high .
" it was a shock , and we have lost a good friend , " she says .
" but he is still here , all those we have lost are still with us . "
looking back at her life with the stars of 20th century european cinema , she says she has had a wonderful life , and does not regret a thing .
" there is not one day when i have regretted being myself .
indeed , i am lucky to be anouk aimée , and i like my life the way it is . "
more movies for the future , aimée plans making more films .
recently she starred in a german television feature , playing the part of napoleon 's mother .
this role was , however , an exception : aimée has never starred in a german film before .
" why ?
well , i would be so happy to do so , " she says with a radiant laugh .
" but no german filmmaker has ever asked me ! "

this week , berlin welcomed the 67-year-old , who has starred in more than 70 classics , but is still hoping for a role in a german film . last christmas , berlinale film festival director dieter kosslick received a book on legendary film stars .
opening it for the first time , he was rewarded with the striking image of a young , dark-haired beauty gazing at him from the glossy page – an image he was never to forget .
such was his infatuation with the enchanting young lady – french actress anouk aimeé – that he resolved one day to meet her .
this week , kosslick 's dream came true : aimée is guest of honor at the berlinale film festival .
shielding herself from the bright winter 's sunlight with a large pair of dark glasses , aimée still has her star allure despite her 67 years of age .
elegantly removing the glasses , she flashes a small smile and says she has n't slept well .
earlier this week , french director daniel toscan du plantier died – for aimée the death of a close friend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee known for her roles in films including " la dolce vita " -lrb- 1960 -rrb- and " a man and a woman " -lrb- 1966 -rrb- , aimée has always been close to the directors she worked with .
" frederico fellini and claude lelouch were my family , " she says , " just like a mother and father . "
both , together with robert altmann with whom she worked with in the film " ready to wear " in 1994 , gave her a sense of freedom she had never experienced before .
" i was n't free , but i felt it , " she says earnestly .
at the mercy of stardom born into a theatrical family , aimée began training in acting and danicing as a young girl at the bauer-theron school in paris .
at the age of 14 , she was elevated to stardom by the film " lovers of verona " -lrb- 1949 -rrb- which was especially written for her by french writer jacques prevert .
since then she has been dedicated to film , starring in movies in italy , france , britain and the u.s. and working with european film masters frederico fellini , jacques demy and claude lelouch .
it was in the film " la dolce vita " , in which aimée played the part of a nymphomaniac rich girl , starring alongside italian heartbreaker marcello mastroiani , that aimée gained her reputation as the femme fatale of classic european film .
never alone aimée gladly thinks back to the days with mastroiani .
" he was my favorite actor , " she recalls today , " simply the dream of a person , so funny and wonderful to work with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee in the film " lola " aimée is a woman who loves to laugh and for whom humor is one of the most important traits in life .
despite the death of director toscan du plantier only days ago , aimée , who is dressed from head to toe in black , still holds her head up high .
" it was a shock , and we have lost a good friend , " she says .
" but he is still here , all those we have lost are still with us . "
looking back at her life with the stars of 20th century european cinema , she says she has had a wonderful life , and does not regret a thing .
" there is not one day when i have regretted being myself .
indeed , i am lucky to be anouk aimée , and i like my life the way it is . "
more movies for the future , aimée plans making more films .
recently she starred in a german television feature , playing the part of napoleon 's mother .
this role was , however , an exception : aimée has never starred in a german film before .
" why ?
well , i would be so happy to do so , " she says with a radiant laugh .
" but no german filmmaker has ever asked me ! "

it was in the film " la dolce vita " , in which aimée played the part of a nymphomaniac rich girl , starring alongside italian heartbreaker marcello mastroiani , that aimée gained her reputation as the femme fatale of classic european film .
never alone aimée gladly thinks back to the days with mastroiani .
" he was my favorite actor , " she recalls today , " simply the dream of a person , so funny and wonderful to work with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee in the film " lola " aimée is a woman who loves to laugh and for whom humor is one of the most important traits in life .
despite the death of director toscan du plantier only days ago , aimée , who is dressed from head to toe in black , still holds her head up high .
" it was a shock , and we have lost a good friend , " she says .
" but he is still here , all those we have lost are still with us . "
looking back at her life with the stars of 20th century european cinema , she says she has had a wonderful life , and does not regret a thing .
" there is not one day when i have regretted being myself .
indeed , i am lucky to be anouk aimée , and i like my life the way it is . "
more movies for the future , aimée plans making more films .
recently she starred in a german television feature , playing the part of napoleon 's mother .
this role was , however , an exception : aimée has never starred in a german film before .
" why ?
well , i would be so happy to do so , " she says with a radiant laugh .
" but no german filmmaker has ever asked me ! "

this week , berlin welcomed the 67-year-old , who has starred in more than 70 classics , but is still hoping for a role in a german film . last christmas , berlinale film festival director dieter kosslick received a book on legendary film stars .
opening it for the first time , he was rewarded with the striking image of a young , dark-haired beauty gazing at him from the glossy page – an image he was never to forget .
such was his infatuation with the enchanting young lady – french actress anouk aimeé – that he resolved one day to meet her .
this week , kosslick 's dream came true : aimée is guest of honor at the berlinale film festival .
shielding herself from the bright winter 's sunlight with a large pair of dark glasses , aimée still has her star allure despite her 67 years of age .
elegantly removing the glasses , she flashes a small smile and says she has n't slept well .
earlier this week , french director daniel toscan du plantier died – for aimée the death of a close friend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee known for her roles in films including " la dolce vita " -lrb- 1960 -rrb- and " a man and a woman " -lrb- 1966 -rrb- , aimée has always been close to the directors she worked with .
" frederico fellini and claude lelouch were my family , " she says , " just like a mother and father . "
both , together with robert altmann with whom she worked with in the film " ready to wear " in 1994 , gave her a sense of freedom she had never experienced before .
" i was n't free , but i felt it , " she says earnestly .
at the mercy of stardom born into a theatrical family , aimée began training in acting and danicing as a young girl at the bauer-theron school in paris .
at the age of 14 , she was elevated to stardom by the film " lovers of verona " -lrb- 1949 -rrb- which was especially written for her by french writer jacques prevert .
since then she has been dedicated to film , starring in movies in italy , france , britain and the u.s. and working with european film masters frederico fellini , jacques demy and claude lelouch .
it was in the film " la dolce vita " , in which aimée played the part of a nymphomaniac rich girl , starring alongside italian heartbreaker marcello mastroiani , that aimée gained her reputation as the femme fatale of classic european film .
never alone aimée gladly thinks back to the days with mastroiani .
" he was my favorite actor , " she recalls today , " simply the dream of a person , so funny and wonderful to work with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee in the film " lola " aimée is a woman who loves to laugh and for whom humor is one of the most important traits in life .
despite the death of director toscan du plantier only days ago , aimée , who is dressed from head to toe in black , still holds her head up high .
" it was a shock , and we have lost a good friend , " she says .
" but he is still here , all those we have lost are still with us . "
looking back at her life with the stars of 20th century european cinema , she says she has had a wonderful life , and does not regret a thing .
" there is not one day when i have regretted being myself .
indeed , i am lucky to be anouk aimée , and i like my life the way it is . "

recently she starred in a german television feature , playing the part of napoleon 's mother .
this role was , however , an exception : aimée has never starred in a german film before .
" why ?

this week , berlin welcomed the 67-year-old , who has starred in more than 70 classics , but is still hoping for a role in a german film . last christmas , berlinale film festival director dieter kosslick received a book on legendary film stars .
opening it for the first time , he was rewarded with the striking image of a young , dark-haired beauty gazing at him from the glossy page – an image he was never to forget .
such was his infatuation with the enchanting young lady – french actress anouk aimeé – that he resolved one day to meet her .
this week , kosslick 's dream came true : aimée is guest of honor at the berlinale film festival .
shielding herself from the bright winter 's sunlight with a large pair of dark glasses , aimée still has her star allure despite her 67 years of age .
elegantly removing the glasses , she flashes a small smile and says she has n't slept well .
earlier this week , french director daniel toscan du plantier died – for aimée the death of a close friend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee known for her roles in films including " la dolce vita " -lrb- 1960 -rrb- and " a man and a woman " -lrb- 1966 -rrb- , aimée has always been close to the directors she worked with .
" frederico fellini and claude lelouch were my family , " she says , " just like a mother and father . "
both , together with robert altmann with whom she worked with in the film " ready to wear " in 1994 , gave her a sense of freedom she had never experienced before .
" i was n't free , but i felt it , " she says earnestly .
at the mercy of stardom born into a theatrical family , aimée began training in acting and danicing as a young girl at the bauer-theron school in paris .
at the age of 14 , she was elevated to stardom by the film " lovers of verona " -lrb- 1949 -rrb- which was especially written for her by french writer jacques prevert .
since then she has been dedicated to film , starring in movies in italy , france , britain and the u.s. and working with european film masters frederico fellini , jacques demy and claude lelouch .
it was in the film " la dolce vita " , in which aimée played the part of a nymphomaniac rich girl , starring alongside italian heartbreaker marcello mastroiani , that aimée gained her reputation as the femme fatale of classic european film .
never alone aimée gladly thinks back to the days with mastroiani .
" he was my favorite actor , " she recalls today , " simply the dream of a person , so funny and wonderful to work with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee in the film " lola " aimée is a woman who loves to laugh and for whom humor is one of the most important traits in life .
despite the death of director toscan du plantier only days ago , aimée , who is dressed from head to toe in black , still holds her head up high .
" it was a shock , and we have lost a good friend , " she says .
" but he is still here , all those we have lost are still with us . "
looking back at her life with the stars of 20th century european cinema , she says she has had a wonderful life , and does not regret a thing .
" there is not one day when i have regretted being myself .
indeed , i am lucky to be anouk aimée , and i like my life the way it is . "
more movies for the future , aimée plans making more films .
recently she starred in a german television feature , playing the part of napoleon 's mother .
this role was , however , an exception : aimée has never starred in a german film before .
" why ?
well , i would be so happy to do so , " she says with a radiant laugh .
" but no german filmmaker has ever asked me ! "

this week , berlin welcomed the 67-year-old , who has starred in more than 70 classics , but is still hoping for a role in a german film . last christmas , berlinale film festival director dieter kosslick received a book on legendary film stars .
opening it for the first time , he was rewarded with the striking image of a young , dark-haired beauty gazing at him from the glossy page – an image he was never to forget .
such was his infatuation with the enchanting young lady – french actress anouk aimeé – that he resolved one day to meet her .
this week , kosslick 's dream came true : aimée is guest of honor at the berlinale film festival .
shielding herself from the bright winter 's sunlight with a large pair of dark glasses , aimée still has her star allure despite her 67 years of age .
elegantly removing the glasses , she flashes a small smile and says she has n't slept well .
earlier this week , french director daniel toscan du plantier died – for aimée the death of a close friend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee known for her roles in films including " la dolce vita " -lrb- 1960 -rrb- and " a man and a woman " -lrb- 1966 -rrb- , aimée has always been close to the directors she worked with .
" frederico fellini and claude lelouch were my family , " she says , " just like a mother and father . "
both , together with robert altmann with whom she worked with in the film " ready to wear " in 1994 , gave her a sense of freedom she had never experienced before .
" i was n't free , but i felt it , " she says earnestly .
at the mercy of stardom born into a theatrical family , aimée began training in acting and danicing as a young girl at the bauer-theron school in paris .
at the age of 14 , she was elevated to stardom by the film " lovers of verona " -lrb- 1949 -rrb- which was especially written for her by french writer jacques prevert .
since then she has been dedicated to film , starring in movies in italy , france , britain and the u.s. and working with european film masters frederico fellini , jacques demy and claude lelouch .
it was in the film " la dolce vita " , in which aimée played the part of a nymphomaniac rich girl , starring alongside italian heartbreaker marcello mastroiani , that aimée gained her reputation as the femme fatale of classic european film .
never alone aimée gladly thinks back to the days with mastroiani .
" he was my favorite actor , " she recalls today , " simply the dream of a person , so funny and wonderful to work with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee in the film " lola " aimée is a woman who loves to laugh and for whom humor is one of the most important traits in life .
despite the death of director toscan du plantier only days ago , aimée , who is dressed from head to toe in black , still holds her head up high .
" it was a shock , and we have lost a good friend , " she says .
" but he is still here , all those we have lost are still with us . "
looking back at her life with the stars of 20th century european cinema , she says she has had a wonderful life , and does not regret a thing .
" there is not one day when i have regretted being myself .
indeed , i am lucky to be anouk aimée , and i like my life the way it is . "
more movies for the future , aimée plans making more films .
recently she starred in a german television feature , playing the part of napoleon 's mother .
this role was , however , an exception : aimée has never starred in a german film before .
" why ?
well , i would be so happy to do so , " she says with a radiant laugh .

this week , berlin welcomed the 67-year-old , who has starred in more than 70 classics , but is still hoping for a role in a german film . last christmas , berlinale film festival director dieter kosslick received a book on legendary film stars .
opening it for the first time , he was rewarded with the striking image of a young , dark-haired beauty gazing at him from the glossy page – an image he was never to forget .
such was his infatuation with the enchanting young lady – french actress anouk aimeé – that he resolved one day to meet her .
this week , kosslick 's dream came true : aimée is guest of honor at the berlinale film festival .
shielding herself from the bright winter 's sunlight with a large pair of dark glasses , aimée still has her star allure despite her 67 years of age .
elegantly removing the glasses , she flashes a small smile and says she has n't slept well .
earlier this week , french director daniel toscan du plantier died – for aimée the death of a close friend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee known for her roles in films including " la dolce vita " -lrb- 1960 -rrb- and " a man and a woman " -lrb- 1966 -rrb- , aimée has always been close to the directors she worked with .
" frederico fellini and claude lelouch were my family , " she says , " just like a mother and father . "
both , together with robert altmann with whom she worked with in the film " ready to wear " in 1994 , gave her a sense of freedom she had never experienced before .
" i was n't free , but i felt it , " she says earnestly .
at the mercy of stardom born into a theatrical family , aimée began training in acting and danicing as a young girl at the bauer-theron school in paris .
at the age of 14 , she was elevated to stardom by the film " lovers of verona " -lrb- 1949 -rrb- which was especially written for her by french writer jacques prevert .
since then she has been dedicated to film , starring in movies in italy , france , britain and the u.s. and working with european film masters frederico fellini , jacques demy and claude lelouch .
it was in the film " la dolce vita " , in which aimée played the part of a nymphomaniac rich girl , starring alongside italian heartbreaker marcello mastroiani , that aimée gained her reputation as the femme fatale of classic european film .
never alone aimée gladly thinks back to the days with mastroiani .
" he was my favorite actor , " she recalls today , " simply the dream of a person , so funny and wonderful to work with . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anouk aimee in the film " lola " aimée is a woman who loves to laugh and for whom humor is one of the most important traits in life .
despite the death of director toscan du plantier only days ago , aimée , who is dressed from head to toe in black , still holds her head up high .
" it was a shock , and we have lost a good friend , " she says .
" but he is still here , all those we have lost are still with us . "
looking back at her life with the stars of 20th century european cinema , she says she has had a wonderful life , and does not regret a thing .
" there is not one day when i have regretted being myself .
indeed , i am lucky to be anouk aimée , and i like my life the way it is . "
more movies for the future , aimée plans making more films .
recently she starred in a german television feature , playing the part of napoleon 's mother .
this role was , however , an exception : aimée has never starred in a german film before .
" why ?
well , i would be so happy to do so , " she says with a radiant laugh .
" but no german filmmaker has ever asked me ! "

the hardline military organisation , which answers directly to iran 's current supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , said that the original fatwa , issued in 1989 following the publication of mr rushdie 's novel " the satanic verses " , was still valid .
" the historical decree on salman rushdie is irrevocable and nothing can change it , " said a statement carried by iran 's official irna news agency .
iran 's current president , the moderate mohammad khatami , has said that the death sentence should be seen as closed .
however hardliners within the country have occasionally renewed their calls for mr rushdie 's death for writing a novel , which they have denounced as blasphemous .
these calls have continued despite the iranian government publicly committing itself in 1998 to not carrying out the death sentence , a decision which led to a deal between iran and the uk to normalise relations .
gradual re-emergence the british foreign office said that the statement was " not the first time that statements have been made that are contrary to oft-repeated official iranian policy " .
it also reiterated iran 's 1998 decision not " take any action whatsoever , to threaten the life of the author of the satanic verses or anyone associated with his work " .
since 1989 rushdie has received round-the-clock protection in the uk as a result of the iranian government 's fatwa .
the writer had to keep his whereabouts secret and he ended up living in 30 different locations in the uk over nine years .
however after current iranian government distanced itself from the fatwa , rushdie has begun to emerge more frequently in public , even appearing in the hit hollywood movie bridget jones 's diary .

instead of inviting bids from other net groups to run the net 's core addressing system the us department of commerce has simply extended icann 's hold for a further three years .
european and us net firms have criticised the decision and say they could do a much better job of running the net 's core address system .
firms are now lobbying for the chance to take over the addressing system .
contract bridge icann , the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers , was created in late 1998 to take over the net oversight functions that previously lay with the us government . "
the iana function is one of the key internet administrative functions , and helps insure the stability , security , and reliability of the internet " carl malamud , internet multicasting service the corporation was supposed to help the administration of the net become more international and open .
one of icann 's main tasks is overseeing the internet assigned numbers authority that holds master lists of who runs which domain .
for example , in britain nominet runs the .uk domain .
the contract covering iana administration is due for renewal in april this year .
in late january the us department of commerce announced its intention to simply let icann carry on administering iana under a single-source , no-fee contract .
european and us firms have condemned the decision and said such an important job should be the subject of competitive bids .
voices of criticism one of the first to criticise the decision was willie black , chairman of nominet .
mr black said iana should be split from icann to separate the organisations administrative role from its policy-making job .
carl malamud , head of the internet multicasting service , issued an open letter asking the department of commerce to reconsider .
" the iana function is one of the key internet administrative functions , and helps insure the stability , security , and reliability of the internet , " he wrote .
mr malamud said the techniques iana used to administer its database had not changed in 20 years and were sorely in need of updating .

instead of inviting bids from other net groups to run the net 's core addressing system the us department of commerce has simply extended icann 's hold for a further three years .
european and us net firms have criticised the decision and say they could do a much better job of running the net 's core address system .
firms are now lobbying for the chance to take over the addressing system .
contract bridge icann , the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers , was created in late 1998 to take over the net oversight functions that previously lay with the us government .
the iana function is one of the key internet administrative functions , and helps insure the stability , security , and reliability of the internet carl malamud , internet multicasting service the corporation was supposed to help the administration of the net become more international and open .
one of icann 's main tasks is overseeing the internet assigned numbers authority that holds master lists of who runs which domain .
for example , in britain nominet runs the .uk domain .
the contract covering iana administration is due for renewal in april this year .
in late january the us department of commerce announced its intention to simply let icann carry on administering iana under a single-source , no-fee contract .
european and us firms have condemned the decision and said such an important job should be the subject of competitive bids .
voices of criticism one of the first to criticise the decision was willie black , chairman of nominet .
mr black said iana should be split from icann to separate the organisations administrative role from its policy-making job .
carl malamud , head of the internet multicasting service , issued an open letter asking the department of commerce to reconsider .
" the iana function is one of the key internet administrative functions , and helps insure the stability , security , and reliability of the internet , " he wrote .
mr malamud said the techniques iana used to administer its database had not changed in 20 years and were sorely in need of updating .
he said the ims wants a chance to bid for the iana job .
centr , the organisation that represents administrators of european domains , said its too was interested in running iana because its members made up a significant proportion of the organisations held in the database .

homer simpson may be dumb .
but sometimes it is survival of the stupidest .
the simpsons have hit their 300th episode after a tv career of 13 years and counting .
and the cartoon family that became global icons will run until at least 2005 , its creators say .
clueless dad homer , wise mother marge , and the simpson children - tearaway bart , genius lisa and clumsy infant maggie - show no signs of falling out of favour .
" i hope it goes on forever " animated encounters director kieran argo what is the simpson 's secret ?
how have they triumphed when live action shows like frasier and friends start to sag , or see their audiences deserting when the actors are n't quite so fresh faced ?
part of the reason is its writing , says the director of britain 's leading animation festival .
kieran argo , festival director of animated encounters , brought creator matt groening to the uk last year .
he says the show is still consistently one of the most creative on television .
" one of the most striking things about it is the quality of its scripts .
they have a very intensive scriptwriting session , and they use a lot of writers .
" it 's also the fact the they 've broadened the show to be less about bart and more about homer , " argo says .
the show 's minor characters , like the cynical children 's show host krusty the clown or bart 's friend milhouse , are fleshed out as much as the simpson family .
" you really do get to know each character , even the minor ones like itchy and scratchy -lsb- the violent cartoon show beloved of bart and lisa -rsb- , " he says .
" there is an irreverence there , and i think it 's always healthy to have a bit of irony , some slight cynicism .
and at the same time i love the way touches on serious subjects like ecology .
" i hope it goes on forever , " he says .
animated shorts there was very little hint of how big the simpsons would become when they started life .
the crudely drawn shorts which started on tracey ullmann 's us tv show in 1987 were an animated oddity amidst the british comedienne 's sketches .
groening , a cartoonist best known for his dark , foreboding strip life is hell , started the short animations as a parody of american family life .
those first shorts were much less surreal than the full-length show , which first aired in 1990 .
homer was based heavily on groening 's own father , and seemed not so far removed from a normal family man .
now , poor old homer is , as his voice actor dan castellaneta once said , " a dog trapped in a man 's body " .
the first seasons had bart centre-stage .
the simpson ' was a vehicle for the mischievous 10-year old 's dennis the menace-styled antics .
now , homer and his bizarre situations are the focus .
argo believes that change in emphasis has also breathed fresh life into the show .
bart used to be the focus of the show " i do n't think it 's a derivative of anything that 's gone before , " he says .
" it 's so strong because it is unique . "
in fact , the madcap style of later simpson has been a big influence not only one other animations , but on new live actions comedies like malcolm in the middle .
even rock stars and hollywood actors can not resist the programme .
mel gibson , michelle pfeiffer , alec baldwin , three beatles and u2 have been among the celebrities clamouring to play themselves .
" the fact that hollywood celebrities are so desperate to get on the show shows how cool it is , " says argo .
" it seems that it 's the thing to get - they 're not someone till they 've been on the simpsons . "
audiences for its new series - its 14th - are up by 12 % in the us .
recent figures show that nearly a quarter of sky one subscribers - the channel that first airs new simpsons episodes in the uk - do so simply to watch the show .
and channel 4 recently won a bidding war to show the programme on terrestrial tv - at the tune of £ 700,000 an episode .
as far as argo is concerned , it 's money well spent .
" the show is worth every penny , " he says .

they had been invited by ghana 's president john kufuor to discuss rebel participation in a coalition government for ivory coast .
we realise there is an impasse that we must break through , sooner rather than later sidiki konate , rebel spokesman the issue threatens to derail the agreement reached at peace negotiations in france last month .
rebels maintain that the deal promised them key ministries , but ivorian president laurent gbagbo - who also signed the accord - insists he must have the final say on government appointments .
the french-brokered deal has sparked furious protests in abidjan the main northern rebel group - the patriotic movement of ivory coast -lrb- mcpi -rrb- has given mr gbagbo until midnight on sunday -lrb- local time -rrb- to appoint its nominees to the cabinet or face an attack on the commercial capital , abidjan .
two rebel factions based in western ivory coast did not send representatives to the talks in the capital of neighbouring ghana , the current head of the regional grouping ecowas -lrb- economic community of west african states -rrb- .
meanwhile , in a boost in abidjan for prime minister seydou diarra , the former ruling pcdi - the biggest party in parliament - broke ranks with other leading parties by urging that the french-brokered accord be implemented in full .
closed-door the ghanaian president chaired the meeting between mr diarra - who was formally appointed earlier this week - and three representatives of the mpci .
diarra , a northern muslim , was chosen by gbagbo a ghanaian spokesman was quoted as saying president kufuor was " more determined than ever before " to see to a speedy and peaceful resolution of the issues , " and he will go any length to achieve the required consensus for the way forward . "
rebel spokesman , sidiki konate , was quoted by reuters news agency after the talks as saying : " we realise there is an impasse that we must break through , sooner rather than later . "
officials said the sides planned to return home separately on saturday after spending the night in accra .
the talks followed a second rebel warning in a week that fighting would resume if president gbagbo failed to implement january 's deal including them in a unity government .
they have also said that if need be , they are prepared to take on french troops currently deployed in ivory coast to protect western nationals and monitor a shaky ceasefire .
victims of conflict the rebels insist that under the deal , they were promised the defence and interior portfolios - a prospect that triggered two weeks of riots by pro-government supporters in abidjan .
gbabgo 's supporters say they will not accept rebels in the government in a long-awaited national address last week , mr gbagbo said the make-up of the new government had not been decided and that his decision on the issue was final .
the mpci took control of northern ivory coast after fighting followed a failed coup against president gbagbo in september .
other factions later emerged in the west of the country and took territory .
it is estimated that thousands of people have been killed and more than one million forced to leave their homes .

scientists at the roslin institute in midlothian , where dolly was kept , said she would eventually be put on public display at the national museum of scotland in edinburgh .
the six-year-old sheep died on friday after a decision was taken to " euthanase " her on the grounds that a veterinary examination showed she had a progressive lung disease .
dolly 's birth on 5 july 1996 was a scientific landmark , but also provoked an ethical debate on the morality of cloning and its applications .
professor ian wilmut , who led the roslin team which created dolly , said the early indications were that she had simply contracted a progressive lung disease from other animals in a shared pen .
" there is always a greater risk if you have animals inside that infections will spread , so we had been concerned about this , " he said .
" it 's a very slow , progressive illness but we wo n't know the details until a post-mortem examination at the local vet school has been completed with any tests they want to do .
" obviously we will publicise the results of any significant findings from that post-mortem . "
professor wilmut said that once appropriate tests had been carried out dolly would be put on display .
" once the -lrb- post-mortem -rrb- examination has been made , the opportunity will be given to the scottish museum to preserve her .
" there is already one of our cloned animals on display there and in a few months time dolly will join her . "

ysgol brynrefail , llanrug , is one of the few schools in the area without a footpath leading to the school .
there is no pavement leading to the school the pupils have put forward their case for action through the safe routes to school scheme .
the children hope they can present a powerful argument to secure welsh assembly government funding to build a pavement - which is set to cost about £ 50,000 .
" the road is very narrow anyway in terms of traffic - never mind the fact that children have to walk on it , " said brynrefail 's headmaster , eifion jones .
" it is terrifically busy in the morning and evening and so there is an urgent need for the situation to be corrected , " he said .
more traffic the overall problem has existed for years but has been worsened recently by a substantial increase in traffic .
" i am concerned that the responsibility lies with the school and that now we need to go through a great deal of bureaucracy in order to get results , " said mr jones .
" i realise that a great many road improvement applications are submitted , so the council needs to prioritise .
through some luck there has n't been an accident on the road leading to the school headmaster eifion jones " they then look at the number of accidents to have occurred on the various roads .
" through some luck there has n't been an accident on the road leading to the school , so the priority is then lowered despite the obvious need , " he said .
the building of a car park within the school grounds is another measure which has been agreed in order to reduce congestion on the road .
not acceptable " the situation just is n't good enough , " said cllr charles wyn jones .
" the fact that children have to walk in the road is unacceptable and a solution should be found as soon as possible , " he added .
following a meeting between the school , the community and council officers , ysgol brynrefail and the local primary school are in the process of preparing their case for funding .
the council 's highways department is looking at the most practical options for making a bid for money from the safe routes to school programme .
ysgol brynrefail governors , along with local primary school staff , have called a community meeting to collate evidence to support their funding application .

devon county council says the growing population in the county is putting more pressure on devon 's stock of social housing .
devon has had a growth in population of 17.6 % since 1981 .
this adds up to a demand for more and more accommodation - but the stock of social housing in the county has not increased in the last 10 years , the council says .
fastest growing the total population of the county was officially recorded at 1,074,919 , including the plymouth and torbay unitary authorities , on census day on 29 april 2001 - an increase of 105,300 people .
this made it the fastest growing county in the fastest growing region of england , according to the census .
the south west grew by 12.5 % from 1981 to 2001 , compared with an average rate for england of 5 % .
to make things more difficult , the number of people living alone has risen by more than a quarter .
average earnings according to council figures in 1971 , a population of 100,000 needed 36,600 dwellings to accommodate them .
in 2001 , the same population now needs 43,700 .
devon county council wants to see at least a third of all new homes being built in in the county being made affordable for local people .
average earnings in devon are currently among the lowest in the country , at around £ 20,000 .
the average house price in the county is around £ 140,000 , seven times the average salary .
