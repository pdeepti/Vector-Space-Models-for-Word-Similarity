haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .
the long protective market will now experience measured influence from foreign investors via saban .
" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .
" we look forward to completing the transaction . "
his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .

the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .
the attempted hijacking of the deal fell through when apax 's partner , the carlyle group , dropped out leaving the road clear for saban .

german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .
but saban had other ideas and bauer was elbowed aside , leaving the american to sign a deal in march .
however , that attempt failed in june after saban had problems with financing .
his determination to get into the german market , however , never waivered .
" i would have tried -lrb- to buy prosieben -rrb- ten times if i had failed nine times , " saban said according to the german news agency dpa .
a kirch spokesman said the deal is expected to be signed in the next few days .
once the deal is closed , saban is set to also make a public offer to buy prosieben 's listed preference shares for a price around the minimum legally possible , which stands at € 5.60-5.65 .

as if to emphasis the point further , the summer transfer market in germany was relatively quiet with the big clubs seemingly satisfied with their current squads as the season came closer to kick off .
even the champions were spending thriftily on the eve of their title defense .
that is until this week when bayern munich revealed on monday that dutch striker roy makaay would be joining them from deportivo la coruna in spain for an undisclosed sum .
the fee is rumored to be somewhere between deportivo ’ s estimated € 20 million -lrb- $ 22.61million -rrb- price tag and bayern ’ s offer of € 16 million , with some voices whispering that it could be the second most expensive in the league ’ s 40-year history .
the 28-year-old could start repaying that financial layout when he makes his debut in the bundesliga game at hanover 96 on saturday , august 9 .
euro hopes boosted by arrival makaay , who won the golden boot award for europe 's top scorer last season , after netting 29 goals in 38 league matches for deportivo , joins the bavarian giants in a four-year deal as they prepare to defend their standing as number one in the bundesliga and steel themselves for another assault on the european champions league .

deal completed in nick of time makaay will now be eligible for bayern ’ s champions league games as the deal went through before deportivo played in the third qualifying round of the tournament which takes place on august 13 .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said earlier in the week that if deportivo registered makaay for the champions league , the transfer would have been called off ; such is the club ’ s desire to build their european campaign around him .
makaay ’ s arrival will also spark a competition for places in the team as the current first choice striking duo is made up of giovanni elber and claudio pizzaro .

haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .
the long protective market will now experience measured influence from foreign investors via saban .
" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .
" we look forward to completing the transaction . "
his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .
but it wo n't likely be reflected when prosieben ceo urs rohner releases the figures for the first half of the year this thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haim saban backed by private equity firms , saban 's offer of € 7.50 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per share for the 72 percent of unlisted but vote-wielding ordinary stock was accepted just two months after his first attempt failed .
the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .
the attempted hijacking of the deal fell through when apax 's partner , the carlyle group , dropped out leaving the road clear for saban .
" the vote -lrb- for saban 's bid -rrb- was unanimous , " said a spokesman for kirchmedia .
kirch 's crown jewel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch the creditors in charge of the bankrupt company 's crown jewel have been trying to sell prosiebensat.1 for over a year .
during that time , they attempted to offload the group a number of times in a bid to recover some of the billions of euros they had lent leo kirch , turning the on-going saga surrounding the bidding war into a turbulent auction .
german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .
but saban had other ideas and bauer was elbowed aside , leaving the american to sign a deal in march .
however , that attempt failed in june after saban had problems with financing .
his determination to get into the german market , however , never waivered .
" i would have tried -lrb- to buy prosieben -rrb- ten times if i had failed nine times , " saban said according to the german news agency dpa .
a kirch spokesman said the deal is expected to be signed in the next few days .
once the deal is closed , saban is set to also make a public offer to buy prosieben 's listed preference shares for a price around the minimum legally possible , which stands at € 5.60-5.65 .
his title of number one challenger to the german and european media crowns will then be officially recognized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. billionare set to take over bankrupt german media group one of america 's most successful media entrepreneurs , haim saban , has seen off the competition in the battle to take over the bankrupt german kirchmedia group .
his main rival , bauer , threw in the towel on wednesday .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.08.2003 makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former thorn in the side becomes a rose in the bayern garden bayern munich pulled out all the stops to secure the signing of dutch international striker roy makaay in an attempt to mount a more serious assault on the european champions league this season . it ’ s a well known fact that german soccer clubs have been experiencing financial woes in the wake of the television rights crisis that has plagued the bundesliga for the past two seasons .
as if to emphasis the point further , the summer transfer market in germany was relatively quiet with the big clubs seemingly satisfied with their current squads as the season came closer to kick off .
even the champions were spending thriftily on the eve of their title defense .
that is until this week when bayern munich revealed on monday that dutch striker roy makaay would be joining them from deportivo la coruna in spain for an undisclosed sum .
the fee is rumored to be somewhere between deportivo ’ s estimated € 20 million -lrb- $ 22.61million -rrb- price tag and bayern ’ s offer of € 16 million , with some voices whispering that it could be the second most expensive in the league ’ s 40-year history .
the 28-year-old could start repaying that financial layout when he makes his debut in the bundesliga game at hanover 96 on saturday , august 9 .
euro hopes boosted by arrival makaay , who won the golden boot award for europe 's top scorer last season , after netting 29 goals in 38 league matches for deportivo , joins the bavarian giants in a four-year deal as they prepare to defend their standing as number one in the bundesliga and steel themselves for another assault on the european champions league .
after the disappointment of last season ’ s short-lived european adventure , makaay ’ s arrival is expected to strengthen the team as bayern goes up against the likes of real madrid , juventus turin and manchester united .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern will be hoping for a better european challenge this year .
the irony will not be lost on the many bayern fans who have enthusiastically welcomed makaay to the club .
makaay was instrumental in setting the wreaking ball in motion on bayern ’ s ill-fated and disastrous foray into last season ’ s champions league campaign .
as the main danger man for deportivo , makaay scored three times in the olympic stadium as bayern opened their campaign with a 3-2 defeat to the primera league team and consequently failed in their attempt to reach the second phase of the competition .
deal completed in nick of time makaay will now be eligible for bayern ’ s champions league games as the deal went through before deportivo played in the third qualifying round of the tournament which takes place on august 13 .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said earlier in the week that if deportivo registered makaay for the champions league , the transfer would have been called off ; such is the club ’ s desire to build their european campaign around him .
makaay ’ s arrival will also spark a competition for places in the team as the current first choice striking duo is made up of giovanni elber and claudio pizzaro .
but as the club 's supervisory board chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday , " i am certain that we need a third top striker alongside elber and pizarro for a long season . "
beckenbauer wields his influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer rates makaay highly .
beckenbauer was personally involved in persuading commercial manager uli hoeness to pursue makaay , saying during the transfer negotiations that the club should meet deportivo ’ s conditions if they wanted to capture the dutchman ’ s signature .
" such a player would be an enrichment for bayern and the entire bundesliga .
whether we have to pay a million more is not important . "
it ’ s no surprise that makaay is such a coveted player .
the dutchman started his career at vitesse arnhem in his native country where he scored 11 goals in his first full season during the 1995/96 campaign .
he almost doubled that tally in his last season in holland before moving to tenerife where he managed only 21 goals in his two years with the club .
things really took off when makaay joined deportivo in 1999 .
accustomed to honors as well as scoring 79 league goals in four seasons with the club and nine times in last season 's champions league , makaay also won the liga title and the spanish super cup in 2000 and the spanish copa del rey and a second super cup in 2002 .
bayern will be hoping that makaay ’ s expertise will help them to secure more honors at home and abroad . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de another easy bundesliga title for bayern ?

in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture . "
a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?
and how can they handle this enormous task at a time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs ?
are these issues better tackled through traditional or digital means ?
the prevailing consensus at the congress : neither the pixel nor the printed word will prevail , but the problems are best solved by a mixture of both .
" the library of the future will be a hybrid , " says library director georg ruppelt .
" the hybrid library allows electronic access to everything possible , but printed books will remain . "
thus , digital and analog will coexist peacefully side-by-side .
mirroring this statement , jürgen seefeldt and ludger syre submitted a paper describing the library of 2015 .
according to them , the initial experience with digital technology has failed to entirely displace the book and that will continue to be the case .
it seems that no one really wants to read earnestly for long periods of time in an electronic library .
a strategic alliance librarians hope to maximize the advantages of both traditional books and technology in a strategic alliance .
instead of an unwieldy card catalog , they foresee efficient networked databases , with access to the reserves of libraries around the world .
yet the old-school stacks will remain , including the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book " and all the other tactile elements .
ideally , both will be stored in an aesthetically pleasing space - a library that can serve as a social meeting place .
so , at the world library and information congress at least , the battle between the printed word and the pixel has been resolved through a peaceful co-existence , with each medium retained to suit its ideal purpose .
traditional bibliophiles can keep their books and techno-fans can have their pixels .
and maybe that 's the way it will go in the consumer market .

in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture . "
a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?
and how can they handle this enormous task at a time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs ?
are these issues better tackled through traditional or digital means ?
the prevailing consensus at the congress : neither the pixel nor the printed word will prevail , but the problems are best solved by a mixture of both .
" the library of the future will be a hybrid , " says library director georg ruppelt .
" the hybrid library allows electronic access to everything possible , but printed books will remain . "
thus , digital and analog will coexist peacefully side-by-side .
mirroring this statement , jürgen seefeldt and ludger syre submitted a paper describing the library of 2015 .
according to them , the initial experience with digital technology has failed to entirely displace the book and that will continue to be the case .
it seems that no one really wants to read earnestly for long periods of time in an electronic library .

haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .
the long protective market will now experience measured influence from foreign investors via saban .
" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .
" we look forward to completing the transaction . "
his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .
but it wo n't likely be reflected when prosieben ceo urs rohner releases the figures for the first half of the year this thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haim saban backed by private equity firms , saban 's offer of € 7.50 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per share for the 72 percent of unlisted but vote-wielding ordinary stock was accepted just two months after his first attempt failed .
the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .
the attempted hijacking of the deal fell through when apax 's partner , the carlyle group , dropped out leaving the road clear for saban .
" the vote -lrb- for saban 's bid -rrb- was unanimous , " said a spokesman for kirchmedia .
kirch 's crown jewel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch the creditors in charge of the bankrupt company 's crown jewel have been trying to sell prosiebensat.1 for over a year .
during that time , they attempted to offload the group a number of times in a bid to recover some of the billions of euros they had lent leo kirch , turning the on-going saga surrounding the bidding war into a turbulent auction .
german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .
but saban had other ideas and bauer was elbowed aside , leaving the american to sign a deal in march .
however , that attempt failed in june after saban had problems with financing .
his determination to get into the german market , however , never waivered .
" i would have tried -lrb- to buy prosieben -rrb- ten times if i had failed nine times , " saban said according to the german news agency dpa .
a kirch spokesman said the deal is expected to be signed in the next few days .
once the deal is closed , saban is set to also make a public offer to buy prosieben 's listed preference shares for a price around the minimum legally possible , which stands at € 5.60-5.65 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.08.2003 turkey pushes forward on eu reform course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demands for change are growing , especially among turkey 's kurdish minority .
in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership . turkish president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday approved an amnesty law for kurdish rebels once engaged in a vicious war in the south-east of the country .
the law , adopted by parliament last week , offers a pardon for kurdish rebels who lay down their arms and surrender and who have not committed any violent crimes .
it also envisages reducing the jail sentences of those already imprisoned for violent acts , if they provide the authorities with information about their underground activities .
the amnesty , mainly aimed at rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- - now renamed kadek - will be valid for six months .
the kurdish rebels have fought a bloody separatist war in the country ’ s mainly kurdish south-east since 1984 , claiming the lives of more than 36,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan .
though kadek announced a cease-fire in 1999 following the capture of leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- , some 5,000 rebels are believed to be still holed up in mountainous bases in northern iraq .
ankara believes that around 2,000 rebels can qualify for the amnesty .
however , senior leaders and commanders of kadek have been excluded from it .
the amnesty is seen by some observers as an attempt by turkey to improve on its woeful record of human-rights record . of particular concern for the eu has been the rampant use of torture in prisons and police stations .
weakening the grip of the mighty military the amnesty law comes close on the heels of another landmark package of reforms passed by the turkish parliament last week . the new laws drastically curtail the power of the country ’ s powerful army generals , the self-proclaimed guardians of turkey ’ s secular constitution and long considered a potent force in turkish politics .
the measures aim to curb the political influence of the military , strips the military-dominated national security council -lrb- mgk -rrb- of its executive powers and turns it into a advisory body .
it also abolishes some anti-terror laws thought to crush freedom of thought and expression .
" this law is a step for democracy and freedom .
our aim is to reach the standards of countries already enjoying first class rights and freedoms , " turkish justice minister cemil cicek told parliament after the vote .
on monday , turkey 's military proved they would allow the reforms when they appointed an army general as secretary-general of the mgk , a move observors say will sharply reduce the power of the general as compared to his predecessors .
" the fact that a four-star general will be heading the secretariat does n't really mean that the military will be as instrumental as they were in the past .
the functions are no longer there , " sedat ergin , ankara bureau chief for turkey 's daily hurriyet told reuters .
all for the sake of eu membership the latest measures are all part of turkey ’ s attempt to convince brussels of its commitment to a reformist agenda and fall into the seventh of a series of so-called " harmonization packages " that would bring turkey into line with its would-be eu partners and eventually qualify it for membership of the european union .
brussels says it will not hold accession talks with turkey - the only eu candidate country with a predominantly muslim population - unless it first implements a wide-ranging series of measures that would meet eu criteria setting standards for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which every eu candidate must fulfill .
for ankara , this means nothing short of revamping its much of system of governance , which is considered riddled by corruption , poor on human rights and largely controlled by the fiercely secular army generals who are wary of both muslim fundamentalism and kurdish separatism .
road to eu club remains rocky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan though previous governments began tackling the formidable task by pushing through past eu harmonization bills , the present ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- has stepped up the pace of reforms by bolstering rights and freedoms for the country ’ s estimated 12 million-strong kurdish minority .
however major challenges remain in the form of an uneasy relationship between the powerful military and the akp .
the secular-minded army generals - who forced an islamist government out of office in 1997 - remain suspicious of the akp ’ s islamist roots , though its leaders have disavowed them and have promised to support democratic reform and keep religion out of politics .
the generals are also jittery that the emergence of a kurdish quasi-state next door in iraq might stir aspirations among turkey ’ s kurdish minority population of greater freedom and might be reinforced by the eu ’ s insistence on minority rights .
turkey ’ s goal of eu membership remains further complicated , this time by a debate outside its borders , with some eu officials saying turkey with its predominantly muslim population should not become a member because its cultural identity and history are not european enough .
for now however the eu has welcomed turkey ’ s latest measures to help smooth its path into the club .
cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , told reuters , " our reaction is very positive .
of course we all want to look at the small print and the implementation , but this goes exactly in the direction of fulfilling the copenhagen criteria . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey takes the cultural route to the eu turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations .

germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly . the on-going saga that is germany ’ s can and bottle deposit system took another embarrassing turn on wednesday when the president of the european commission , romano prodi , reportedly called on gerhard schröder ’ s government to sort out the messy situation . an article published in the mass circulation tabloid bild reported that prodi had issued an ultimatum to the german chancellor to bring the chaos to an end .
in a letter to schröder , prodi threatened germany with a “ contractual violation procedure ” should the planned october 1 launch of the permanent network of deposit machines not come into existence .
the ec president also demanded that the current compulsory deposit on single-use packaging be suspended until the final system is up and running . a government spokesman on wednesday said the letter bild referred to was had been sent to berlin last month .
" we 're on the same page as brussels , " said the spokesman .
" an extension of the temporary rules is out of the question . " it is not the first time the ec has spoken out about the situation in germany regarding the deposit system but the severity of the tone and the personal intervention of romano prodi take the disagreement to a more serious level . ec claimed system unfair to foreign businesses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frederik -lrb- frits -rrb- bolkestein .
in july , the european commission claimed that the interim arrangement for handling the deposit , which came into force at the start of the year , could conflict with eu laws on free movement of goods .

germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly . the on-going saga that is germany ’ s can and bottle deposit system took another embarrassing turn on wednesday when the president of the european commission , romano prodi , reportedly called on gerhard schröder ’ s government to sort out the messy situation . an article published in the mass circulation tabloid bild reported that prodi had issued an ultimatum to the german chancellor to bring the chaos to an end .
in a letter to schröder , prodi threatened germany with a “ contractual violation procedure ” should the planned october 1 launch of the permanent network of deposit machines not come into existence .
the ec president also demanded that the current compulsory deposit on single-use packaging be suspended until the final system is up and running . a government spokesman on wednesday said the letter bild referred to was had been sent to berlin last month .
" we 're on the same page as brussels , " said the spokesman .
" an extension of the temporary rules is out of the question . " it is not the first time the ec has spoken out about the situation in germany regarding the deposit system but the severity of the tone and the personal intervention of romano prodi take the disagreement to a more serious level . ec claimed system unfair to foreign businesses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frederik -lrb- frits -rrb- bolkestein .
in july , the european commission claimed that the interim arrangement for handling the deposit , which came into force at the start of the year , could conflict with eu laws on free movement of goods .
claiming that the system had drastically reduced sales of beverages in recyclable containers , ec internal market commissioner frits bolkestein said at the time that he believed the present system in germany put foreign filling companies at a disadvantage .
germany ’ s environment ministry spokesman michael schrören defended the system in a statement : “ there are no signs that imported products are disadvantaged by the current interim deposit rule .
on the contrary , 15 percent more foreign mineral water than before has been sold since the introduction of the deposit . ”
german environment minister jürgen trittin also sent a letter to the ec asking for proof that french mineral water suppliers had seen lower export sales due to the deposit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin however , despite the exchange of words , trittin told the german news agency dpa soon after : “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission . ” the eu threatened to take legal action against germany as recently as last month but then changed its mind , demanding only that the system due to be introduced in october be replaced by an eu approved alternative . plagued with problems at home on a national level , the nationwide interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has been plagued by problems since its introduction in january but none has been more damaging than the german beverage industry ’ s decision to suspend the expensive operation in july .
the industry claimed that there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the investment of billions of euros , which caused an angry response from trittin who told the industry that it must stand by its promise to adhere to the recycling law . speaking at the time of the decision , peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , said in a statement , “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs .
we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” plan to simplify recycling backfires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good idea badly managed ?
the deposit system or “ dosenpfand ” was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers by charging consumers a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles , encouraging them to return the empties to the place of purchase in order to get their money back . government hopes that the system would increase recycling have been dashed by complaints from the business community and consumers who say the scheme is inconvenient and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the interim deposit system was expected to be replaced on october 1 by the permanent network of collection machines .
however , the environment ministry will have to restart negotiations with the beverage industry in an attempt to resurrect the system if it is not to incur more wrath from the european commission and possible legal action . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beverage industry balks at can deposit in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers .

haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .

" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .

the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .
the attempted hijacking of the deal fell through when apax 's partner , the carlyle group , dropped out leaving the road clear for saban .

german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.08.2003 makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former thorn in the side becomes a rose in the bayern garden bayern munich pulled out all the stops to secure the signing of dutch international striker roy makaay in an attempt to mount a more serious assault on the european champions league this season . it ’ s a well known fact that german soccer clubs have been experiencing financial woes in the wake of the television rights crisis that has plagued the bundesliga for the past two seasons .
as if to emphasis the point further , the summer transfer market in germany was relatively quiet with the big clubs seemingly satisfied with their current squads as the season came closer to kick off .
even the champions were spending thriftily on the eve of their title defense .
that is until this week when bayern munich revealed on monday that dutch striker roy makaay would be joining them from deportivo la coruna in spain for an undisclosed sum .
the fee is rumored to be somewhere between deportivo ’ s estimated € 20 million -lrb- $ 22.61million -rrb- price tag and bayern ’ s offer of € 16 million , with some voices whispering that it could be the second most expensive in the league ’ s 40-year history .
the 28-year-old could start repaying that financial layout when he makes his debut in the bundesliga game at hanover 96 on saturday , august 9 .
euro hopes boosted by arrival makaay , who won the golden boot award for europe 's top scorer last season , after netting 29 goals in 38 league matches for deportivo , joins the bavarian giants in a four-year deal as they prepare to defend their standing as number one in the bundesliga and steel themselves for another assault on the european champions league .
after the disappointment of last season ’ s short-lived european adventure , makaay ’ s arrival is expected to strengthen the team as bayern goes up against the likes of real madrid , juventus turin and manchester united .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern will be hoping for a better european challenge this year .
the irony will not be lost on the many bayern fans who have enthusiastically welcomed makaay to the club .
makaay was instrumental in setting the wreaking ball in motion on bayern ’ s ill-fated and disastrous foray into last season ’ s champions league campaign .
as the main danger man for deportivo , makaay scored three times in the olympic stadium as bayern opened their campaign with a 3-2 defeat to the primera league team and consequently failed in their attempt to reach the second phase of the competition .
deal completed in nick of time makaay will now be eligible for bayern ’ s champions league games as the deal went through before deportivo played in the third qualifying round of the tournament which takes place on august 13 .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said earlier in the week that if deportivo registered makaay for the champions league , the transfer would have been called off ; such is the club ’ s desire to build their european campaign around him .
makaay ’ s arrival will also spark a competition for places in the team as the current first choice striking duo is made up of giovanni elber and claudio pizzaro .
but as the club 's supervisory board chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday , " i am certain that we need a third top striker alongside elber and pizarro for a long season . "
beckenbauer wields his influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer rates makaay highly .
beckenbauer was personally involved in persuading commercial manager uli hoeness to pursue makaay , saying during the transfer negotiations that the club should meet deportivo ’ s conditions if they wanted to capture the dutchman ’ s signature .
" such a player would be an enrichment for bayern and the entire bundesliga .
whether we have to pay a million more is not important . "
it ’ s no surprise that makaay is such a coveted player .
the dutchman started his career at vitesse arnhem in his native country where he scored 11 goals in his first full season during the 1995/96 campaign .
he almost doubled that tally in his last season in holland before moving to tenerife where he managed only 21 goals in his two years with the club .
things really took off when makaay joined deportivo in 1999 .
accustomed to honors as well as scoring 79 league goals in four seasons with the club and nine times in last season 's champions league , makaay also won the liga title and the spanish super cup in 2000 and the spanish copa del rey and a second super cup in 2002 .
bayern will be hoping that makaay ’ s expertise will help them to secure more honors at home and abroad . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de another easy bundesliga title for bayern ?

haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .
the long protective market will now experience measured influence from foreign investors via saban .
" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .
" we look forward to completing the transaction . "
his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .
but it wo n't likely be reflected when prosieben ceo urs rohner releases the figures for the first half of the year this thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haim saban backed by private equity firms , saban 's offer of € 7.50 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per share for the 72 percent of unlisted but vote-wielding ordinary stock was accepted just two months after his first attempt failed .
the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .

germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly . the on-going saga that is germany ’ s can and bottle deposit system took another embarrassing turn on wednesday when the president of the european commission , romano prodi , reportedly called on gerhard schröder ’ s government to sort out the messy situation . an article published in the mass circulation tabloid bild reported that prodi had issued an ultimatum to the german chancellor to bring the chaos to an end .
in a letter to schröder , prodi threatened germany with a “ contractual violation procedure ” should the planned october 1 launch of the permanent network of deposit machines not come into existence .
the ec president also demanded that the current compulsory deposit on single-use packaging be suspended until the final system is up and running . a government spokesman on wednesday said the letter bild referred to was had been sent to berlin last month .
" we 're on the same page as brussels , " said the spokesman .
" an extension of the temporary rules is out of the question .

the industry claimed that there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the investment of billions of euros , which caused an angry response from trittin who told the industry that it must stand by its promise to adhere to the recycling law . speaking at the time of the decision , peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , said in a statement , “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs .

germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly . the on-going saga that is germany ’ s can and bottle deposit system took another embarrassing turn on wednesday when the president of the european commission , romano prodi , reportedly called on gerhard schröder ’ s government to sort out the messy situation . an article published in the mass circulation tabloid bild reported that prodi had issued an ultimatum to the german chancellor to bring the chaos to an end .
in a letter to schröder , prodi threatened germany with a “ contractual violation procedure ” should the planned october 1 launch of the permanent network of deposit machines not come into existence .
the ec president also demanded that the current compulsory deposit on single-use packaging be suspended until the final system is up and running . a government spokesman on wednesday said the letter bild referred to was had been sent to berlin last month .

in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership . turkish president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday approved an amnesty law for kurdish rebels once engaged in a vicious war in the south-east of the country .
the law , adopted by parliament last week , offers a pardon for kurdish rebels who lay down their arms and surrender and who have not committed any violent crimes .
it also envisages reducing the jail sentences of those already imprisoned for violent acts , if they provide the authorities with information about their underground activities .
the amnesty , mainly aimed at rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- - now renamed kadek - will be valid for six months .
the kurdish rebels have fought a bloody separatist war in the country ’ s mainly kurdish south-east since 1984 , claiming the lives of more than 36,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan .
though kadek announced a cease-fire in 1999 following the capture of leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- , some 5,000 rebels are believed to be still holed up in mountainous bases in northern iraq .
ankara believes that around 2,000 rebels can qualify for the amnesty .
however , senior leaders and commanders of kadek have been excluded from it .
the amnesty is seen by some observers as an attempt by turkey to improve on its woeful record of human-rights record . of particular concern for the eu has been the rampant use of torture in prisons and police stations .
weakening the grip of the mighty military the amnesty law comes close on the heels of another landmark package of reforms passed by the turkish parliament last week . the new laws drastically curtail the power of the country ’ s powerful army generals , the self-proclaimed guardians of turkey ’ s secular constitution and long considered a potent force in turkish politics .
the measures aim to curb the political influence of the military , strips the military-dominated national security council -lrb- mgk -rrb- of its executive powers and turns it into a advisory body .
it also abolishes some anti-terror laws thought to crush freedom of thought and expression .
" this law is a step for democracy and freedom .
our aim is to reach the standards of countries already enjoying first class rights and freedoms , " turkish justice minister cemil cicek told parliament after the vote .
on monday , turkey 's military proved they would allow the reforms when they appointed an army general as secretary-general of the mgk , a move observors say will sharply reduce the power of the general as compared to his predecessors .
" the fact that a four-star general will be heading the secretariat does n't really mean that the military will be as instrumental as they were in the past .
the functions are no longer there , " sedat ergin , ankara bureau chief for turkey 's daily hurriyet told reuters .
all for the sake of eu membership the latest measures are all part of turkey ’ s attempt to convince brussels of its commitment to a reformist agenda and fall into the seventh of a series of so-called " harmonization packages " that would bring turkey into line with its would-be eu partners and eventually qualify it for membership of the european union .
brussels says it will not hold accession talks with turkey - the only eu candidate country with a predominantly muslim population - unless it first implements a wide-ranging series of measures that would meet eu criteria setting standards for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which every eu candidate must fulfill .
for ankara , this means nothing short of revamping its much of system of governance , which is considered riddled by corruption , poor on human rights and largely controlled by the fiercely secular army generals who are wary of both muslim fundamentalism and kurdish separatism .
road to eu club remains rocky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan though previous governments began tackling the formidable task by pushing through past eu harmonization bills , the present ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- has stepped up the pace of reforms by bolstering rights and freedoms for the country ’ s estimated 12 million-strong kurdish minority .
however major challenges remain in the form of an uneasy relationship between the powerful military and the akp .
the secular-minded army generals - who forced an islamist government out of office in 1997 - remain suspicious of the akp ’ s islamist roots , though its leaders have disavowed them and have promised to support democratic reform and keep religion out of politics .
the generals are also jittery that the emergence of a kurdish quasi-state next door in iraq might stir aspirations among turkey ’ s kurdish minority population of greater freedom and might be reinforced by the eu ’ s insistence on minority rights .
turkey ’ s goal of eu membership remains further complicated , this time by a debate outside its borders , with some eu officials saying turkey with its predominantly muslim population should not become a member because its cultural identity and history are not european enough .
for now however the eu has welcomed turkey ’ s latest measures to help smooth its path into the club .
cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , told reuters , " our reaction is very positive .
of course we all want to look at the small print and the implementation , but this goes exactly in the direction of fulfilling the copenhagen criteria .

in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture . "
a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?
and how can they handle this enormous task at a time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs ?
are these issues better tackled through traditional or digital means ?
the prevailing consensus at the congress : neither the pixel nor the printed word will prevail , but the problems are best solved by a mixture of both .
" the library of the future will be a hybrid , " says library director georg ruppelt .
" the hybrid library allows electronic access to everything possible , but printed books will remain . "
thus , digital and analog will coexist peacefully side-by-side .
mirroring this statement , jürgen seefeldt and ludger syre submitted a paper describing the library of 2015 .
according to them , the initial experience with digital technology has failed to entirely displace the book and that will continue to be the case .
it seems that no one really wants to read earnestly for long periods of time in an electronic library .
a strategic alliance librarians hope to maximize the advantages of both traditional books and technology in a strategic alliance .
instead of an unwieldy card catalog , they foresee efficient networked databases , with access to the reserves of libraries around the world .
yet the old-school stacks will remain , including the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book " and all the other tactile elements .
ideally , both will be stored in an aesthetically pleasing space - a library that can serve as a social meeting place .
so , at the world library and information congress at least , the battle between the printed word and the pixel has been resolved through a peaceful co-existence , with each medium retained to suit its ideal purpose .
traditional bibliophiles can keep their books and techno-fans can have their pixels .
and maybe that 's the way it will go in the consumer market .
even john updike has licensed his upcoming book for digital distribution , a nod to those who would rather read on their lap-top . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de acid to acid , dust to dust in the labyrinth-like archives of the country 's libraries , millions of books are slowly crumbling to dust .

in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership . turkish president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday approved an amnesty law for kurdish rebels once engaged in a vicious war in the south-east of the country .
the law , adopted by parliament last week , offers a pardon for kurdish rebels who lay down their arms and surrender and who have not committed any violent crimes .
it also envisages reducing the jail sentences of those already imprisoned for violent acts , if they provide the authorities with information about their underground activities .
the amnesty , mainly aimed at rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- - now renamed kadek - will be valid for six months .
the kurdish rebels have fought a bloody separatist war in the country ’ s mainly kurdish south-east since 1984 , claiming the lives of more than 36,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan .
though kadek announced a cease-fire in 1999 following the capture of leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- , some 5,000 rebels are believed to be still holed up in mountainous bases in northern iraq .
ankara believes that around 2,000 rebels can qualify for the amnesty .
however , senior leaders and commanders of kadek have been excluded from it .
the amnesty is seen by some observers as an attempt by turkey to improve on its woeful record of human-rights record . of particular concern for the eu has been the rampant use of torture in prisons and police stations .
weakening the grip of the mighty military the amnesty law comes close on the heels of another landmark package of reforms passed by the turkish parliament last week . the new laws drastically curtail the power of the country ’ s powerful army generals , the self-proclaimed guardians of turkey ’ s secular constitution and long considered a potent force in turkish politics .
the measures aim to curb the political influence of the military , strips the military-dominated national security council -lrb- mgk -rrb- of its executive powers and turns it into a advisory body .
it also abolishes some anti-terror laws thought to crush freedom of thought and expression .
" this law is a step for democracy and freedom .
our aim is to reach the standards of countries already enjoying first class rights and freedoms , " turkish justice minister cemil cicek told parliament after the vote .
on monday , turkey 's military proved they would allow the reforms when they appointed an army general as secretary-general of the mgk , a move observors say will sharply reduce the power of the general as compared to his predecessors .
" the fact that a four-star general will be heading the secretariat does n't really mean that the military will be as instrumental as they were in the past .
the functions are no longer there , " sedat ergin , ankara bureau chief for turkey 's daily hurriyet told reuters .
all for the sake of eu membership the latest measures are all part of turkey ’ s attempt to convince brussels of its commitment to a reformist agenda and fall into the seventh of a series of so-called " harmonization packages " that would bring turkey into line with its would-be eu partners and eventually qualify it for membership of the european union .
brussels says it will not hold accession talks with turkey - the only eu candidate country with a predominantly muslim population - unless it first implements a wide-ranging series of measures that would meet eu criteria setting standards for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which every eu candidate must fulfill .
for ankara , this means nothing short of revamping its much of system of governance , which is considered riddled by corruption , poor on human rights and largely controlled by the fiercely secular army generals who are wary of both muslim fundamentalism and kurdish separatism .
road to eu club remains rocky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan though previous governments began tackling the formidable task by pushing through past eu harmonization bills , the present ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- has stepped up the pace of reforms by bolstering rights and freedoms for the country ’ s estimated 12 million-strong kurdish minority .
however major challenges remain in the form of an uneasy relationship between the powerful military and the akp .
the secular-minded army generals - who forced an islamist government out of office in 1997 - remain suspicious of the akp ’ s islamist roots , though its leaders have disavowed them and have promised to support democratic reform and keep religion out of politics .
the generals are also jittery that the emergence of a kurdish quasi-state next door in iraq might stir aspirations among turkey ’ s kurdish minority population of greater freedom and might be reinforced by the eu ’ s insistence on minority rights .
turkey ’ s goal of eu membership remains further complicated , this time by a debate outside its borders , with some eu officials saying turkey with its predominantly muslim population should not become a member because its cultural identity and history are not european enough .
for now however the eu has welcomed turkey ’ s latest measures to help smooth its path into the club .
cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , told reuters , " our reaction is very positive .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.08.2003 makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former thorn in the side becomes a rose in the bayern garden bayern munich pulled out all the stops to secure the signing of dutch international striker roy makaay in an attempt to mount a more serious assault on the european champions league this season . it ’ s a well known fact that german soccer clubs have been experiencing financial woes in the wake of the television rights crisis that has plagued the bundesliga for the past two seasons .
as if to emphasis the point further , the summer transfer market in germany was relatively quiet with the big clubs seemingly satisfied with their current squads as the season came closer to kick off .
even the champions were spending thriftily on the eve of their title defense .
that is until this week when bayern munich revealed on monday that dutch striker roy makaay would be joining them from deportivo la coruna in spain for an undisclosed sum .
the fee is rumored to be somewhere between deportivo ’ s estimated € 20 million -lrb- $ 22.61million -rrb- price tag and bayern ’ s offer of € 16 million , with some voices whispering that it could be the second most expensive in the league ’ s 40-year history .
the 28-year-old could start repaying that financial layout when he makes his debut in the bundesliga game at hanover 96 on saturday , august 9 .
euro hopes boosted by arrival makaay , who won the golden boot award for europe 's top scorer last season , after netting 29 goals in 38 league matches for deportivo , joins the bavarian giants in a four-year deal as they prepare to defend their standing as number one in the bundesliga and steel themselves for another assault on the european champions league .
after the disappointment of last season ’ s short-lived european adventure , makaay ’ s arrival is expected to strengthen the team as bayern goes up against the likes of real madrid , juventus turin and manchester united .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern will be hoping for a better european challenge this year .
the irony will not be lost on the many bayern fans who have enthusiastically welcomed makaay to the club .
makaay was instrumental in setting the wreaking ball in motion on bayern ’ s ill-fated and disastrous foray into last season ’ s champions league campaign .
as the main danger man for deportivo , makaay scored three times in the olympic stadium as bayern opened their campaign with a 3-2 defeat to the primera league team and consequently failed in their attempt to reach the second phase of the competition .
deal completed in nick of time makaay will now be eligible for bayern ’ s champions league games as the deal went through before deportivo played in the third qualifying round of the tournament which takes place on august 13 .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said earlier in the week that if deportivo registered makaay for the champions league , the transfer would have been called off ; such is the club ’ s desire to build their european campaign around him .
makaay ’ s arrival will also spark a competition for places in the team as the current first choice striking duo is made up of giovanni elber and claudio pizzaro .
but as the club 's supervisory board chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday , " i am certain that we need a third top striker alongside elber and pizarro for a long season . "
beckenbauer wields his influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer rates makaay highly .
beckenbauer was personally involved in persuading commercial manager uli hoeness to pursue makaay , saying during the transfer negotiations that the club should meet deportivo ’ s conditions if they wanted to capture the dutchman ’ s signature .
" such a player would be an enrichment for bayern and the entire bundesliga .
whether we have to pay a million more is not important . "
it ’ s no surprise that makaay is such a coveted player .
the dutchman started his career at vitesse arnhem in his native country where he scored 11 goals in his first full season during the 1995/96 campaign .
he almost doubled that tally in his last season in holland before moving to tenerife where he managed only 21 goals in his two years with the club .
things really took off when makaay joined deportivo in 1999 .
accustomed to honors as well as scoring 79 league goals in four seasons with the club and nine times in last season 's champions league , makaay also won the liga title and the spanish super cup in 2000 and the spanish copa del rey and a second super cup in 2002 .

in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture . "
a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?
and how can they handle this enormous task at a time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs ?
are these issues better tackled through traditional or digital means ?
the prevailing consensus at the congress : neither the pixel nor the printed word will prevail , but the problems are best solved by a mixture of both .
" the library of the future will be a hybrid , " says library director georg ruppelt .
" the hybrid library allows electronic access to everything possible , but printed books will remain . "
thus , digital and analog will coexist peacefully side-by-side .
mirroring this statement , jürgen seefeldt and ludger syre submitted a paper describing the library of 2015 .
according to them , the initial experience with digital technology has failed to entirely displace the book and that will continue to be the case .
it seems that no one really wants to read earnestly for long periods of time in an electronic library .
a strategic alliance librarians hope to maximize the advantages of both traditional books and technology in a strategic alliance .
instead of an unwieldy card catalog , they foresee efficient networked databases , with access to the reserves of libraries around the world .
yet the old-school stacks will remain , including the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book " and all the other tactile elements .
ideally , both will be stored in an aesthetically pleasing space - a library that can serve as a social meeting place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.08.2003 turkey pushes forward on eu reform course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demands for change are growing , especially among turkey 's kurdish minority .
in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership . turkish president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday approved an amnesty law for kurdish rebels once engaged in a vicious war in the south-east of the country .
the law , adopted by parliament last week , offers a pardon for kurdish rebels who lay down their arms and surrender and who have not committed any violent crimes .
it also envisages reducing the jail sentences of those already imprisoned for violent acts , if they provide the authorities with information about their underground activities .
the amnesty , mainly aimed at rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- - now renamed kadek - will be valid for six months .
the kurdish rebels have fought a bloody separatist war in the country ’ s mainly kurdish south-east since 1984 , claiming the lives of more than 36,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan .
though kadek announced a cease-fire in 1999 following the capture of leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- , some 5,000 rebels are believed to be still holed up in mountainous bases in northern iraq .
ankara believes that around 2,000 rebels can qualify for the amnesty .
however , senior leaders and commanders of kadek have been excluded from it .
the amnesty is seen by some observers as an attempt by turkey to improve on its woeful record of human-rights record . of particular concern for the eu has been the rampant use of torture in prisons and police stations .
weakening the grip of the mighty military the amnesty law comes close on the heels of another landmark package of reforms passed by the turkish parliament last week . the new laws drastically curtail the power of the country ’ s powerful army generals , the self-proclaimed guardians of turkey ’ s secular constitution and long considered a potent force in turkish politics .
the measures aim to curb the political influence of the military , strips the military-dominated national security council -lrb- mgk -rrb- of its executive powers and turns it into a advisory body .
it also abolishes some anti-terror laws thought to crush freedom of thought and expression .
" this law is a step for democracy and freedom .
our aim is to reach the standards of countries already enjoying first class rights and freedoms , " turkish justice minister cemil cicek told parliament after the vote .
on monday , turkey 's military proved they would allow the reforms when they appointed an army general as secretary-general of the mgk , a move observors say will sharply reduce the power of the general as compared to his predecessors .
" the fact that a four-star general will be heading the secretariat does n't really mean that the military will be as instrumental as they were in the past .
the functions are no longer there , " sedat ergin , ankara bureau chief for turkey 's daily hurriyet told reuters .
all for the sake of eu membership the latest measures are all part of turkey ’ s attempt to convince brussels of its commitment to a reformist agenda and fall into the seventh of a series of so-called " harmonization packages " that would bring turkey into line with its would-be eu partners and eventually qualify it for membership of the european union .
brussels says it will not hold accession talks with turkey - the only eu candidate country with a predominantly muslim population - unless it first implements a wide-ranging series of measures that would meet eu criteria setting standards for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which every eu candidate must fulfill .
for ankara , this means nothing short of revamping its much of system of governance , which is considered riddled by corruption , poor on human rights and largely controlled by the fiercely secular army generals who are wary of both muslim fundamentalism and kurdish separatism .
road to eu club remains rocky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan though previous governments began tackling the formidable task by pushing through past eu harmonization bills , the present ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- has stepped up the pace of reforms by bolstering rights and freedoms for the country ’ s estimated 12 million-strong kurdish minority .
however major challenges remain in the form of an uneasy relationship between the powerful military and the akp .
the secular-minded army generals - who forced an islamist government out of office in 1997 - remain suspicious of the akp ’ s islamist roots , though its leaders have disavowed them and have promised to support democratic reform and keep religion out of politics .
the generals are also jittery that the emergence of a kurdish quasi-state next door in iraq might stir aspirations among turkey ’ s kurdish minority population of greater freedom and might be reinforced by the eu ’ s insistence on minority rights .
turkey ’ s goal of eu membership remains further complicated , this time by a debate outside its borders , with some eu officials saying turkey with its predominantly muslim population should not become a member because its cultural identity and history are not european enough .
for now however the eu has welcomed turkey ’ s latest measures to help smooth its path into the club .
cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , told reuters , " our reaction is very positive .
of course we all want to look at the small print and the implementation , but this goes exactly in the direction of fulfilling the copenhagen criteria . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey takes the cultural route to the eu turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations .

haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .
the long protective market will now experience measured influence from foreign investors via saban .
" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .
" we look forward to completing the transaction . "
his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .
but it wo n't likely be reflected when prosieben ceo urs rohner releases the figures for the first half of the year this thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haim saban backed by private equity firms , saban 's offer of € 7.50 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per share for the 72 percent of unlisted but vote-wielding ordinary stock was accepted just two months after his first attempt failed .
the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .
the attempted hijacking of the deal fell through when apax 's partner , the carlyle group , dropped out leaving the road clear for saban .
" the vote -lrb- for saban 's bid -rrb- was unanimous , " said a spokesman for kirchmedia .
kirch 's crown jewel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch the creditors in charge of the bankrupt company 's crown jewel have been trying to sell prosiebensat.1 for over a year .
during that time , they attempted to offload the group a number of times in a bid to recover some of the billions of euros they had lent leo kirch , turning the on-going saga surrounding the bidding war into a turbulent auction .
german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .
but saban had other ideas and bauer was elbowed aside , leaving the american to sign a deal in march .
however , that attempt failed in june after saban had problems with financing .
his determination to get into the german market , however , never waivered .

germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly . the on-going saga that is germany ’ s can and bottle deposit system took another embarrassing turn on wednesday when the president of the european commission , romano prodi , reportedly called on gerhard schröder ’ s government to sort out the messy situation . an article published in the mass circulation tabloid bild reported that prodi had issued an ultimatum to the german chancellor to bring the chaos to an end .
in a letter to schröder , prodi threatened germany with a “ contractual violation procedure ” should the planned october 1 launch of the permanent network of deposit machines not come into existence .
the ec president also demanded that the current compulsory deposit on single-use packaging be suspended until the final system is up and running . a government spokesman on wednesday said the letter bild referred to was had been sent to berlin last month .
" we 're on the same page as brussels , " said the spokesman .
" an extension of the temporary rules is out of the question . " it is not the first time the ec has spoken out about the situation in germany regarding the deposit system but the severity of the tone and the personal intervention of romano prodi take the disagreement to a more serious level . ec claimed system unfair to foreign businesses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frederik -lrb- frits -rrb- bolkestein .
in july , the european commission claimed that the interim arrangement for handling the deposit , which came into force at the start of the year , could conflict with eu laws on free movement of goods .
claiming that the system had drastically reduced sales of beverages in recyclable containers , ec internal market commissioner frits bolkestein said at the time that he believed the present system in germany put foreign filling companies at a disadvantage .
germany ’ s environment ministry spokesman michael schrören defended the system in a statement : “ there are no signs that imported products are disadvantaged by the current interim deposit rule .
on the contrary , 15 percent more foreign mineral water than before has been sold since the introduction of the deposit . ”
german environment minister jürgen trittin also sent a letter to the ec asking for proof that french mineral water suppliers had seen lower export sales due to the deposit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin however , despite the exchange of words , trittin told the german news agency dpa soon after : “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission . ” the eu threatened to take legal action against germany as recently as last month but then changed its mind , demanding only that the system due to be introduced in october be replaced by an eu approved alternative . plagued with problems at home on a national level , the nationwide interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has been plagued by problems since its introduction in january but none has been more damaging than the german beverage industry ’ s decision to suspend the expensive operation in july .
the industry claimed that there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the investment of billions of euros , which caused an angry response from trittin who told the industry that it must stand by its promise to adhere to the recycling law . speaking at the time of the decision , peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , said in a statement , “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs .
we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” plan to simplify recycling backfires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good idea badly managed ?
the deposit system or “ dosenpfand ” was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers by charging consumers a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles , encouraging them to return the empties to the place of purchase in order to get their money back . government hopes that the system would increase recycling have been dashed by complaints from the business community and consumers who say the scheme is inconvenient and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the interim deposit system was expected to be replaced on october 1 by the permanent network of collection machines .
however , the environment ministry will have to restart negotiations with the beverage industry in an attempt to resurrect the system if it is not to incur more wrath from the european commission and possible legal action . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beverage industry balks at can deposit in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers .

haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .
the long protective market will now experience measured influence from foreign investors via saban .
" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .
" we look forward to completing the transaction . "
his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .

the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .
the attempted hijacking of the deal fell through when apax 's partner , the carlyle group , dropped out leaving the road clear for saban .
" the vote -lrb- for saban 's bid -rrb- was unanimous , " said a spokesman for kirchmedia .
kirch 's crown jewel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch the creditors in charge of the bankrupt company 's crown jewel have been trying to sell prosiebensat.1 for over a year .
during that time , they attempted to offload the group a number of times in a bid to recover some of the billions of euros they had lent leo kirch , turning the on-going saga surrounding the bidding war into a turbulent auction .
german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .
but saban had other ideas and bauer was elbowed aside , leaving the american to sign a deal in march .
however , that attempt failed in june after saban had problems with financing .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.08.2003 makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former thorn in the side becomes a rose in the bayern garden bayern munich pulled out all the stops to secure the signing of dutch international striker roy makaay in an attempt to mount a more serious assault on the european champions league this season . it ’ s a well known fact that german soccer clubs have been experiencing financial woes in the wake of the television rights crisis that has plagued the bundesliga for the past two seasons .
as if to emphasis the point further , the summer transfer market in germany was relatively quiet with the big clubs seemingly satisfied with their current squads as the season came closer to kick off .
even the champions were spending thriftily on the eve of their title defense .
that is until this week when bayern munich revealed on monday that dutch striker roy makaay would be joining them from deportivo la coruna in spain for an undisclosed sum .
the fee is rumored to be somewhere between deportivo ’ s estimated € 20 million -lrb- $ 22.61million -rrb- price tag and bayern ’ s offer of € 16 million , with some voices whispering that it could be the second most expensive in the league ’ s 40-year history .
the 28-year-old could start repaying that financial layout when he makes his debut in the bundesliga game at hanover 96 on saturday , august 9 .
euro hopes boosted by arrival makaay , who won the golden boot award for europe 's top scorer last season , after netting 29 goals in 38 league matches for deportivo , joins the bavarian giants in a four-year deal as they prepare to defend their standing as number one in the bundesliga and steel themselves for another assault on the european champions league .
after the disappointment of last season ’ s short-lived european adventure , makaay ’ s arrival is expected to strengthen the team as bayern goes up against the likes of real madrid , juventus turin and manchester united .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern will be hoping for a better european challenge this year .
the irony will not be lost on the many bayern fans who have enthusiastically welcomed makaay to the club .
makaay was instrumental in setting the wreaking ball in motion on bayern ’ s ill-fated and disastrous foray into last season ’ s champions league campaign .
as the main danger man for deportivo , makaay scored three times in the olympic stadium as bayern opened their campaign with a 3-2 defeat to the primera league team and consequently failed in their attempt to reach the second phase of the competition .
deal completed in nick of time makaay will now be eligible for bayern ’ s champions league games as the deal went through before deportivo played in the third qualifying round of the tournament which takes place on august 13 .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said earlier in the week that if deportivo registered makaay for the champions league , the transfer would have been called off ; such is the club ’ s desire to build their european campaign around him .
makaay ’ s arrival will also spark a competition for places in the team as the current first choice striking duo is made up of giovanni elber and claudio pizzaro .
but as the club 's supervisory board chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday , " i am certain that we need a third top striker alongside elber and pizarro for a long season . "
beckenbauer wields his influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer rates makaay highly .
beckenbauer was personally involved in persuading commercial manager uli hoeness to pursue makaay , saying during the transfer negotiations that the club should meet deportivo ’ s conditions if they wanted to capture the dutchman ’ s signature .
" such a player would be an enrichment for bayern and the entire bundesliga .
whether we have to pay a million more is not important . "
it ’ s no surprise that makaay is such a coveted player .
the dutchman started his career at vitesse arnhem in his native country where he scored 11 goals in his first full season during the 1995/96 campaign .
he almost doubled that tally in his last season in holland before moving to tenerife where he managed only 21 goals in his two years with the club .
things really took off when makaay joined deportivo in 1999 .
accustomed to honors as well as scoring 79 league goals in four seasons with the club and nine times in last season 's champions league , makaay also won the liga title and the spanish super cup in 2000 and the spanish copa del rey and a second super cup in 2002 .

the fee is rumored to be somewhere between deportivo ’ s estimated € 20 million -lrb- $ 22.61million -rrb- price tag and bayern ’ s offer of € 16 million , with some voices whispering that it could be the second most expensive in the league ’ s 40-year history .
the 28-year-old could start repaying that financial layout when he makes his debut in the bundesliga game at hanover 96 on saturday , august 9 .
euro hopes boosted by arrival makaay , who won the golden boot award for europe 's top scorer last season , after netting 29 goals in 38 league matches for deportivo , joins the bavarian giants in a four-year deal as they prepare to defend their standing as number one in the bundesliga and steel themselves for another assault on the european champions league .
after the disappointment of last season ’ s short-lived european adventure , makaay ’ s arrival is expected to strengthen the team as bayern goes up against the likes of real madrid , juventus turin and manchester united .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern will be hoping for a better european challenge this year .
the irony will not be lost on the many bayern fans who have enthusiastically welcomed makaay to the club .
makaay was instrumental in setting the wreaking ball in motion on bayern ’ s ill-fated and disastrous foray into last season ’ s champions league campaign .
as the main danger man for deportivo , makaay scored three times in the olympic stadium as bayern opened their campaign with a 3-2 defeat to the primera league team and consequently failed in their attempt to reach the second phase of the competition .
deal completed in nick of time makaay will now be eligible for bayern ’ s champions league games as the deal went through before deportivo played in the third qualifying round of the tournament which takes place on august 13 .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said earlier in the week that if deportivo registered makaay for the champions league , the transfer would have been called off ; such is the club ’ s desire to build their european campaign around him .
makaay ’ s arrival will also spark a competition for places in the team as the current first choice striking duo is made up of giovanni elber and claudio pizzaro .
but as the club 's supervisory board chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday , " i am certain that we need a third top striker alongside elber and pizarro for a long season . "
beckenbauer wields his influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer rates makaay highly .
beckenbauer was personally involved in persuading commercial manager uli hoeness to pursue makaay , saying during the transfer negotiations that the club should meet deportivo ’ s conditions if they wanted to capture the dutchman ’ s signature .
" such a player would be an enrichment for bayern and the entire bundesliga .
whether we have to pay a million more is not important . "
it ’ s no surprise that makaay is such a coveted player .
the dutchman started his career at vitesse arnhem in his native country where he scored 11 goals in his first full season during the 1995/96 campaign .
he almost doubled that tally in his last season in holland before moving to tenerife where he managed only 21 goals in his two years with the club .
things really took off when makaay joined deportivo in 1999 .
accustomed to honors as well as scoring 79 league goals in four seasons with the club and nine times in last season 's champions league , makaay also won the liga title and the spanish super cup in 2000 and the spanish copa del rey and a second super cup in 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2003 the battle for the books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reaching for the stacks : will bound books be displaced by technology at the world 's libraries ?
in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture . "
a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?
and how can they handle this enormous task at a time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs ?
are these issues better tackled through traditional or digital means ?
the prevailing consensus at the congress : neither the pixel nor the printed word will prevail , but the problems are best solved by a mixture of both .
" the library of the future will be a hybrid , " says library director georg ruppelt .

in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture . "
a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?
and how can they handle this enormous task at a time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs ?

mirroring this statement , jürgen seefeldt and ludger syre submitted a paper describing the library of 2015 .
according to them , the initial experience with digital technology has failed to entirely displace the book and that will continue to be the case .
it seems that no one really wants to read earnestly for long periods of time in an electronic library .
a strategic alliance librarians hope to maximize the advantages of both traditional books and technology in a strategic alliance .
instead of an unwieldy card catalog , they foresee efficient networked databases , with access to the reserves of libraries around the world .
yet the old-school stacks will remain , including the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book " and all the other tactile elements .
ideally , both will be stored in an aesthetically pleasing space - a library that can serve as a social meeting place .
so , at the world library and information congress at least , the battle between the printed word and the pixel has been resolved through a peaceful co-existence , with each medium retained to suit its ideal purpose .
traditional bibliophiles can keep their books and techno-fans can have their pixels .
and maybe that 's the way it will go in the consumer market .
even john updike has licensed his upcoming book for digital distribution , a nod to those who would rather read on their lap-top . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de acid to acid , dust to dust in the labyrinth-like archives of the country 's libraries , millions of books are slowly crumbling to dust .

in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership . turkish president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday approved an amnesty law for kurdish rebels once engaged in a vicious war in the south-east of the country .
the law , adopted by parliament last week , offers a pardon for kurdish rebels who lay down their arms and surrender and who have not committed any violent crimes .
it also envisages reducing the jail sentences of those already imprisoned for violent acts , if they provide the authorities with information about their underground activities .
the amnesty , mainly aimed at rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- - now renamed kadek - will be valid for six months .
the kurdish rebels have fought a bloody separatist war in the country ’ s mainly kurdish south-east since 1984 , claiming the lives of more than 36,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan .
though kadek announced a cease-fire in 1999 following the capture of leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- , some 5,000 rebels are believed to be still holed up in mountainous bases in northern iraq .
ankara believes that around 2,000 rebels can qualify for the amnesty .
however , senior leaders and commanders of kadek have been excluded from it .
the amnesty is seen by some observers as an attempt by turkey to improve on its woeful record of human-rights record . of particular concern for the eu has been the rampant use of torture in prisons and police stations .
weakening the grip of the mighty military the amnesty law comes close on the heels of another landmark package of reforms passed by the turkish parliament last week . the new laws drastically curtail the power of the country ’ s powerful army generals , the self-proclaimed guardians of turkey ’ s secular constitution and long considered a potent force in turkish politics .
the measures aim to curb the political influence of the military , strips the military-dominated national security council -lrb- mgk -rrb- of its executive powers and turns it into a advisory body .
it also abolishes some anti-terror laws thought to crush freedom of thought and expression .
" this law is a step for democracy and freedom .
our aim is to reach the standards of countries already enjoying first class rights and freedoms , " turkish justice minister cemil cicek told parliament after the vote .
on monday , turkey 's military proved they would allow the reforms when they appointed an army general as secretary-general of the mgk , a move observors say will sharply reduce the power of the general as compared to his predecessors .
" the fact that a four-star general will be heading the secretariat does n't really mean that the military will be as instrumental as they were in the past .
the functions are no longer there , " sedat ergin , ankara bureau chief for turkey 's daily hurriyet told reuters .
all for the sake of eu membership the latest measures are all part of turkey ’ s attempt to convince brussels of its commitment to a reformist agenda and fall into the seventh of a series of so-called " harmonization packages " that would bring turkey into line with its would-be eu partners and eventually qualify it for membership of the european union .
brussels says it will not hold accession talks with turkey - the only eu candidate country with a predominantly muslim population - unless it first implements a wide-ranging series of measures that would meet eu criteria setting standards for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which every eu candidate must fulfill .
for ankara , this means nothing short of revamping its much of system of governance , which is considered riddled by corruption , poor on human rights and largely controlled by the fiercely secular army generals who are wary of both muslim fundamentalism and kurdish separatism .
road to eu club remains rocky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan though previous governments began tackling the formidable task by pushing through past eu harmonization bills , the present ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- has stepped up the pace of reforms by bolstering rights and freedoms for the country ’ s estimated 12 million-strong kurdish minority .
however major challenges remain in the form of an uneasy relationship between the powerful military and the akp .
the secular-minded army generals - who forced an islamist government out of office in 1997 - remain suspicious of the akp ’ s islamist roots , though its leaders have disavowed them and have promised to support democratic reform and keep religion out of politics .
the generals are also jittery that the emergence of a kurdish quasi-state next door in iraq might stir aspirations among turkey ’ s kurdish minority population of greater freedom and might be reinforced by the eu ’ s insistence on minority rights .
turkey ’ s goal of eu membership remains further complicated , this time by a debate outside its borders , with some eu officials saying turkey with its predominantly muslim population should not become a member because its cultural identity and history are not european enough .
for now however the eu has welcomed turkey ’ s latest measures to help smooth its path into the club .
cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , told reuters , " our reaction is very positive .
of course we all want to look at the small print and the implementation , but this goes exactly in the direction of fulfilling the copenhagen criteria . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey takes the cultural route to the eu turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations .

germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly . the on-going saga that is germany ’ s can and bottle deposit system took another embarrassing turn on wednesday when the president of the european commission , romano prodi , reportedly called on gerhard schröder ’ s government to sort out the messy situation . an article published in the mass circulation tabloid bild reported that prodi had issued an ultimatum to the german chancellor to bring the chaos to an end .
in a letter to schröder , prodi threatened germany with a “ contractual violation procedure ” should the planned october 1 launch of the permanent network of deposit machines not come into existence .
the ec president also demanded that the current compulsory deposit on single-use packaging be suspended until the final system is up and running . a government spokesman on wednesday said the letter bild referred to was had been sent to berlin last month .
" we 're on the same page as brussels , " said the spokesman .
" an extension of the temporary rules is out of the question . " it is not the first time the ec has spoken out about the situation in germany regarding the deposit system but the severity of the tone and the personal intervention of romano prodi take the disagreement to a more serious level . ec claimed system unfair to foreign businesses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frederik -lrb- frits -rrb- bolkestein .
in july , the european commission claimed that the interim arrangement for handling the deposit , which came into force at the start of the year , could conflict with eu laws on free movement of goods .
claiming that the system had drastically reduced sales of beverages in recyclable containers , ec internal market commissioner frits bolkestein said at the time that he believed the present system in germany put foreign filling companies at a disadvantage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.08.2003 turkey pushes forward on eu reform course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demands for change are growing , especially among turkey 's kurdish minority .
in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership . turkish president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday approved an amnesty law for kurdish rebels once engaged in a vicious war in the south-east of the country .
the law , adopted by parliament last week , offers a pardon for kurdish rebels who lay down their arms and surrender and who have not committed any violent crimes .
it also envisages reducing the jail sentences of those already imprisoned for violent acts , if they provide the authorities with information about their underground activities .
the amnesty , mainly aimed at rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- - now renamed kadek - will be valid for six months .
the kurdish rebels have fought a bloody separatist war in the country ’ s mainly kurdish south-east since 1984 , claiming the lives of more than 36,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan .
though kadek announced a cease-fire in 1999 following the capture of leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- , some 5,000 rebels are believed to be still holed up in mountainous bases in northern iraq .
ankara believes that around 2,000 rebels can qualify for the amnesty .
however , senior leaders and commanders of kadek have been excluded from it .
the amnesty is seen by some observers as an attempt by turkey to improve on its woeful record of human-rights record . of particular concern for the eu has been the rampant use of torture in prisons and police stations .
weakening the grip of the mighty military the amnesty law comes close on the heels of another landmark package of reforms passed by the turkish parliament last week . the new laws drastically curtail the power of the country ’ s powerful army generals , the self-proclaimed guardians of turkey ’ s secular constitution and long considered a potent force in turkish politics .
the measures aim to curb the political influence of the military , strips the military-dominated national security council -lrb- mgk -rrb- of its executive powers and turns it into a advisory body .
it also abolishes some anti-terror laws thought to crush freedom of thought and expression .
" this law is a step for democracy and freedom .
our aim is to reach the standards of countries already enjoying first class rights and freedoms , " turkish justice minister cemil cicek told parliament after the vote .
on monday , turkey 's military proved they would allow the reforms when they appointed an army general as secretary-general of the mgk , a move observors say will sharply reduce the power of the general as compared to his predecessors .
" the fact that a four-star general will be heading the secretariat does n't really mean that the military will be as instrumental as they were in the past .
the functions are no longer there , " sedat ergin , ankara bureau chief for turkey 's daily hurriyet told reuters .
all for the sake of eu membership the latest measures are all part of turkey ’ s attempt to convince brussels of its commitment to a reformist agenda and fall into the seventh of a series of so-called " harmonization packages " that would bring turkey into line with its would-be eu partners and eventually qualify it for membership of the european union .
brussels says it will not hold accession talks with turkey - the only eu candidate country with a predominantly muslim population - unless it first implements a wide-ranging series of measures that would meet eu criteria setting standards for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which every eu candidate must fulfill .
for ankara , this means nothing short of revamping its much of system of governance , which is considered riddled by corruption , poor on human rights and largely controlled by the fiercely secular army generals who are wary of both muslim fundamentalism and kurdish separatism .
road to eu club remains rocky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan though previous governments began tackling the formidable task by pushing through past eu harmonization bills , the present ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- has stepped up the pace of reforms by bolstering rights and freedoms for the country ’ s estimated 12 million-strong kurdish minority .
however major challenges remain in the form of an uneasy relationship between the powerful military and the akp .
the secular-minded army generals - who forced an islamist government out of office in 1997 - remain suspicious of the akp ’ s islamist roots , though its leaders have disavowed them and have promised to support democratic reform and keep religion out of politics .
the generals are also jittery that the emergence of a kurdish quasi-state next door in iraq might stir aspirations among turkey ’ s kurdish minority population of greater freedom and might be reinforced by the eu ’ s insistence on minority rights .
turkey ’ s goal of eu membership remains further complicated , this time by a debate outside its borders , with some eu officials saying turkey with its predominantly muslim population should not become a member because its cultural identity and history are not european enough .
for now however the eu has welcomed turkey ’ s latest measures to help smooth its path into the club .
cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , told reuters , " our reaction is very positive .

germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly . the on-going saga that is germany ’ s can and bottle deposit system took another embarrassing turn on wednesday when the president of the european commission , romano prodi , reportedly called on gerhard schröder ’ s government to sort out the messy situation . an article published in the mass circulation tabloid bild reported that prodi had issued an ultimatum to the german chancellor to bring the chaos to an end .
in a letter to schröder , prodi threatened germany with a “ contractual violation procedure ” should the planned october 1 launch of the permanent network of deposit machines not come into existence .
the ec president also demanded that the current compulsory deposit on single-use packaging be suspended until the final system is up and running . a government spokesman on wednesday said the letter bild referred to was had been sent to berlin last month .
" we 're on the same page as brussels , " said the spokesman .
" an extension of the temporary rules is out of the question . " it is not the first time the ec has spoken out about the situation in germany regarding the deposit system but the severity of the tone and the personal intervention of romano prodi take the disagreement to a more serious level . ec claimed system unfair to foreign businesses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frederik -lrb- frits -rrb- bolkestein .
in july , the european commission claimed that the interim arrangement for handling the deposit , which came into force at the start of the year , could conflict with eu laws on free movement of goods .
claiming that the system had drastically reduced sales of beverages in recyclable containers , ec internal market commissioner frits bolkestein said at the time that he believed the present system in germany put foreign filling companies at a disadvantage .
germany ’ s environment ministry spokesman michael schrören defended the system in a statement : “ there are no signs that imported products are disadvantaged by the current interim deposit rule .
on the contrary , 15 percent more foreign mineral water than before has been sold since the introduction of the deposit . ”
german environment minister jürgen trittin also sent a letter to the ec asking for proof that french mineral water suppliers had seen lower export sales due to the deposit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin however , despite the exchange of words , trittin told the german news agency dpa soon after : “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission . ” the eu threatened to take legal action against germany as recently as last month but then changed its mind , demanding only that the system due to be introduced in october be replaced by an eu approved alternative . plagued with problems at home on a national level , the nationwide interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has been plagued by problems since its introduction in january but none has been more damaging than the german beverage industry ’ s decision to suspend the expensive operation in july .
the industry claimed that there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the investment of billions of euros , which caused an angry response from trittin who told the industry that it must stand by its promise to adhere to the recycling law . speaking at the time of the decision , peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , said in a statement , “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs .
we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” plan to simplify recycling backfires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good idea badly managed ?
the deposit system or “ dosenpfand ” was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers by charging consumers a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles , encouraging them to return the empties to the place of purchase in order to get their money back . government hopes that the system would increase recycling have been dashed by complaints from the business community and consumers who say the scheme is inconvenient and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the interim deposit system was expected to be replaced on october 1 by the permanent network of collection machines .
however , the environment ministry will have to restart negotiations with the beverage industry in an attempt to resurrect the system if it is not to incur more wrath from the european commission and possible legal action . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beverage industry balks at can deposit in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers .

haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .
the long protective market will now experience measured influence from foreign investors via saban .
" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .
" we look forward to completing the transaction . "
his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .

the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .
the attempted hijacking of the deal fell through when apax 's partner , the carlyle group , dropped out leaving the road clear for saban .

during that time , they attempted to offload the group a number of times in a bid to recover some of the billions of euros they had lent leo kirch , turning the on-going saga surrounding the bidding war into a turbulent auction .
german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .
but saban had other ideas and bauer was elbowed aside , leaving the american to sign a deal in march .
however , that attempt failed in june after saban had problems with financing .
his determination to get into the german market , however , never waivered .
" i would have tried -lrb- to buy prosieben -rrb- ten times if i had failed nine times , " saban said according to the german news agency dpa .
a kirch spokesman said the deal is expected to be signed in the next few days .
once the deal is closed , saban is set to also make a public offer to buy prosieben 's listed preference shares for a price around the minimum legally possible , which stands at € 5.60-5.65 .

haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .
the long protective market will now experience measured influence from foreign investors via saban .
" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .
" we look forward to completing the transaction . "
his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .
but it wo n't likely be reflected when prosieben ceo urs rohner releases the figures for the first half of the year this thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haim saban backed by private equity firms , saban 's offer of € 7.50 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per share for the 72 percent of unlisted but vote-wielding ordinary stock was accepted just two months after his first attempt failed .
the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .
the attempted hijacking of the deal fell through when apax 's partner , the carlyle group , dropped out leaving the road clear for saban .
" the vote -lrb- for saban 's bid -rrb- was unanimous , " said a spokesman for kirchmedia .
kirch 's crown jewel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch the creditors in charge of the bankrupt company 's crown jewel have been trying to sell prosiebensat.1 for over a year .
during that time , they attempted to offload the group a number of times in a bid to recover some of the billions of euros they had lent leo kirch , turning the on-going saga surrounding the bidding war into a turbulent auction .
german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .
but saban had other ideas and bauer was elbowed aside , leaving the american to sign a deal in march .
however , that attempt failed in june after saban had problems with financing .
his determination to get into the german market , however , never waivered .
" i would have tried -lrb- to buy prosieben -rrb- ten times if i had failed nine times , " saban said according to the german news agency dpa .
a kirch spokesman said the deal is expected to be signed in the next few days .
once the deal is closed , saban is set to also make a public offer to buy prosieben 's listed preference shares for a price around the minimum legally possible , which stands at € 5.60-5.65 .
his title of number one challenger to the german and european media crowns will then be officially recognized . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. billionare set to take over bankrupt german media group one of america 's most successful media entrepreneurs , haim saban , has seen off the competition in the battle to take over the bankrupt german kirchmedia group .

in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership . turkish president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday approved an amnesty law for kurdish rebels once engaged in a vicious war in the south-east of the country .
the law , adopted by parliament last week , offers a pardon for kurdish rebels who lay down their arms and surrender and who have not committed any violent crimes .
it also envisages reducing the jail sentences of those already imprisoned for violent acts , if they provide the authorities with information about their underground activities .
the amnesty , mainly aimed at rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- - now renamed kadek - will be valid for six months .
the kurdish rebels have fought a bloody separatist war in the country ’ s mainly kurdish south-east since 1984 , claiming the lives of more than 36,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan .
though kadek announced a cease-fire in 1999 following the capture of leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- , some 5,000 rebels are believed to be still holed up in mountainous bases in northern iraq .
ankara believes that around 2,000 rebels can qualify for the amnesty .
however , senior leaders and commanders of kadek have been excluded from it .
the amnesty is seen by some observers as an attempt by turkey to improve on its woeful record of human-rights record . of particular concern for the eu has been the rampant use of torture in prisons and police stations .
weakening the grip of the mighty military the amnesty law comes close on the heels of another landmark package of reforms passed by the turkish parliament last week . the new laws drastically curtail the power of the country ’ s powerful army generals , the self-proclaimed guardians of turkey ’ s secular constitution and long considered a potent force in turkish politics .
the measures aim to curb the political influence of the military , strips the military-dominated national security council -lrb- mgk -rrb- of its executive powers and turns it into a advisory body .
it also abolishes some anti-terror laws thought to crush freedom of thought and expression .
" this law is a step for democracy and freedom .
our aim is to reach the standards of countries already enjoying first class rights and freedoms , " turkish justice minister cemil cicek told parliament after the vote .
on monday , turkey 's military proved they would allow the reforms when they appointed an army general as secretary-general of the mgk , a move observors say will sharply reduce the power of the general as compared to his predecessors .
" the fact that a four-star general will be heading the secretariat does n't really mean that the military will be as instrumental as they were in the past .
the functions are no longer there , " sedat ergin , ankara bureau chief for turkey 's daily hurriyet told reuters .
all for the sake of eu membership the latest measures are all part of turkey ’ s attempt to convince brussels of its commitment to a reformist agenda and fall into the seventh of a series of so-called " harmonization packages " that would bring turkey into line with its would-be eu partners and eventually qualify it for membership of the european union .
brussels says it will not hold accession talks with turkey - the only eu candidate country with a predominantly muslim population - unless it first implements a wide-ranging series of measures that would meet eu criteria setting standards for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which every eu candidate must fulfill .
for ankara , this means nothing short of revamping its much of system of governance , which is considered riddled by corruption , poor on human rights and largely controlled by the fiercely secular army generals who are wary of both muslim fundamentalism and kurdish separatism .
road to eu club remains rocky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan though previous governments began tackling the formidable task by pushing through past eu harmonization bills , the present ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- has stepped up the pace of reforms by bolstering rights and freedoms for the country ’ s estimated 12 million-strong kurdish minority .
however major challenges remain in the form of an uneasy relationship between the powerful military and the akp .
the secular-minded army generals - who forced an islamist government out of office in 1997 - remain suspicious of the akp ’ s islamist roots , though its leaders have disavowed them and have promised to support democratic reform and keep religion out of politics .
the generals are also jittery that the emergence of a kurdish quasi-state next door in iraq might stir aspirations among turkey ’ s kurdish minority population of greater freedom and might be reinforced by the eu ’ s insistence on minority rights .
turkey ’ s goal of eu membership remains further complicated , this time by a debate outside its borders , with some eu officials saying turkey with its predominantly muslim population should not become a member because its cultural identity and history are not european enough .
for now however the eu has welcomed turkey ’ s latest measures to help smooth its path into the club .
cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , told reuters , " our reaction is very positive .
of course we all want to look at the small print and the implementation , but this goes exactly in the direction of fulfilling the copenhagen criteria .

germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly . the on-going saga that is germany ’ s can and bottle deposit system took another embarrassing turn on wednesday when the president of the european commission , romano prodi , reportedly called on gerhard schröder ’ s government to sort out the messy situation . an article published in the mass circulation tabloid bild reported that prodi had issued an ultimatum to the german chancellor to bring the chaos to an end .
in a letter to schröder , prodi threatened germany with a “ contractual violation procedure ” should the planned october 1 launch of the permanent network of deposit machines not come into existence .
the ec president also demanded that the current compulsory deposit on single-use packaging be suspended until the final system is up and running . a government spokesman on wednesday said the letter bild referred to was had been sent to berlin last month .
" we 're on the same page as brussels , " said the spokesman .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.08.2003 makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former thorn in the side becomes a rose in the bayern garden bayern munich pulled out all the stops to secure the signing of dutch international striker roy makaay in an attempt to mount a more serious assault on the european champions league this season . it ’ s a well known fact that german soccer clubs have been experiencing financial woes in the wake of the television rights crisis that has plagued the bundesliga for the past two seasons .
as if to emphasis the point further , the summer transfer market in germany was relatively quiet with the big clubs seemingly satisfied with their current squads as the season came closer to kick off .
even the champions were spending thriftily on the eve of their title defense .
that is until this week when bayern munich revealed on monday that dutch striker roy makaay would be joining them from deportivo la coruna in spain for an undisclosed sum .
the fee is rumored to be somewhere between deportivo ’ s estimated € 20 million -lrb- $ 22.61million -rrb- price tag and bayern ’ s offer of € 16 million , with some voices whispering that it could be the second most expensive in the league ’ s 40-year history .
the 28-year-old could start repaying that financial layout when he makes his debut in the bundesliga game at hanover 96 on saturday , august 9 .
euro hopes boosted by arrival makaay , who won the golden boot award for europe 's top scorer last season , after netting 29 goals in 38 league matches for deportivo , joins the bavarian giants in a four-year deal as they prepare to defend their standing as number one in the bundesliga and steel themselves for another assault on the european champions league .
after the disappointment of last season ’ s short-lived european adventure , makaay ’ s arrival is expected to strengthen the team as bayern goes up against the likes of real madrid , juventus turin and manchester united .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern will be hoping for a better european challenge this year .
the irony will not be lost on the many bayern fans who have enthusiastically welcomed makaay to the club .
makaay was instrumental in setting the wreaking ball in motion on bayern ’ s ill-fated and disastrous foray into last season ’ s champions league campaign .
as the main danger man for deportivo , makaay scored three times in the olympic stadium as bayern opened their campaign with a 3-2 defeat to the primera league team and consequently failed in their attempt to reach the second phase of the competition .
deal completed in nick of time makaay will now be eligible for bayern ’ s champions league games as the deal went through before deportivo played in the third qualifying round of the tournament which takes place on august 13 .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said earlier in the week that if deportivo registered makaay for the champions league , the transfer would have been called off ; such is the club ’ s desire to build their european campaign around him .
makaay ’ s arrival will also spark a competition for places in the team as the current first choice striking duo is made up of giovanni elber and claudio pizzaro .
but as the club 's supervisory board chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday , " i am certain that we need a third top striker alongside elber and pizarro for a long season . "
beckenbauer wields his influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer rates makaay highly .
beckenbauer was personally involved in persuading commercial manager uli hoeness to pursue makaay , saying during the transfer negotiations that the club should meet deportivo ’ s conditions if they wanted to capture the dutchman ’ s signature .
" such a player would be an enrichment for bayern and the entire bundesliga .
whether we have to pay a million more is not important . "
it ’ s no surprise that makaay is such a coveted player .
the dutchman started his career at vitesse arnhem in his native country where he scored 11 goals in his first full season during the 1995/96 campaign .
he almost doubled that tally in his last season in holland before moving to tenerife where he managed only 21 goals in his two years with the club .
things really took off when makaay joined deportivo in 1999 .
accustomed to honors as well as scoring 79 league goals in four seasons with the club and nine times in last season 's champions league , makaay also won the liga title and the spanish super cup in 2000 and the spanish copa del rey and a second super cup in 2002 .
bayern will be hoping that makaay ’ s expertise will help them to secure more honors at home and abroad . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de another easy bundesliga title for bayern ?

in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture . "
a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?
and how can they handle this enormous task at a time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs ?
are these issues better tackled through traditional or digital means ?
the prevailing consensus at the congress : neither the pixel nor the printed word will prevail , but the problems are best solved by a mixture of both .
" the library of the future will be a hybrid , " says library director georg ruppelt .
" the hybrid library allows electronic access to everything possible , but printed books will remain . "
thus , digital and analog will coexist peacefully side-by-side .
mirroring this statement , jürgen seefeldt and ludger syre submitted a paper describing the library of 2015 .
according to them , the initial experience with digital technology has failed to entirely displace the book and that will continue to be the case .
it seems that no one really wants to read earnestly for long periods of time in an electronic library .
a strategic alliance librarians hope to maximize the advantages of both traditional books and technology in a strategic alliance .
instead of an unwieldy card catalog , they foresee efficient networked databases , with access to the reserves of libraries around the world .
yet the old-school stacks will remain , including the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book " and all the other tactile elements .
ideally , both will be stored in an aesthetically pleasing space - a library that can serve as a social meeting place .
so , at the world library and information congress at least , the battle between the printed word and the pixel has been resolved through a peaceful co-existence , with each medium retained to suit its ideal purpose .
traditional bibliophiles can keep their books and techno-fans can have their pixels .
and maybe that 's the way it will go in the consumer market .
even john updike has licensed his upcoming book for digital distribution , a nod to those who would rather read on their lap-top . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de acid to acid , dust to dust in the labyrinth-like archives of the country 's libraries , millions of books are slowly crumbling to dust .

in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture . "
a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?
and how can they handle this enormous task at a time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs ?
are these issues better tackled through traditional or digital means ?
the prevailing consensus at the congress : neither the pixel nor the printed word will prevail , but the problems are best solved by a mixture of both .
" the library of the future will be a hybrid , " says library director georg ruppelt .
" the hybrid library allows electronic access to everything possible , but printed books will remain . "
thus , digital and analog will coexist peacefully side-by-side .
mirroring this statement , jürgen seefeldt and ludger syre submitted a paper describing the library of 2015 .
according to them , the initial experience with digital technology has failed to entirely displace the book and that will continue to be the case .
it seems that no one really wants to read earnestly for long periods of time in an electronic library .
a strategic alliance librarians hope to maximize the advantages of both traditional books and technology in a strategic alliance .
instead of an unwieldy card catalog , they foresee efficient networked databases , with access to the reserves of libraries around the world .
yet the old-school stacks will remain , including the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book " and all the other tactile elements .
ideally , both will be stored in an aesthetically pleasing space - a library that can serve as a social meeting place .
so , at the world library and information congress at least , the battle between the printed word and the pixel has been resolved through a peaceful co-existence , with each medium retained to suit its ideal purpose .
traditional bibliophiles can keep their books and techno-fans can have their pixels .
and maybe that 's the way it will go in the consumer market .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.08.2003 makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former thorn in the side becomes a rose in the bayern garden bayern munich pulled out all the stops to secure the signing of dutch international striker roy makaay in an attempt to mount a more serious assault on the european champions league this season . it ’ s a well known fact that german soccer clubs have been experiencing financial woes in the wake of the television rights crisis that has plagued the bundesliga for the past two seasons .
as if to emphasis the point further , the summer transfer market in germany was relatively quiet with the big clubs seemingly satisfied with their current squads as the season came closer to kick off .
even the champions were spending thriftily on the eve of their title defense .
that is until this week when bayern munich revealed on monday that dutch striker roy makaay would be joining them from deportivo la coruna in spain for an undisclosed sum .
the fee is rumored to be somewhere between deportivo ’ s estimated € 20 million -lrb- $ 22.61million -rrb- price tag and bayern ’ s offer of € 16 million , with some voices whispering that it could be the second most expensive in the league ’ s 40-year history .
the 28-year-old could start repaying that financial layout when he makes his debut in the bundesliga game at hanover 96 on saturday , august 9 .
euro hopes boosted by arrival makaay , who won the golden boot award for europe 's top scorer last season , after netting 29 goals in 38 league matches for deportivo , joins the bavarian giants in a four-year deal as they prepare to defend their standing as number one in the bundesliga and steel themselves for another assault on the european champions league .
after the disappointment of last season ’ s short-lived european adventure , makaay ’ s arrival is expected to strengthen the team as bayern goes up against the likes of real madrid , juventus turin and manchester united .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern will be hoping for a better european challenge this year .
the irony will not be lost on the many bayern fans who have enthusiastically welcomed makaay to the club .
makaay was instrumental in setting the wreaking ball in motion on bayern ’ s ill-fated and disastrous foray into last season ’ s champions league campaign .
as the main danger man for deportivo , makaay scored three times in the olympic stadium as bayern opened their campaign with a 3-2 defeat to the primera league team and consequently failed in their attempt to reach the second phase of the competition .
deal completed in nick of time makaay will now be eligible for bayern ’ s champions league games as the deal went through before deportivo played in the third qualifying round of the tournament which takes place on august 13 .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said earlier in the week that if deportivo registered makaay for the champions league , the transfer would have been called off ; such is the club ’ s desire to build their european campaign around him .
makaay ’ s arrival will also spark a competition for places in the team as the current first choice striking duo is made up of giovanni elber and claudio pizzaro .
but as the club 's supervisory board chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday , " i am certain that we need a third top striker alongside elber and pizarro for a long season . "
beckenbauer wields his influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer rates makaay highly .
beckenbauer was personally involved in persuading commercial manager uli hoeness to pursue makaay , saying during the transfer negotiations that the club should meet deportivo ’ s conditions if they wanted to capture the dutchman ’ s signature .
" such a player would be an enrichment for bayern and the entire bundesliga .
whether we have to pay a million more is not important . "
it ’ s no surprise that makaay is such a coveted player .
the dutchman started his career at vitesse arnhem in his native country where he scored 11 goals in his first full season during the 1995/96 campaign .
he almost doubled that tally in his last season in holland before moving to tenerife where he managed only 21 goals in his two years with the club .
things really took off when makaay joined deportivo in 1999 .
accustomed to honors as well as scoring 79 league goals in four seasons with the club and nine times in last season 's champions league , makaay also won the liga title and the spanish super cup in 2000 and the spanish copa del rey and a second super cup in 2002 .

the irony will not be lost on the many bayern fans who have enthusiastically welcomed makaay to the club .
makaay was instrumental in setting the wreaking ball in motion on bayern ’ s ill-fated and disastrous foray into last season ’ s champions league campaign .
as the main danger man for deportivo , makaay scored three times in the olympic stadium as bayern opened their campaign with a 3-2 defeat to the primera league team and consequently failed in their attempt to reach the second phase of the competition .
deal completed in nick of time makaay will now be eligible for bayern ’ s champions league games as the deal went through before deportivo played in the third qualifying round of the tournament which takes place on august 13 .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said earlier in the week that if deportivo registered makaay for the champions league , the transfer would have been called off ; such is the club ’ s desire to build their european campaign around him .
makaay ’ s arrival will also spark a competition for places in the team as the current first choice striking duo is made up of giovanni elber and claudio pizzaro .
but as the club 's supervisory board chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday , " i am certain that we need a third top striker alongside elber and pizarro for a long season . "
beckenbauer wields his influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer rates makaay highly .
beckenbauer was personally involved in persuading commercial manager uli hoeness to pursue makaay , saying during the transfer negotiations that the club should meet deportivo ’ s conditions if they wanted to capture the dutchman ’ s signature .
" such a player would be an enrichment for bayern and the entire bundesliga .
whether we have to pay a million more is not important . "
it ’ s no surprise that makaay is such a coveted player .
the dutchman started his career at vitesse arnhem in his native country where he scored 11 goals in his first full season during the 1995/96 campaign .
he almost doubled that tally in his last season in holland before moving to tenerife where he managed only 21 goals in his two years with the club .
things really took off when makaay joined deportivo in 1999 .
accustomed to honors as well as scoring 79 league goals in four seasons with the club and nine times in last season 's champions league , makaay also won the liga title and the spanish super cup in 2000 and the spanish copa del rey and a second super cup in 2002 .

but as the club 's supervisory board chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday , " i am certain that we need a third top striker alongside elber and pizarro for a long season . "
beckenbauer wields his influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer rates makaay highly .
beckenbauer was personally involved in persuading commercial manager uli hoeness to pursue makaay , saying during the transfer negotiations that the club should meet deportivo ’ s conditions if they wanted to capture the dutchman ’ s signature .
" such a player would be an enrichment for bayern and the entire bundesliga .
whether we have to pay a million more is not important . "
it ’ s no surprise that makaay is such a coveted player .
the dutchman started his career at vitesse arnhem in his native country where he scored 11 goals in his first full season during the 1995/96 campaign .
he almost doubled that tally in his last season in holland before moving to tenerife where he managed only 21 goals in his two years with the club .
things really took off when makaay joined deportivo in 1999 .
accustomed to honors as well as scoring 79 league goals in four seasons with the club and nine times in last season 's champions league , makaay also won the liga title and the spanish super cup in 2000 and the spanish copa del rey and a second super cup in 2002 .
bayern will be hoping that makaay ’ s expertise will help them to secure more honors at home and abroad . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de another easy bundesliga title for bayern ?

haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .
the long protective market will now experience measured influence from foreign investors via saban .
" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .
" we look forward to completing the transaction . "
his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .
but it wo n't likely be reflected when prosieben ceo urs rohner releases the figures for the first half of the year this thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haim saban backed by private equity firms , saban 's offer of € 7.50 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per share for the 72 percent of unlisted but vote-wielding ordinary stock was accepted just two months after his first attempt failed .
the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .
the attempted hijacking of the deal fell through when apax 's partner , the carlyle group , dropped out leaving the road clear for saban .
" the vote -lrb- for saban 's bid -rrb- was unanimous , " said a spokesman for kirchmedia .
kirch 's crown jewel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch the creditors in charge of the bankrupt company 's crown jewel have been trying to sell prosiebensat.1 for over a year .
during that time , they attempted to offload the group a number of times in a bid to recover some of the billions of euros they had lent leo kirch , turning the on-going saga surrounding the bidding war into a turbulent auction .
german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .
but saban had other ideas and bauer was elbowed aside , leaving the american to sign a deal in march .
however , that attempt failed in june after saban had problems with financing .
his determination to get into the german market , however , never waivered .
" i would have tried -lrb- to buy prosieben -rrb- ten times if i had failed nine times , " saban said according to the german news agency dpa .
a kirch spokesman said the deal is expected to be signed in the next few days .
once the deal is closed , saban is set to also make a public offer to buy prosieben 's listed preference shares for a price around the minimum legally possible , which stands at € 5.60-5.65 .

germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly . the on-going saga that is germany ’ s can and bottle deposit system took another embarrassing turn on wednesday when the president of the european commission , romano prodi , reportedly called on gerhard schröder ’ s government to sort out the messy situation . an article published in the mass circulation tabloid bild reported that prodi had issued an ultimatum to the german chancellor to bring the chaos to an end .
in a letter to schröder , prodi threatened germany with a “ contractual violation procedure ” should the planned october 1 launch of the permanent network of deposit machines not come into existence .
the ec president also demanded that the current compulsory deposit on single-use packaging be suspended until the final system is up and running . a government spokesman on wednesday said the letter bild referred to was had been sent to berlin last month .
" we 're on the same page as brussels , " said the spokesman .
" an extension of the temporary rules is out of the question . " it is not the first time the ec has spoken out about the situation in germany regarding the deposit system but the severity of the tone and the personal intervention of romano prodi take the disagreement to a more serious level . ec claimed system unfair to foreign businesses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frederik -lrb- frits -rrb- bolkestein .
in july , the european commission claimed that the interim arrangement for handling the deposit , which came into force at the start of the year , could conflict with eu laws on free movement of goods .
claiming that the system had drastically reduced sales of beverages in recyclable containers , ec internal market commissioner frits bolkestein said at the time that he believed the present system in germany put foreign filling companies at a disadvantage .
germany ’ s environment ministry spokesman michael schrören defended the system in a statement : “ there are no signs that imported products are disadvantaged by the current interim deposit rule .
on the contrary , 15 percent more foreign mineral water than before has been sold since the introduction of the deposit . ”
german environment minister jürgen trittin also sent a letter to the ec asking for proof that french mineral water suppliers had seen lower export sales due to the deposit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin however , despite the exchange of words , trittin told the german news agency dpa soon after : “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission . ” the eu threatened to take legal action against germany as recently as last month but then changed its mind , demanding only that the system due to be introduced in october be replaced by an eu approved alternative . plagued with problems at home on a national level , the nationwide interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has been plagued by problems since its introduction in january but none has been more damaging than the german beverage industry ’ s decision to suspend the expensive operation in july .
the industry claimed that there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the investment of billions of euros , which caused an angry response from trittin who told the industry that it must stand by its promise to adhere to the recycling law . speaking at the time of the decision , peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , said in a statement , “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs .
we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” plan to simplify recycling backfires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good idea badly managed ?
the deposit system or “ dosenpfand ” was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers by charging consumers a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles , encouraging them to return the empties to the place of purchase in order to get their money back . government hopes that the system would increase recycling have been dashed by complaints from the business community and consumers who say the scheme is inconvenient and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the interim deposit system was expected to be replaced on october 1 by the permanent network of collection machines .
however , the environment ministry will have to restart negotiations with the beverage industry in an attempt to resurrect the system if it is not to incur more wrath from the european commission and possible legal action . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german beverage industry balks at can deposit in a surprise move , germany ’ s beverage industry said it will no longer build an expensive nationwide deposit system for cans and plastic bottles that was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers .

in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership . turkish president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday approved an amnesty law for kurdish rebels once engaged in a vicious war in the south-east of the country .
the law , adopted by parliament last week , offers a pardon for kurdish rebels who lay down their arms and surrender and who have not committed any violent crimes .
it also envisages reducing the jail sentences of those already imprisoned for violent acts , if they provide the authorities with information about their underground activities .
the amnesty , mainly aimed at rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- - now renamed kadek - will be valid for six months .
the kurdish rebels have fought a bloody separatist war in the country ’ s mainly kurdish south-east since 1984 , claiming the lives of more than 36,000 people .

though kadek announced a cease-fire in 1999 following the capture of leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- , some 5,000 rebels are believed to be still holed up in mountainous bases in northern iraq .
ankara believes that around 2,000 rebels can qualify for the amnesty .
however , senior leaders and commanders of kadek have been excluded from it .
the amnesty is seen by some observers as an attempt by turkey to improve on its woeful record of human-rights record . of particular concern for the eu has been the rampant use of torture in prisons and police stations .
weakening the grip of the mighty military the amnesty law comes close on the heels of another landmark package of reforms passed by the turkish parliament last week . the new laws drastically curtail the power of the country ’ s powerful army generals , the self-proclaimed guardians of turkey ’ s secular constitution and long considered a potent force in turkish politics .
the measures aim to curb the political influence of the military , strips the military-dominated national security council -lrb- mgk -rrb- of its executive powers and turns it into a advisory body .
it also abolishes some anti-terror laws thought to crush freedom of thought and expression .
" this law is a step for democracy and freedom .
our aim is to reach the standards of countries already enjoying first class rights and freedoms , " turkish justice minister cemil cicek told parliament after the vote .
on monday , turkey 's military proved they would allow the reforms when they appointed an army general as secretary-general of the mgk , a move observors say will sharply reduce the power of the general as compared to his predecessors .
" the fact that a four-star general will be heading the secretariat does n't really mean that the military will be as instrumental as they were in the past .
the functions are no longer there , " sedat ergin , ankara bureau chief for turkey 's daily hurriyet told reuters .
all for the sake of eu membership the latest measures are all part of turkey ’ s attempt to convince brussels of its commitment to a reformist agenda and fall into the seventh of a series of so-called " harmonization packages " that would bring turkey into line with its would-be eu partners and eventually qualify it for membership of the european union .
brussels says it will not hold accession talks with turkey - the only eu candidate country with a predominantly muslim population - unless it first implements a wide-ranging series of measures that would meet eu criteria setting standards for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which every eu candidate must fulfill .
for ankara , this means nothing short of revamping its much of system of governance , which is considered riddled by corruption , poor on human rights and largely controlled by the fiercely secular army generals who are wary of both muslim fundamentalism and kurdish separatism .

the secular-minded army generals - who forced an islamist government out of office in 1997 - remain suspicious of the akp ’ s islamist roots , though its leaders have disavowed them and have promised to support democratic reform and keep religion out of politics .
the generals are also jittery that the emergence of a kurdish quasi-state next door in iraq might stir aspirations among turkey ’ s kurdish minority population of greater freedom and might be reinforced by the eu ’ s insistence on minority rights .

in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership . turkish president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday approved an amnesty law for kurdish rebels once engaged in a vicious war in the south-east of the country .
the law , adopted by parliament last week , offers a pardon for kurdish rebels who lay down their arms and surrender and who have not committed any violent crimes .
it also envisages reducing the jail sentences of those already imprisoned for violent acts , if they provide the authorities with information about their underground activities .
the amnesty , mainly aimed at rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- - now renamed kadek - will be valid for six months .
the kurdish rebels have fought a bloody separatist war in the country ’ s mainly kurdish south-east since 1984 , claiming the lives of more than 36,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan .
though kadek announced a cease-fire in 1999 following the capture of leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- , some 5,000 rebels are believed to be still holed up in mountainous bases in northern iraq .
ankara believes that around 2,000 rebels can qualify for the amnesty .
however , senior leaders and commanders of kadek have been excluded from it .
the amnesty is seen by some observers as an attempt by turkey to improve on its woeful record of human-rights record . of particular concern for the eu has been the rampant use of torture in prisons and police stations .
weakening the grip of the mighty military the amnesty law comes close on the heels of another landmark package of reforms passed by the turkish parliament last week . the new laws drastically curtail the power of the country ’ s powerful army generals , the self-proclaimed guardians of turkey ’ s secular constitution and long considered a potent force in turkish politics .
the measures aim to curb the political influence of the military , strips the military-dominated national security council -lrb- mgk -rrb- of its executive powers and turns it into a advisory body .
it also abolishes some anti-terror laws thought to crush freedom of thought and expression .
" this law is a step for democracy and freedom .
our aim is to reach the standards of countries already enjoying first class rights and freedoms , " turkish justice minister cemil cicek told parliament after the vote .
on monday , turkey 's military proved they would allow the reforms when they appointed an army general as secretary-general of the mgk , a move observors say will sharply reduce the power of the general as compared to his predecessors .
" the fact that a four-star general will be heading the secretariat does n't really mean that the military will be as instrumental as they were in the past .
the functions are no longer there , " sedat ergin , ankara bureau chief for turkey 's daily hurriyet told reuters .
all for the sake of eu membership the latest measures are all part of turkey ’ s attempt to convince brussels of its commitment to a reformist agenda and fall into the seventh of a series of so-called " harmonization packages " that would bring turkey into line with its would-be eu partners and eventually qualify it for membership of the european union .
brussels says it will not hold accession talks with turkey - the only eu candidate country with a predominantly muslim population - unless it first implements a wide-ranging series of measures that would meet eu criteria setting standards for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which every eu candidate must fulfill .
for ankara , this means nothing short of revamping its much of system of governance , which is considered riddled by corruption , poor on human rights and largely controlled by the fiercely secular army generals who are wary of both muslim fundamentalism and kurdish separatism .
road to eu club remains rocky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan though previous governments began tackling the formidable task by pushing through past eu harmonization bills , the present ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- has stepped up the pace of reforms by bolstering rights and freedoms for the country ’ s estimated 12 million-strong kurdish minority .
however major challenges remain in the form of an uneasy relationship between the powerful military and the akp .
the secular-minded army generals - who forced an islamist government out of office in 1997 - remain suspicious of the akp ’ s islamist roots , though its leaders have disavowed them and have promised to support democratic reform and keep religion out of politics .
the generals are also jittery that the emergence of a kurdish quasi-state next door in iraq might stir aspirations among turkey ’ s kurdish minority population of greater freedom and might be reinforced by the eu ’ s insistence on minority rights .
turkey ’ s goal of eu membership remains further complicated , this time by a debate outside its borders , with some eu officials saying turkey with its predominantly muslim population should not become a member because its cultural identity and history are not european enough .
for now however the eu has welcomed turkey ’ s latest measures to help smooth its path into the club .
cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , told reuters , " our reaction is very positive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2003 the battle for the books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reaching for the stacks : will bound books be displaced by technology at the world 's libraries ?
in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture . "
a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?
and how can they handle this enormous task at a time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs ?
are these issues better tackled through traditional or digital means ?
the prevailing consensus at the congress : neither the pixel nor the printed word will prevail , but the problems are best solved by a mixture of both .
" the library of the future will be a hybrid , " says library director georg ruppelt .
" the hybrid library allows electronic access to everything possible , but printed books will remain . "
thus , digital and analog will coexist peacefully side-by-side .
mirroring this statement , jürgen seefeldt and ludger syre submitted a paper describing the library of 2015 .
according to them , the initial experience with digital technology has failed to entirely displace the book and that will continue to be the case .
it seems that no one really wants to read earnestly for long periods of time in an electronic library .
a strategic alliance librarians hope to maximize the advantages of both traditional books and technology in a strategic alliance .
instead of an unwieldy card catalog , they foresee efficient networked databases , with access to the reserves of libraries around the world .
yet the old-school stacks will remain , including the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book " and all the other tactile elements .
ideally , both will be stored in an aesthetically pleasing space - a library that can serve as a social meeting place .
so , at the world library and information congress at least , the battle between the printed word and the pixel has been resolved through a peaceful co-existence , with each medium retained to suit its ideal purpose .
traditional bibliophiles can keep their books and techno-fans can have their pixels .
and maybe that 's the way it will go in the consumer market .
even john updike has licensed his upcoming book for digital distribution , a nod to those who would rather read on their lap-top . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de acid to acid , dust to dust in the labyrinth-like archives of the country 's libraries , millions of books are slowly crumbling to dust .

haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .
the long protective market will now experience measured influence from foreign investors via saban .
" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .
" we look forward to completing the transaction . "
his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .
but it wo n't likely be reflected when prosieben ceo urs rohner releases the figures for the first half of the year this thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haim saban backed by private equity firms , saban 's offer of € 7.50 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per share for the 72 percent of unlisted but vote-wielding ordinary stock was accepted just two months after his first attempt failed .
the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .
the attempted hijacking of the deal fell through when apax 's partner , the carlyle group , dropped out leaving the road clear for saban .
" the vote -lrb- for saban 's bid -rrb- was unanimous , " said a spokesman for kirchmedia .
kirch 's crown jewel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch the creditors in charge of the bankrupt company 's crown jewel have been trying to sell prosiebensat.1 for over a year .
during that time , they attempted to offload the group a number of times in a bid to recover some of the billions of euros they had lent leo kirch , turning the on-going saga surrounding the bidding war into a turbulent auction .
german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .
but saban had other ideas and bauer was elbowed aside , leaving the american to sign a deal in march .
however , that attempt failed in june after saban had problems with financing .
his determination to get into the german market , however , never waivered .
" i would have tried -lrb- to buy prosieben -rrb- ten times if i had failed nine times , " saban said according to the german news agency dpa .
a kirch spokesman said the deal is expected to be signed in the next few days .
once the deal is closed , saban is set to also make a public offer to buy prosieben 's listed preference shares for a price around the minimum legally possible , which stands at € 5.60-5.65 .

the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .

in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture . "
a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?
and how can they handle this enormous task at a time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs ?
are these issues better tackled through traditional or digital means ?
the prevailing consensus at the congress : neither the pixel nor the printed word will prevail , but the problems are best solved by a mixture of both .
" the library of the future will be a hybrid , " says library director georg ruppelt .
" the hybrid library allows electronic access to everything possible , but printed books will remain . "
thus , digital and analog will coexist peacefully side-by-side .
mirroring this statement , jürgen seefeldt and ludger syre submitted a paper describing the library of 2015 .
according to them , the initial experience with digital technology has failed to entirely displace the book and that will continue to be the case .
it seems that no one really wants to read earnestly for long periods of time in an electronic library .
a strategic alliance librarians hope to maximize the advantages of both traditional books and technology in a strategic alliance .
instead of an unwieldy card catalog , they foresee efficient networked databases , with access to the reserves of libraries around the world .
yet the old-school stacks will remain , including the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book " and all the other tactile elements .
ideally , both will be stored in an aesthetically pleasing space - a library that can serve as a social meeting place .
so , at the world library and information congress at least , the battle between the printed word and the pixel has been resolved through a peaceful co-existence , with each medium retained to suit its ideal purpose .
traditional bibliophiles can keep their books and techno-fans can have their pixels .
and maybe that 's the way it will go in the consumer market .

" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .
" we look forward to completing the transaction . "
his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .
but it wo n't likely be reflected when prosieben ceo urs rohner releases the figures for the first half of the year this thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haim saban backed by private equity firms , saban 's offer of € 7.50 -lrb- $ 8.50 -rrb- per share for the 72 percent of unlisted but vote-wielding ordinary stock was accepted just two months after his first attempt failed .
the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .
the attempted hijacking of the deal fell through when apax 's partner , the carlyle group , dropped out leaving the road clear for saban .
" the vote -lrb- for saban 's bid -rrb- was unanimous , " said a spokesman for kirchmedia .
kirch 's crown jewel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leo kirch the creditors in charge of the bankrupt company 's crown jewel have been trying to sell prosiebensat.1 for over a year .
during that time , they attempted to offload the group a number of times in a bid to recover some of the billions of euros they had lent leo kirch , turning the on-going saga surrounding the bidding war into a turbulent auction .
german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .
but saban had other ideas and bauer was elbowed aside , leaving the american to sign a deal in march .
however , that attempt failed in june after saban had problems with financing .
his determination to get into the german market , however , never waivered .
" i would have tried -lrb- to buy prosieben -rrb- ten times if i had failed nine times , " saban said according to the german news agency dpa .
a kirch spokesman said the deal is expected to be signed in the next few days .
once the deal is closed , saban is set to also make a public offer to buy prosieben 's listed preference shares for a price around the minimum legally possible , which stands at € 5.60-5.65 .

germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly . the on-going saga that is germany ’ s can and bottle deposit system took another embarrassing turn on wednesday when the president of the european commission , romano prodi , reportedly called on gerhard schröder ’ s government to sort out the messy situation . an article published in the mass circulation tabloid bild reported that prodi had issued an ultimatum to the german chancellor to bring the chaos to an end .
in a letter to schröder , prodi threatened germany with a “ contractual violation procedure ” should the planned october 1 launch of the permanent network of deposit machines not come into existence .
the ec president also demanded that the current compulsory deposit on single-use packaging be suspended until the final system is up and running . a government spokesman on wednesday said the letter bild referred to was had been sent to berlin last month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.08.2003 the battle for the books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reaching for the stacks : will bound books be displaced by technology at the world 's libraries ?
in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture . "
a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?
and how can they handle this enormous task at a time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs ?
are these issues better tackled through traditional or digital means ?
the prevailing consensus at the congress : neither the pixel nor the printed word will prevail , but the problems are best solved by a mixture of both .
" the library of the future will be a hybrid , " says library director georg ruppelt .
" the hybrid library allows electronic access to everything possible , but printed books will remain . "
thus , digital and analog will coexist peacefully side-by-side .
mirroring this statement , jürgen seefeldt and ludger syre submitted a paper describing the library of 2015 .
according to them , the initial experience with digital technology has failed to entirely displace the book and that will continue to be the case .
it seems that no one really wants to read earnestly for long periods of time in an electronic library .
a strategic alliance librarians hope to maximize the advantages of both traditional books and technology in a strategic alliance .
instead of an unwieldy card catalog , they foresee efficient networked databases , with access to the reserves of libraries around the world .
yet the old-school stacks will remain , including the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book " and all the other tactile elements .
ideally , both will be stored in an aesthetically pleasing space - a library that can serve as a social meeting place .
so , at the world library and information congress at least , the battle between the printed word and the pixel has been resolved through a peaceful co-existence , with each medium retained to suit its ideal purpose .
traditional bibliophiles can keep their books and techno-fans can have their pixels .
and maybe that 's the way it will go in the consumer market .
even john updike has licensed his upcoming book for digital distribution , a nod to those who would rather read on their lap-top . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de acid to acid , dust to dust in the labyrinth-like archives of the country 's libraries , millions of books are slowly crumbling to dust .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.08.2003 turkey pushes forward on eu reform course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demands for change are growing , especially among turkey 's kurdish minority .
in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership . turkish president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday approved an amnesty law for kurdish rebels once engaged in a vicious war in the south-east of the country .
the law , adopted by parliament last week , offers a pardon for kurdish rebels who lay down their arms and surrender and who have not committed any violent crimes .
it also envisages reducing the jail sentences of those already imprisoned for violent acts , if they provide the authorities with information about their underground activities .
the amnesty , mainly aimed at rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- - now renamed kadek - will be valid for six months .
the kurdish rebels have fought a bloody separatist war in the country ’ s mainly kurdish south-east since 1984 , claiming the lives of more than 36,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan .
though kadek announced a cease-fire in 1999 following the capture of leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- , some 5,000 rebels are believed to be still holed up in mountainous bases in northern iraq .
ankara believes that around 2,000 rebels can qualify for the amnesty .
however , senior leaders and commanders of kadek have been excluded from it .
the amnesty is seen by some observers as an attempt by turkey to improve on its woeful record of human-rights record . of particular concern for the eu has been the rampant use of torture in prisons and police stations .
weakening the grip of the mighty military the amnesty law comes close on the heels of another landmark package of reforms passed by the turkish parliament last week . the new laws drastically curtail the power of the country ’ s powerful army generals , the self-proclaimed guardians of turkey ’ s secular constitution and long considered a potent force in turkish politics .
the measures aim to curb the political influence of the military , strips the military-dominated national security council -lrb- mgk -rrb- of its executive powers and turns it into a advisory body .
it also abolishes some anti-terror laws thought to crush freedom of thought and expression .
" this law is a step for democracy and freedom .
our aim is to reach the standards of countries already enjoying first class rights and freedoms , " turkish justice minister cemil cicek told parliament after the vote .
on monday , turkey 's military proved they would allow the reforms when they appointed an army general as secretary-general of the mgk , a move observors say will sharply reduce the power of the general as compared to his predecessors .
" the fact that a four-star general will be heading the secretariat does n't really mean that the military will be as instrumental as they were in the past .
the functions are no longer there , " sedat ergin , ankara bureau chief for turkey 's daily hurriyet told reuters .
all for the sake of eu membership the latest measures are all part of turkey ’ s attempt to convince brussels of its commitment to a reformist agenda and fall into the seventh of a series of so-called " harmonization packages " that would bring turkey into line with its would-be eu partners and eventually qualify it for membership of the european union .
brussels says it will not hold accession talks with turkey - the only eu candidate country with a predominantly muslim population - unless it first implements a wide-ranging series of measures that would meet eu criteria setting standards for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which every eu candidate must fulfill .
for ankara , this means nothing short of revamping its much of system of governance , which is considered riddled by corruption , poor on human rights and largely controlled by the fiercely secular army generals who are wary of both muslim fundamentalism and kurdish separatism .
road to eu club remains rocky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan though previous governments began tackling the formidable task by pushing through past eu harmonization bills , the present ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- has stepped up the pace of reforms by bolstering rights and freedoms for the country ’ s estimated 12 million-strong kurdish minority .
however major challenges remain in the form of an uneasy relationship between the powerful military and the akp .
the secular-minded army generals - who forced an islamist government out of office in 1997 - remain suspicious of the akp ’ s islamist roots , though its leaders have disavowed them and have promised to support democratic reform and keep religion out of politics .
the generals are also jittery that the emergence of a kurdish quasi-state next door in iraq might stir aspirations among turkey ’ s kurdish minority population of greater freedom and might be reinforced by the eu ’ s insistence on minority rights .
turkey ’ s goal of eu membership remains further complicated , this time by a debate outside its borders , with some eu officials saying turkey with its predominantly muslim population should not become a member because its cultural identity and history are not european enough .
for now however the eu has welcomed turkey ’ s latest measures to help smooth its path into the club .
cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , told reuters , " our reaction is very positive .
of course we all want to look at the small print and the implementation , but this goes exactly in the direction of fulfilling the copenhagen criteria . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey takes the cultural route to the eu turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations .

in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership . turkish president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday approved an amnesty law for kurdish rebels once engaged in a vicious war in the south-east of the country .
the law , adopted by parliament last week , offers a pardon for kurdish rebels who lay down their arms and surrender and who have not committed any violent crimes .
it also envisages reducing the jail sentences of those already imprisoned for violent acts , if they provide the authorities with information about their underground activities .
the amnesty , mainly aimed at rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- - now renamed kadek - will be valid for six months .
the kurdish rebels have fought a bloody separatist war in the country ’ s mainly kurdish south-east since 1984 , claiming the lives of more than 36,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan .
though kadek announced a cease-fire in 1999 following the capture of leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- , some 5,000 rebels are believed to be still holed up in mountainous bases in northern iraq .
ankara believes that around 2,000 rebels can qualify for the amnesty .
however , senior leaders and commanders of kadek have been excluded from it .
the amnesty is seen by some observers as an attempt by turkey to improve on its woeful record of human-rights record . of particular concern for the eu has been the rampant use of torture in prisons and police stations .
weakening the grip of the mighty military the amnesty law comes close on the heels of another landmark package of reforms passed by the turkish parliament last week . the new laws drastically curtail the power of the country ’ s powerful army generals , the self-proclaimed guardians of turkey ’ s secular constitution and long considered a potent force in turkish politics .
the measures aim to curb the political influence of the military , strips the military-dominated national security council -lrb- mgk -rrb- of its executive powers and turns it into a advisory body .
it also abolishes some anti-terror laws thought to crush freedom of thought and expression .
" this law is a step for democracy and freedom .
our aim is to reach the standards of countries already enjoying first class rights and freedoms , " turkish justice minister cemil cicek told parliament after the vote .
on monday , turkey 's military proved they would allow the reforms when they appointed an army general as secretary-general of the mgk , a move observors say will sharply reduce the power of the general as compared to his predecessors .
" the fact that a four-star general will be heading the secretariat does n't really mean that the military will be as instrumental as they were in the past .
the functions are no longer there , " sedat ergin , ankara bureau chief for turkey 's daily hurriyet told reuters .
all for the sake of eu membership the latest measures are all part of turkey ’ s attempt to convince brussels of its commitment to a reformist agenda and fall into the seventh of a series of so-called " harmonization packages " that would bring turkey into line with its would-be eu partners and eventually qualify it for membership of the european union .
brussels says it will not hold accession talks with turkey - the only eu candidate country with a predominantly muslim population - unless it first implements a wide-ranging series of measures that would meet eu criteria setting standards for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which every eu candidate must fulfill .
for ankara , this means nothing short of revamping its much of system of governance , which is considered riddled by corruption , poor on human rights and largely controlled by the fiercely secular army generals who are wary of both muslim fundamentalism and kurdish separatism .
road to eu club remains rocky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan though previous governments began tackling the formidable task by pushing through past eu harmonization bills , the present ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- has stepped up the pace of reforms by bolstering rights and freedoms for the country ’ s estimated 12 million-strong kurdish minority .
however major challenges remain in the form of an uneasy relationship between the powerful military and the akp .
the secular-minded army generals - who forced an islamist government out of office in 1997 - remain suspicious of the akp ’ s islamist roots , though its leaders have disavowed them and have promised to support democratic reform and keep religion out of politics .
the generals are also jittery that the emergence of a kurdish quasi-state next door in iraq might stir aspirations among turkey ’ s kurdish minority population of greater freedom and might be reinforced by the eu ’ s insistence on minority rights .
turkey ’ s goal of eu membership remains further complicated , this time by a debate outside its borders , with some eu officials saying turkey with its predominantly muslim population should not become a member because its cultural identity and history are not european enough .
for now however the eu has welcomed turkey ’ s latest measures to help smooth its path into the club .
cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , told reuters , " our reaction is very positive .
of course we all want to look at the small print and the implementation , but this goes exactly in the direction of fulfilling the copenhagen criteria . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey takes the cultural route to the eu turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations .

in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture . "
a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?
and how can they handle this enormous task at a time of shrinking budgets and increasing costs ?
are these issues better tackled through traditional or digital means ?
the prevailing consensus at the congress : neither the pixel nor the printed word will prevail , but the problems are best solved by a mixture of both .
" the library of the future will be a hybrid , " says library director georg ruppelt .
" the hybrid library allows electronic access to everything possible , but printed books will remain . "
thus , digital and analog will coexist peacefully side-by-side .
mirroring this statement , jürgen seefeldt and ludger syre submitted a paper describing the library of 2015 .
according to them , the initial experience with digital technology has failed to entirely displace the book and that will continue to be the case .
it seems that no one really wants to read earnestly for long periods of time in an electronic library .
a strategic alliance librarians hope to maximize the advantages of both traditional books and technology in a strategic alliance .
instead of an unwieldy card catalog , they foresee efficient networked databases , with access to the reserves of libraries around the world .
yet the old-school stacks will remain , including the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book " and all the other tactile elements .
ideally , both will be stored in an aesthetically pleasing space - a library that can serve as a social meeting place .
so , at the world library and information congress at least , the battle between the printed word and the pixel has been resolved through a peaceful co-existence , with each medium retained to suit its ideal purpose .

in an age of digital euphoria , will good old-fashioned books become relics of the past ?
and what will the library of the future look like ?
librarians are debating these questions and more at a conference in berlin . as digital information mediums like microsoft reader become ever more popular , many fear that digital technology will soon send traditional books - something you can hold in your hand , touch , feel , and smell - the way of the dodo bird .
in a newspaper article published in the summer of 2000 , the american novelist john updike lamented the potential loss , proclaiming that he 'd choose a dull , half-heartedly produced book over a droning laptop any day .
describing the " seductive caress of a book in one 's hand " and the " smell of the first few chapters of a new book . "
updike warned " without books , we will become nothing more than a system of electronic impulses . "
the " death of books " vs. a networked library at the turn of the century , updike added his name to the canon of cultural critics who fear the loss of the book .
ever since the media critic marshall mcluhan predicted back in 1965 that the end of the gutenberg era was near , and that the printed word would soon be displaced by the pixel and digital screen , the number of book preservationists has grown .
others , namely the digital enthusiasts , praise the advantages of technology over bound books and dream of a networked " world library , " where information is just a click away .
will those with the power to choose the path of the future - the fate of the book and the shape of tomorrow 's library - heed updike 's warning or forge ahead into a perceived digital information utopia ?
the choice between these two extremes is the subject of a debate at this year 's world library and information congress -lrb- held in berlin from august 1 to 9 -rrb- , where more than 4,000 librarians from 125 countries are planning the library of 2015 under the banner " access point library : media-information-culture .

a hybrid for the future how can libraries store and manage ever growing volumes of information ?

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.08.2003 makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former thorn in the side becomes a rose in the bayern garden bayern munich pulled out all the stops to secure the signing of dutch international striker roy makaay in an attempt to mount a more serious assault on the european champions league this season . it ’ s a well known fact that german soccer clubs have been experiencing financial woes in the wake of the television rights crisis that has plagued the bundesliga for the past two seasons .
as if to emphasis the point further , the summer transfer market in germany was relatively quiet with the big clubs seemingly satisfied with their current squads as the season came closer to kick off .
even the champions were spending thriftily on the eve of their title defense .
that is until this week when bayern munich revealed on monday that dutch striker roy makaay would be joining them from deportivo la coruna in spain for an undisclosed sum .
the fee is rumored to be somewhere between deportivo ’ s estimated € 20 million -lrb- $ 22.61million -rrb- price tag and bayern ’ s offer of € 16 million , with some voices whispering that it could be the second most expensive in the league ’ s 40-year history .
the 28-year-old could start repaying that financial layout when he makes his debut in the bundesliga game at hanover 96 on saturday , august 9 .
euro hopes boosted by arrival makaay , who won the golden boot award for europe 's top scorer last season , after netting 29 goals in 38 league matches for deportivo , joins the bavarian giants in a four-year deal as they prepare to defend their standing as number one in the bundesliga and steel themselves for another assault on the european champions league .
after the disappointment of last season ’ s short-lived european adventure , makaay ’ s arrival is expected to strengthen the team as bayern goes up against the likes of real madrid , juventus turin and manchester united .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern will be hoping for a better european challenge this year .
the irony will not be lost on the many bayern fans who have enthusiastically welcomed makaay to the club .
makaay was instrumental in setting the wreaking ball in motion on bayern ’ s ill-fated and disastrous foray into last season ’ s champions league campaign .
as the main danger man for deportivo , makaay scored three times in the olympic stadium as bayern opened their campaign with a 3-2 defeat to the primera league team and consequently failed in their attempt to reach the second phase of the competition .
deal completed in nick of time makaay will now be eligible for bayern ’ s champions league games as the deal went through before deportivo played in the third qualifying round of the tournament which takes place on august 13 .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said earlier in the week that if deportivo registered makaay for the champions league , the transfer would have been called off ; such is the club ’ s desire to build their european campaign around him .

" such a player would be an enrichment for bayern and the entire bundesliga .

as if to emphasis the point further , the summer transfer market in germany was relatively quiet with the big clubs seemingly satisfied with their current squads as the season came closer to kick off .
even the champions were spending thriftily on the eve of their title defense .
that is until this week when bayern munich revealed on monday that dutch striker roy makaay would be joining them from deportivo la coruna in spain for an undisclosed sum .
the fee is rumored to be somewhere between deportivo ’ s estimated € 20 million -lrb- $ 22.61million -rrb- price tag and bayern ’ s offer of € 16 million , with some voices whispering that it could be the second most expensive in the league ’ s 40-year history .
the 28-year-old could start repaying that financial layout when he makes his debut in the bundesliga game at hanover 96 on saturday , august 9 .
euro hopes boosted by arrival makaay , who won the golden boot award for europe 's top scorer last season , after netting 29 goals in 38 league matches for deportivo , joins the bavarian giants in a four-year deal as they prepare to defend their standing as number one in the bundesliga and steel themselves for another assault on the european champions league .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern will be hoping for a better european challenge this year .
the irony will not be lost on the many bayern fans who have enthusiastically welcomed makaay to the club .
makaay was instrumental in setting the wreaking ball in motion on bayern ’ s ill-fated and disastrous foray into last season ’ s champions league campaign .
as the main danger man for deportivo , makaay scored three times in the olympic stadium as bayern opened their campaign with a 3-2 defeat to the primera league team and consequently failed in their attempt to reach the second phase of the competition .
deal completed in nick of time makaay will now be eligible for bayern ’ s champions league games as the deal went through before deportivo played in the third qualifying round of the tournament which takes place on august 13 .
bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said earlier in the week that if deportivo registered makaay for the champions league , the transfer would have been called off ; such is the club ’ s desire to build their european campaign around him .
makaay ’ s arrival will also spark a competition for places in the team as the current first choice striking duo is made up of giovanni elber and claudio pizzaro .
but as the club 's supervisory board chairman franz beckenbauer said on monday , " i am certain that we need a third top striker alongside elber and pizarro for a long season . "
beckenbauer wields his influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer rates makaay highly .
beckenbauer was personally involved in persuading commercial manager uli hoeness to pursue makaay , saying during the transfer negotiations that the club should meet deportivo ’ s conditions if they wanted to capture the dutchman ’ s signature .

haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .
the long protective market will now experience measured influence from foreign investors via saban .
" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .

his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .

the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .

german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .
but saban had other ideas and bauer was elbowed aside , leaving the american to sign a deal in march .

haim saban , an egyptian-born american billionaire , has bought the controlling stake private german broadcaster prosiebensat.1.
the deal makes good on his first failed attempt to buy up leo kirch 's bankrupt media empire . it took him a while , but haim saban is finally where he wants to be : in prime position to tap into the german and european media markets .
with the purchase of prosiebensat.1 , a process that has been ongoing for more than five months , saban immediately controls half of the private television market in germany .
he also becomes the first official heir to the empire of german media giant leo kirch , who stood by helplessly as his media empire - to which prosieben belonged - slowly began to crumble a year and a half ago .
the purchase by the egyptian-born , u.s.-made multimillionaire marks the beginning of a new era in german television .
the long protective market will now experience measured influence from foreign investors via saban .
" we 're very pleased that our offer has won the support of the creditor committee , " saban said in a statement .
" we look forward to completing the transaction . "
his purchase of the embattled broadcaster , which has suffered under the uncertainties of the kirch bankruptcy , is already being seen as a necessary boost in troubled times for the market .

the deal values prosieben at € 1.3 billion .
but his takeover almost floundered for a second time when private equity firm apax partners filed an 11th-hour bid worth € 8 per ordinary share on tuesday just before the creditors ' meeting started .
the attempted hijacking of the deal fell through when apax 's partner , the carlyle group , dropped out leaving the road clear for saban .

german publisher heinrich bauer was the first to show an interest after teaming up with german bank hvb group and a deal was struck for prosieben eight months ago .
but saban had other ideas and bauer was elbowed aside , leaving the american to sign a deal in march .
however , that attempt failed in june after saban had problems with financing .
his determination to get into the german market , however , never waivered .
" i would have tried -lrb- to buy prosieben -rrb- ten times if i had failed nine times , " saban said according to the german news agency dpa .

germany ’ s interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has reportedly come under fire from european commission president romano prodi , who has threatened legal action if the mess is not sorted out quickly . the on-going saga that is germany ’ s can and bottle deposit system took another embarrassing turn on wednesday when the president of the european commission , romano prodi , reportedly called on gerhard schröder ’ s government to sort out the messy situation . an article published in the mass circulation tabloid bild reported that prodi had issued an ultimatum to the german chancellor to bring the chaos to an end .
in a letter to schröder , prodi threatened germany with a “ contractual violation procedure ” should the planned october 1 launch of the permanent network of deposit machines not come into existence .
the ec president also demanded that the current compulsory deposit on single-use packaging be suspended until the final system is up and running . a government spokesman on wednesday said the letter bild referred to was had been sent to berlin last month .
" we 're on the same page as brussels , " said the spokesman .
" an extension of the temporary rules is out of the question . " it is not the first time the ec has spoken out about the situation in germany regarding the deposit system but the severity of the tone and the personal intervention of romano prodi take the disagreement to a more serious level . ec claimed system unfair to foreign businesses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frederik -lrb- frits -rrb- bolkestein .
in july , the european commission claimed that the interim arrangement for handling the deposit , which came into force at the start of the year , could conflict with eu laws on free movement of goods .
claiming that the system had drastically reduced sales of beverages in recyclable containers , ec internal market commissioner frits bolkestein said at the time that he believed the present system in germany put foreign filling companies at a disadvantage .
germany ’ s environment ministry spokesman michael schrören defended the system in a statement : “ there are no signs that imported products are disadvantaged by the current interim deposit rule .
on the contrary , 15 percent more foreign mineral water than before has been sold since the introduction of the deposit . ”
german environment minister jürgen trittin also sent a letter to the ec asking for proof that french mineral water suppliers had seen lower export sales due to the deposit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin however , despite the exchange of words , trittin told the german news agency dpa soon after : “ there is no conflict between the federal government and the eu commission . ” the eu threatened to take legal action against germany as recently as last month but then changed its mind , demanding only that the system due to be introduced in october be replaced by an eu approved alternative . plagued with problems at home on a national level , the nationwide interim deposit system for cans and plastic bottles has been plagued by problems since its introduction in january but none has been more damaging than the german beverage industry ’ s decision to suspend the expensive operation in july .
the industry claimed that there wasn ’ t a proper legal framework to justify the investment of billions of euros , which caused an angry response from trittin who told the industry that it must stand by its promise to adhere to the recycling law . speaking at the time of the decision , peter traumann , chairman of the german food industry association , said in a statement , “ in our estimation , over the past five months the mandatory deposit on single-use drink containers has caused dramatic market distortions leading to existential dangers for firms and jobs .
we ’ re afraid this trend will continue if conditions don ’ t change . ” plan to simplify recycling backfires bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good idea badly managed ?
the deposit system or “ dosenpfand ” was supposed to simplify the recycling of non-refillable containers by charging consumers a 25-cent -lrb- 29 u.s. cents -rrb- deposit on almost all single-use cans and bottles , encouraging them to return the empties to the place of purchase in order to get their money back . government hopes that the system would increase recycling have been dashed by complaints from the business community and consumers who say the scheme is inconvenient and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . the interim deposit system was expected to be replaced on october 1 by the permanent network of collection machines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.08.2003 turkey pushes forward on eu reform course großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demands for change are growing , especially among turkey 's kurdish minority .
in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership . turkish president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday approved an amnesty law for kurdish rebels once engaged in a vicious war in the south-east of the country .
the law , adopted by parliament last week , offers a pardon for kurdish rebels who lay down their arms and surrender and who have not committed any violent crimes .
it also envisages reducing the jail sentences of those already imprisoned for violent acts , if they provide the authorities with information about their underground activities .
the amnesty , mainly aimed at rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- - now renamed kadek - will be valid for six months .
the kurdish rebels have fought a bloody separatist war in the country ’ s mainly kurdish south-east since 1984 , claiming the lives of more than 36,000 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan .
though kadek announced a cease-fire in 1999 following the capture of leader abdullah ocalan -lrb- photo -rrb- , some 5,000 rebels are believed to be still holed up in mountainous bases in northern iraq .
ankara believes that around 2,000 rebels can qualify for the amnesty .
however , senior leaders and commanders of kadek have been excluded from it .
the amnesty is seen by some observers as an attempt by turkey to improve on its woeful record of human-rights record . of particular concern for the eu has been the rampant use of torture in prisons and police stations .
weakening the grip of the mighty military the amnesty law comes close on the heels of another landmark package of reforms passed by the turkish parliament last week . the new laws drastically curtail the power of the country ’ s powerful army generals , the self-proclaimed guardians of turkey ’ s secular constitution and long considered a potent force in turkish politics .
the measures aim to curb the political influence of the military , strips the military-dominated national security council -lrb- mgk -rrb- of its executive powers and turns it into a advisory body .
it also abolishes some anti-terror laws thought to crush freedom of thought and expression .
" this law is a step for democracy and freedom .
our aim is to reach the standards of countries already enjoying first class rights and freedoms , " turkish justice minister cemil cicek told parliament after the vote .
on monday , turkey 's military proved they would allow the reforms when they appointed an army general as secretary-general of the mgk , a move observors say will sharply reduce the power of the general as compared to his predecessors .
" the fact that a four-star general will be heading the secretariat does n't really mean that the military will be as instrumental as they were in the past .
the functions are no longer there , " sedat ergin , ankara bureau chief for turkey 's daily hurriyet told reuters .
all for the sake of eu membership the latest measures are all part of turkey ’ s attempt to convince brussels of its commitment to a reformist agenda and fall into the seventh of a series of so-called " harmonization packages " that would bring turkey into line with its would-be eu partners and eventually qualify it for membership of the european union .
brussels says it will not hold accession talks with turkey - the only eu candidate country with a predominantly muslim population - unless it first implements a wide-ranging series of measures that would meet eu criteria setting standards for democracy , human rights and the rule of law , which every eu candidate must fulfill .
for ankara , this means nothing short of revamping its much of system of governance , which is considered riddled by corruption , poor on human rights and largely controlled by the fiercely secular army generals who are wary of both muslim fundamentalism and kurdish separatism .
road to eu club remains rocky bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recep tayyip erdogan though previous governments began tackling the formidable task by pushing through past eu harmonization bills , the present ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- led by tayyip erdogan -lrb- photo -rrb- has stepped up the pace of reforms by bolstering rights and freedoms for the country ’ s estimated 12 million-strong kurdish minority .
however major challenges remain in the form of an uneasy relationship between the powerful military and the akp .
the secular-minded army generals - who forced an islamist government out of office in 1997 - remain suspicious of the akp ’ s islamist roots , though its leaders have disavowed them and have promised to support democratic reform and keep religion out of politics .
the generals are also jittery that the emergence of a kurdish quasi-state next door in iraq might stir aspirations among turkey ’ s kurdish minority population of greater freedom and might be reinforced by the eu ’ s insistence on minority rights .
turkey ’ s goal of eu membership remains further complicated , this time by a debate outside its borders , with some eu officials saying turkey with its predominantly muslim population should not become a member because its cultural identity and history are not european enough .
for now however the eu has welcomed turkey ’ s latest measures to help smooth its path into the club .
cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , told reuters , " our reaction is very positive .
of course we all want to look at the small print and the implementation , but this goes exactly in the direction of fulfilling the copenhagen criteria . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey takes the cultural route to the eu turkey may have a long way to go politically before it is accepted in the eu , but the mainly muslim nation is making strong cultural inroads into europe , making it difficult for brussels to ignore its eu aspirations .

the airline - which has historically been among the more successful in a fragile industry - said it lost hk $ 1.24bn -lrb- us $ 159m ; £ 99m -rrb- after taxes in the first half of 2003 , having turned a $ 1.41bn profit in the same period the year before .
the loss was the result of a slide in sales of more than a fifth despite a strong start to the year , as both business and holiday travellers ditched plans to fly in or to asia , for fear of the virus .
airlines across the region slashed flights , grounded planes and planned sweeping staff cuts in response .
in the past week alone singapore airlines , japan airlines system and all nippon airways have all reported losses as well , while the total for airlines worldwide is estimated by the international air transportation association to be $ 6.5bn.
" this was without a doubt the most challenging period in cathay pacific 's history , " said the airline 's chairman , james hughes-hallett .
cathay 's shares dipped about 2 % to hk $ 10.80 on the announcement .
the virus saw them fall 30 % in less than a month earlier this year fom hk $ 11.85 to hk $ 8.40 , although they have since recovered most of the ground .
drastic measures cathay 's problems with sars were two-fold : it was one of those worst affected by the disease , and it also suffered a backlash from the refusal by the government on the chinese mainland - and of hong kong itself - to admit the real scale of the problem .
the disease claimed 297 lives in hong kong from some 1,800 infections , putting it in second spot after china 's 348 fatalities out of more than 5,200 sufferers .
the effect was to slash travel within the region by a third , cathay said in april .
at one point , internal memos warned that the fleet might have to be grounded altogether .

malcolm chisholm told labour msp duncan mcneil that he would listen to the arguments put forward by campaigners .
mr mcneil , who represents the greenock and inverclyde , is among those fighting the proposals which were approved by the area 's nhs board last month .
the royal alexandra hospital in paisley will be left as the only consultant-led unit in the area , serving mothers-to-be from as far afield as the kyle of bute and north ayrshire .
the rankin unit at greenock 's inverclyde royal hospital - which currently provides a full service - will be left with a midwife-led service .
two hospitals opponents fear this will lead to the loss of further services at the hospital .
mr mcneil also believes it could result in the centralisation of consultant-led inpatient services for more than 800,000 women and children in two hospitals just seven miles apart .
speaking after a meeting with mr chisholm , he said : " i am somewhat heartened by the minister 's assurance that he will not rush into rubber stamping this decision , but will examine carefully the points which we have been advancing .
there is no excuse for not fighting on duncan mcneil msp " he certainly seems more than happy to listen to our arguments . "
he said mr chisholm would be under " immense pressure " to back the board 's decision .
" but our arguments are strong and the minister has shown a willingness to listen to them , so there is no excuse for not fighting on , " said mr mcneil .
the proposals have been defended by the board , which said it was addressing fears that safety could be compromised for women and their babies .
the reasons behind the shake-up included a falling birth rate and difficulties in recruiting and training junior doctors .
well received the board also said that the impact on other services would be addressed as part of a wider review of health care services .
mr mcneil is also seeking a parliamentary inquiry into the issue of centralisation in the nhs .
the msp said his request had been " fairly well received " by his colleagues on holyrood 's health committee .
" no decision on the committee 's work programme for the coming session will be taken until the end of this month and i will actively continue to work to build cross party support for such an inquiry , " he said .

fears are growing that bombardier shorts will press ahead with job cuts after the negotiations broke down on tuesday .
more than 1,000 jobs are under threat at the company after 60 % of workers voted in may to reject a proposed four-year agreement over pay .
negotiations were to continue on wednesday , but union leaders said they had failed to resolve two issues that were in dispute at preliminary talks over the weekend .
they accused the company of undermining the talks through their " inflexible position " .
a shorts spokesman said they were " disappointed " the unions had chosen to walk out and said the company was fully committed to finding a solution .
they were n't prepared to take these preconditions off the table so we had no option but to walk out peter williamson union official the company has already announced 580 redundancies in response to what it called " very challenging market conditions " .
tuesday 's walkout marked a change in relations between the parties , as both bombardier aerospace and a union source described talks held last wednesday as " constructive " .
peter williamson from the manufacturing , science and finance union amicus , who is leading the union 's delegation in the talks , said on tuesday that they were forced to walk out because management refused to withdraw two preconditions .
management stood firm on the uptake of apprenticeships and the payment of holiday entitlements .
" clearly the company were not prepared to enter into constructive negotiations , " he said .
" they were n't prepared to take these preconditions off the table so we had no option but to walk out .
our priority has always been , and still remains , our employees , and the long-term future of the company bombardier spokeswoman " all management need to do is to give us dates when the apprentice issue will be dealt with and when the outstanding money will be paid and we will re-enter talks .
a spokeswoman for bombardier said the issues of apprentice intake and holiday entitlement were only tabled by the union delegation at preliminary talks last week .
" we have consistently and repeatedly expressed our willingness and desire to reach an agreement , and totally refute any claims calling that commitment into question , " she said " our priority has always been , and still remains , our employees , and the long-term future of the company . "
bombardier in canada has already made it clear that it needs to reduce the workforce in northern ireland in order to improve competitiveness .
it said it was essential that the company was " in the best position possible to retain contracts with its customers who are demanding very competitive , long-term price commitments " .
the aerospace industry has been badly affected in recent years by events including 11 september , the consequent fear of terrorism , the downturn in the global economy , competition from low-cost carriers and the recent sars outbreak .
many airlines are in financial difficulties and have cancelled some aircraft orders and putting others on hold .

fears are growing that bombardier shorts will press ahead with job cuts after the negotiations broke down on tuesday .
more than 1,000 jobs are under threat at the company after 60 % of workers voted in may to reject a proposed four-year agreement over pay .
negotiations were to continue on wednesday , but union leaders said they had failed to resolve two issues that were in dispute at preliminary talks over the weekend .
they accused the company of undermining the talks through their " inflexible position " .
a shorts spokesman said they were " disappointed " the unions had chosen to walk out and said the company was fully committed to finding a solution .
they were n't prepared to take these preconditions off the table so we had no option but to walk out peter williamson union official the company has already announced 580 redundancies in response to what it called " very challenging market conditions " .
tuesday 's walkout marked a change in relations between the parties , as both bombardier aerospace and a union source described talks held last wednesday as " constructive " .
peter williamson from the manufacturing , science and finance union amicus , who is leading the union 's delegation in the talks , said on tuesday that they were forced to walk out because management refused to withdraw two preconditions .
management stood firm on the uptake of apprenticeships and the payment of holiday entitlements .
" clearly the company were not prepared to enter into constructive negotiations , " he said .
" they were n't prepared to take these preconditions off the table so we had no option but to walk out .
our priority has always been , and still remains , our employees , and the long-term future of the company bombardier spokeswoman " all management need to do is to give us dates when the apprentice issue will be dealt with and when the outstanding money will be paid and we will re-enter talks .
a spokeswoman for bombardier said the issues of apprentice intake and holiday entitlement were only tabled by the union delegation at preliminary talks last week .
" we have consistently and repeatedly expressed our willingness and desire to reach an agreement , and totally refute any claims calling that commitment into question , " she said " our priority has always been , and still remains , our employees , and the long-term future of the company . "
bombardier in canada has already made it clear that it needs to reduce the workforce in northern ireland in order to improve competitiveness .
it said it was essential that the company was " in the best position possible to retain contracts with its customers who are demanding very competitive , long-term price commitments " .
the aerospace industry has been badly affected in recent years by events including 11 september , the consequent fear of terrorism , the downturn in the global economy , competition from low-cost carriers and the recent sars outbreak .
many airlines are in financial difficulties and have cancelled some aircraft orders and putting others on hold .

residents of three communities on cape york , in the northern state of queensland , said their lives had been transformed by the new measures .
violence has fallen , and the number of children attending school has risen since the restrictions were introduced .
some communities have chosen to " go dry " , imposing a total ban on alcohol , while others have restricted hotel hours and banned takeaway sales .
mr howard applauded the community discipline that has forced through the changes , saying that people were being given the chance to avoid the destructive menace of alcohol abuse .
alcohol abuse blights native settlements across australia , and is a factor in spiralling rates of domestic violence , unemployment and ill-health .
but despite the improvements , locals told mr howard that there were still many problems yet to be faced .
a young aboriginal woman told mr howard how murder , rape and assault had ruined the lives of many of her schoolmates .
tania major , 22 , said that seven of her 14 former classmates were now in jail , four had committed suicide and almost all were alcoholics .
" we have spent so long listening to some ' white fellas ' telling us we are stupid , lazy no-hopers that the majority of my people actually believe it , " she said .
policy priority this is one of mr howard 's most significant visits to an aboriginal settlement , according to the bbc correspondent in sydney , phil mercer .
in recent years , the prime minister has angered aborigines by his refusal to offer an official apology for the government 's policy last century of forcing indigenous children away from their parents to be raised in white society .
but the government has now made the disadvantages suffered by native australians a policy priority , and last month mr howard hosted an emergency summit on domestic violence .
the new restrictions have made a difference , but only to a small number of communities , our correspondent says .
aborigines remain the nation 's most disadvantaged group , dying 20 years younger than other australians - with far higher rates of imprisonment , unemployment and welfare dependency .

in recent years , the prime minister has angered aborigines by his refusal to offer an official apology for the government 's policy last century of forcing indigenous children away from their parents to be raised in white society .
but the government has now made the disadvantages suffered by native australians a policy priority , and last month mr howard hosted an emergency summit on domestic violence .
the new restrictions have made a difference , but only to a small number of communities , our correspondent says .
aborigines remain the nation 's most disadvantaged group , dying 20 years younger than other australians - with far higher rates of imprisonment , unemployment and welfare dependency .

residents of three communities on cape york , in the northern state of queensland , said their lives had been transformed by the new measures .
violence has fallen , and the number of children attending school has risen since the restrictions were introduced .
some communities have chosen to " go dry " , imposing a total ban on alcohol , while others have restricted hotel hours and banned takeaway sales .
mr howard applauded the community discipline that has forced through the changes , saying that people were being given the chance to avoid the destructive menace of alcohol abuse .
alcohol abuse blights native settlements across australia , and is a factor in spiralling rates of domestic violence , unemployment and ill-health .
but despite the improvements , locals told mr howard that there were still many problems yet to be faced .
a young aboriginal woman told mr howard how murder , rape and assault had ruined the lives of many of her schoolmates .
tania major , 22 , said that seven of her 14 former classmates were now in jail , four had committed suicide and almost all were alcoholics .
" we have spent so long listening to some ' white fellas ' telling us we are stupid , lazy no-hopers that the majority of my people actually believe it , " she said .

a new initiative called quiet lanes is being introduced in the village of youlgreave to try to encourage drivers to slow down .
villagers are worried speeding vehicles both damage the environment and pose a safety risk .
so far the scheme is limited to signs but the authorities say there are many more things that can be done to slow traffic down .
effective network peter stubbs from the peak district national park said : " it is n't just about signing , its about the treatment of the road as well .
" in an ideal world there would be all sorts of treatment to emphasise this is a relatively little used , rural road .
" for example there could be false cattle grids painted on the road , there could be local narrowings of the road so people have to give way .
" i have seen some examples in other parts of the country where they deliberately allow a strip of grass to grow down the middle so it looks like a little track . "
he added : " this is not about forcing drivers off the roads but more about moderating and altering their behaviour and attitude . "
villagers hope the scheme can grow into a more effective network where drivers are made aware of the residents ' needs .

the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams , who is considered a liberal , said the election of reverend gene robinson as the next bishop of new hampshire would have a significant impact on the church worldwide .
robinson was elected by 62 votes to 45 by bishops of the episcopal church - the us branch of the 80-million strong global anglican communion .
traditionalist anglicans have condemned mr robinson 's appointment , which threatens to cause a split in church ranks .
see a map of anglican communities around the world senior clerics abroad have expressed great distress and there are plans for emergency meetings to discuss what action to take .
split threat in a statement in london , archbishop williams acknowledged mr robinson 's appointment would have a " significant impact " on the church worldwide but said it was " too early to say " what the outcome would be .
' proud to make history ' have your say : bishop row " we need as a church to be very careful about making decisions for our own part of the world which constrain the church elsewhere , " he said .
the bbc 's jane little in minneapolis , where the vote took place , says archbishop williams is now in a very difficult position as he tries to prevent a schism .
conservatives say mr robinson 's election has already shattered the church , and they are planning a meeting of like-minded anglicans , including archbishops from the developing world , to plot a possible future outside the american church , our correspondent reports .
appointment denounced mr robinson was confirmed in his new post hours after he was cleared of sexual misconduct allegations .
anglicans in america there are two million baptised episcopalians the anglican church has 80m members worldwide america has 236m christians episcopal church spokesman daniel england called the vote " an important step " , but bishop robert duncan of pittsburgh , who had campaigned against mr robinson , said he and other bishops were " filled with sorrow " .
he said the episcopal church had " divided itself from millions of anglicans throughout the world " .
fiercest criticism came from the american anglican council , a conservative episcopal group , which said the episcopal church had " departed from the historical christian faith .
we reject these actions of our church " .
the vote was also deplored among sections of the anglican community worldwide , with church leaders in asia denouncing the appointment of a homosexual bishop as contrary to the teachings of the bible .
earlier this year , bishops in africa , asia and latin america - representing a third of anglicans worldwide - severed ties with a canadian diocese which authorised same-sex blessings .
