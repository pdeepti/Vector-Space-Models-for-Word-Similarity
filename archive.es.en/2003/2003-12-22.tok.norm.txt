casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .
that led to the firms founder and chairman calisto tanzi to surprisingly hand over control to enrico bondi , a man with a reputation for turning around troubled businesses . bondi is now likely to file for protection from creditors as he tries to get the company 's books in order .
according to the reuters news agency , bondi was to meet with italian industry minister antonio marzano to discuss how to proceed . italian prosecutors are now also involved to determine the extent of criminal activity such as fraud .
along with the company ’ s auditors , grant thornton and deloitte & touche , ex-finance director fausto tonna will come in for considerable scrutiny . some italian newspapers had reported that tonna had fled to venezuela , but reuters spoke to him by telephone in collecchio , near parma .
“ i 've not run off anywhere , ” he said , adding he had not yet been contacted by justice officials . he declined to comment on the € 4-billion hole in parmalat 's accounts . with material from wire reports -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties call for war on creative accounting german politicians are calling for auditors to be placed under stricter control and for the federal supervisory authorities to be given increased powers to avoid the accounting problems plaguing american corporations .

dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urope 's laboratory on the international space station in terms of the international space station , we are also preparing the columbus european research laboratory module as well as the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- support module -lrb- see illustration at top of story -rrb- , which will be transported by ariane rockets .
the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .
the dominant question is always how can we utilize it ?
as i indicated , esa and dlr are focusing more on earth observation . bildunterschrift : torgau : vergleich , 14 .

we were able to use our own space technology to monitor the recent flooding in france and eastern germany as well as the wildfires in california and the peat fires in china .
these technologies enable us to pinpoint the origins of a natural disaster , what the growth of the disaster is and where you have to put measures in place that can be most effectively utilized .
with fires , if you can identify the center and the highest intensity , then you know where you need to do certain things .
those are just some of the ways in which we seek to differentiate ourselves from other space programs . interview conducted by daryl lindsey back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .

this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .

has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urope 's laboratory on the international space station in terms of the international space station , we are also preparing the columbus european research laboratory module as well as the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- support module -lrb- see illustration at top of story -rrb- , which will be transported by ariane rockets .
the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .
the dominant question is always how can we utilize it ?
as i indicated , esa and dlr are focusing more on earth observation . bildunterschrift : torgau : vergleich , 14 .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy . in a surprise announcement on friday , libya admitted to producing weapons of mass destruction but agreed to scrap the program and submit to international inspections .
the announcement came after nine months of secret negotiations between great britain and libya and marks the latest in a series of efforts by the government in tripoli – in the face of mounting pressure on “ rogue states ” – to rehabilitate its image . tony blair rushed before the cameras on friday to praise the decision , heralding it as a sign that disputes over weapons of mass destruction , as opposed to the outcome in iraq , could be resolved peacefully .
“ it shows that problems of proliferation can , with good will , be tackled through discussion and engagement , ” blair said . bush also reacted positively and dangled the carrot of improved relations between libya and the united states .
“ as the libyan government takes these essential steps and demonstrates its seriousness , its good faith will be returned .
libya can regain a secure and respected place among the nations over time , and achieve far better relations with the united states , ” he said . but when bush says “ over time ” , he means it .
administration officials told reuters that the sanctions currently imposed on libya will remain in place until further notice .
“ we will work with them as long as they are genuine in their initiative .
we ’ re not at the point of discussing how this affects the sanctions regime , ” said the official . so what exactly will the libyans be giving up ?
according to experts , libya has ten questionable sites which are believed to be devoted to the development and production of chemical and biological weapons .
and libya is believed to have been close to attaining nuclear capability . libya looks to rehabilitate image for much of the past year , libya has been inching closer towards rejoining the international community and shaking off its pariah status .
in august , the united nations lifted international sanctions after libya officially accepted responsibility for the bombing of a pan am airplane over lockerbie , scotland in 1988 and agreed to pay retributions .
in a strange overlap , this latest announcement came two days before the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing on sunday . following the iraq war , the decision to rejoin the international community represents one of two avenues currently available to rogue leaders in possession of secret and illegal weapons programs .
after observing the fate of saddam hussein , libya ’ s leader , col. moammar gadhafi , decided to take a different route and submit to international inspections .
what ’ s more , if and when us sanctions are lifted , he has a lot to gain , and that , appears to have been , partly , what motivated him to change course . on saturday , minister mohamed abderrhmane chalgam , libya ’ s foreign minister , told al jazeera television that his government was hoping to get back into the good graces of britain and the united states .
“ libya wants to solve all problems and we want to focus on development and advancing our country , ” he said .
“ we want to have ties with america and britain because this is in the interest of our people . ” another victory for european diplomacy the outcome in libya signals another victory for european diplomacy in dealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
while the us has opted to take a heavy handed approach with iraq , many governments in europe , including germany and france , have chosen to engage isolationist countries with a carrot and stick approach . in october , foreign ministers from europe ’ s big three – great britain , france and germany – travelled to iran and successfully convinced iranian officials to agree to nuclear inspections .

after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy . in a surprise announcement on friday , libya admitted to producing weapons of mass destruction but agreed to scrap the program and submit to international inspections .
the announcement came after nine months of secret negotiations between great britain and libya and marks the latest in a series of efforts by the government in tripoli – in the face of mounting pressure on “ rogue states ” – to rehabilitate its image . tony blair rushed before the cameras on friday to praise the decision , heralding it as a sign that disputes over weapons of mass destruction , as opposed to the outcome in iraq , could be resolved peacefully .
“ it shows that problems of proliferation can , with good will , be tackled through discussion and engagement , ” blair said . bush also reacted positively and dangled the carrot of improved relations between libya and the united states .
“ as the libyan government takes these essential steps and demonstrates its seriousness , its good faith will be returned .
libya can regain a secure and respected place among the nations over time , and achieve far better relations with the united states , ” he said . but when bush says “ over time ” , he means it .
administration officials told reuters that the sanctions currently imposed on libya will remain in place until further notice .
“ we will work with them as long as they are genuine in their initiative .
we ’ re not at the point of discussing how this affects the sanctions regime , ” said the official . so what exactly will the libyans be giving up ?
according to experts , libya has ten questionable sites which are believed to be devoted to the development and production of chemical and biological weapons .
and libya is believed to have been close to attaining nuclear capability . libya looks to rehabilitate image for much of the past year , libya has been inching closer towards rejoining the international community and shaking off its pariah status .
in august , the united nations lifted international sanctions after libya officially accepted responsibility for the bombing of a pan am airplane over lockerbie , scotland in 1988 and agreed to pay retributions .
in a strange overlap , this latest announcement came two days before the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing on sunday . following the iraq war , the decision to rejoin the international community represents one of two avenues currently available to rogue leaders in possession of secret and illegal weapons programs .
after observing the fate of saddam hussein , libya ’ s leader , col. moammar gadhafi , decided to take a different route and submit to international inspections .
what ’ s more , if and when us sanctions are lifted , he has a lot to gain , and that , appears to have been , partly , what motivated him to change course . on saturday , minister mohamed abderrhmane chalgam , libya ’ s foreign minister , told al jazeera television that his government was hoping to get back into the good graces of britain and the united states .
“ libya wants to solve all problems and we want to focus on development and advancing our country , ” he said .
“ we want to have ties with america and britain because this is in the interest of our people . ” another victory for european diplomacy the outcome in libya signals another victory for european diplomacy in dealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
while the us has opted to take a heavy handed approach with iraq , many governments in europe , including germany and france , have chosen to engage isolationist countries with a carrot and stick approach . in october , foreign ministers from europe ’ s big three – great britain , france and germany – travelled to iran and successfully convinced iranian officials to agree to nuclear inspections .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .

the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.12.2003 how to say " enron " in italian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dairy conglomerate parmalat operates in over 30 countries .
casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .
that led to the firms founder and chairman calisto tanzi to surprisingly hand over control to enrico bondi , a man with a reputation for turning around troubled businesses . bondi is now likely to file for protection from creditors as he tries to get the company 's books in order .
according to the reuters news agency , bondi was to meet with italian industry minister antonio marzano to discuss how to proceed . italian prosecutors are now also involved to determine the extent of criminal activity such as fraud .
along with the company ’ s auditors , grant thornton and deloitte & touche , ex-finance director fausto tonna will come in for considerable scrutiny . some italian newspapers had reported that tonna had fled to venezuela , but reuters spoke to him by telephone in collecchio , near parma .
“ i 've not run off anywhere , ” he said , adding he had not yet been contacted by justice officials . he declined to comment on the € 4-billion hole in parmalat 's accounts . with material from wire reports -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties call for war on creative accounting german politicians are calling for auditors to be placed under stricter control and for the federal supervisory authorities to be given increased powers to avoid the accounting problems plaguing american corporations .

a pilot project in germany is training refugees to be “ language and culture mediators , ” with the aim of helping other refugees adjust to their new homeland . for many people , a visit to the doctor can be intimidating .
the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .

libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .
even reputed rogues should be given the right to redeem themselves - better late than never . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya to give up weapons program after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .

the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .

libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .
even reputed rogues should be given the right to redeem themselves - better late than never . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya to give up weapons program after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .

looks matter if first impressions are important , then those arriving by rail will no doubt be impressed by leipzig .
the central station is one of the most beautiful and modern railway terminals in europe .
from the station , it 's just a few strides to the historic town center , most of it faithfully restored after large-scale destruction in world war ii .

university town leipzig university was founded almost 600 years ago , making leipzig one of germany 's oldest university towns .
it is still one of europe 's most highly respected seats of learning , and attracts some 24,000 students to follow a variety of courses .
business and trade-related degrees have long since been added to the science faculty course list - a fact no doubt related to leipzig 's long-standing tradition as a trading center .
capitalizing on its geographical position as a gateway between east the west , leipzig has hosted key international trade fairs for more than 800 years , making it a gathering point for people from all over europe .
in 1497 its two annual markets , at easter and at michaelmas , were promoted to the rank of " imperial fair . "
today , leipzig 's trade fairs are held in the neue messe , or new fairground .
perhaps the most prominent event held there is the annual book fair , which sees some 2,000 publishing companies from around the world presenting their wares .

there are many who say that the heart of the east german resistance movement lay in leipzig .
the regular prayer services and demonstrations that took place every monday at the nikolaikirche in the autumn of 1989 had a knock-on effect , inspiring similar peaceful protests in the capital berlin .
these eventually led to the fall of the berlin wall in november of that year , and the subsequent downfall of the east german communist regime .

a pilot project in germany is training refugees to be “ language and culture mediators , ” with the aim of helping other refugees adjust to their new homeland . for many people , a visit to the doctor can be intimidating .
the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.12.2003 how to say " enron " in italian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dairy conglomerate parmalat operates in over 30 countries .
casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .

but the saxon city nonetheless holds its own as a major cultural and intellectual center . leipzig has been in the world spotlight lately due to its bid to host the olympic games .
but the city also hopes the upbeat saying will give it a boost toward achieving its past glory as an illustrious center of trade , publishing and science . much still needs to be done - leipzig has more construction projects underway than anywhere else in germany except berlin .
but the saxon city nonetheless holds its own as a major cultural and intellectual center , and an attractive one , at that .
looks matter if first impressions are important , then those arriving by rail will no doubt be impressed by leipzig .
the central station is one of the most beautiful and modern railway terminals in europe .
from the station , it 's just a few strides to the historic town center , most of it faithfully restored after large-scale destruction in world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.s. bach was cantor in leipzig 's thomaskirche for many years highlights of a stroll in this picturesque district are the old city hall and its ' newer ' counterpart -lrb- although ' new ' in this case means well over a century old -rrb- , the market square and the church of st. thomas , which dates from the late 15th century .
with a population of half a million , leipzig has all the amenities of a large city without the disorienting sprawl .
shops , banks , theaters , cinemas , restaurants , the university - all can be reached on foot .
university town leipzig university was founded almost 600 years ago , making leipzig one of germany 's oldest university towns .
it is still one of europe 's most highly respected seats of learning , and attracts some 24,000 students to follow a variety of courses .
business and trade-related degrees have long since been added to the science faculty course list - a fact no doubt related to leipzig 's long-standing tradition as a trading center .
capitalizing on its geographical position as a gateway between east the west , leipzig has hosted key international trade fairs for more than 800 years , making it a gathering point for people from all over europe .
in 1497 its two annual markets , at easter and at michaelmas , were promoted to the rank of " imperial fair . "
today , leipzig 's trade fairs are held in the neue messe , or new fairground .
perhaps the most prominent event held there is the annual book fair , which sees some 2,000 publishing companies from around the world presenting their wares .
read all about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monday demonstrations in leipzig contributed to the fall of communism printing and media have always been important to leipzig .
the world 's first daily newspaper was printed here 350 years ago , and the world 's first media research center was established at the university of leipzig even before world war i. the " mitteldeutscher rundfunk , " germany 's third largest public broadcasting station , is also based in leipzig , and , despite years behind the iron curtain , the city remains home to a number of major german publishers .
there are many who say that the heart of the east german resistance movement lay in leipzig .
the regular prayer services and demonstrations that took place every monday at the nikolaikirche in the autumn of 1989 had a knock-on effect , inspiring similar peaceful protests in the capital berlin .
these eventually led to the fall of the berlin wall in november of that year , and the subsequent downfall of the east german communist regime .
bach , mendelssohn & co .
leipzig residents have a special fondness for the church of st. thomas , where theologian and reformer martin luther held sermons - just 50 kilometers from the town of wittenberg , where he nailed his 95 theses protesting the papal bull to the church door in 1517 .
the act eventually led to the founding of the protestant church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basement pub auerbach 's keller was made famous in goethe 's " faust " over 100 years later , the church achieved great fame yet again , as the place where a certain cantor called johann sebastian bach worked , from 1723 until his death .
the church has housed bach 's tomb since 1950 .
the city 's gewandhaus concerts , which are still held to this day , were made famous by felix mendelssohn , who died here in 1847 .
as for the city 's claims to literary fame , the young goethe studied there in 1765 , and gottsched , gellert , and schiller - to name but a few - made leipzig a literary center in the 18th century .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.12.2003 opinion : a model for successful pressure against rogue nations ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's likely economic considerations motivated gadhafi to change course .
libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .
even reputed rogues should be given the right to redeem themselves - better late than never . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya to give up weapons program after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .

a pilot project in germany is training refugees to be “ language and culture mediators , ” with the aim of helping other refugees adjust to their new homeland . for many people , a visit to the doctor can be intimidating .
the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.12.2003 opinion : a model for successful pressure against rogue nations ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's likely economic considerations motivated gadhafi to change course .
libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .
even reputed rogues should be given the right to redeem themselves - better late than never . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya to give up weapons program after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

a pilot project in germany is training refugees to be “ language and culture mediators , ” with the aim of helping other refugees adjust to their new homeland . for many people , a visit to the doctor can be intimidating .
the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .

but the saxon city nonetheless holds its own as a major cultural and intellectual center . leipzig has been in the world spotlight lately due to its bid to host the olympic games .
but the city also hopes the upbeat saying will give it a boost toward achieving its past glory as an illustrious center of trade , publishing and science . much still needs to be done - leipzig has more construction projects underway than anywhere else in germany except berlin .
but the saxon city nonetheless holds its own as a major cultural and intellectual center , and an attractive one , at that .
looks matter if first impressions are important , then those arriving by rail will no doubt be impressed by leipzig .
the central station is one of the most beautiful and modern railway terminals in europe .
from the station , it 's just a few strides to the historic town center , most of it faithfully restored after large-scale destruction in world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.s. bach was cantor in leipzig 's thomaskirche for many years highlights of a stroll in this picturesque district are the old city hall and its ' newer ' counterpart -lrb- although ' new ' in this case means well over a century old -rrb- , the market square and the church of st. thomas , which dates from the late 15th century .
with a population of half a million , leipzig has all the amenities of a large city without the disorienting sprawl .
shops , banks , theaters , cinemas , restaurants , the university - all can be reached on foot .
university town leipzig university was founded almost 600 years ago , making leipzig one of germany 's oldest university towns .
it is still one of europe 's most highly respected seats of learning , and attracts some 24,000 students to follow a variety of courses .
business and trade-related degrees have long since been added to the science faculty course list - a fact no doubt related to leipzig 's long-standing tradition as a trading center .
capitalizing on its geographical position as a gateway between east the west , leipzig has hosted key international trade fairs for more than 800 years , making it a gathering point for people from all over europe .
in 1497 its two annual markets , at easter and at michaelmas , were promoted to the rank of " imperial fair . "
today , leipzig 's trade fairs are held in the neue messe , or new fairground .
perhaps the most prominent event held there is the annual book fair , which sees some 2,000 publishing companies from around the world presenting their wares .
read all about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monday demonstrations in leipzig contributed to the fall of communism printing and media have always been important to leipzig .
the world 's first daily newspaper was printed here 350 years ago , and the world 's first media research center was established at the university of leipzig even before world war i. the " mitteldeutscher rundfunk , " germany 's third largest public broadcasting station , is also based in leipzig , and , despite years behind the iron curtain , the city remains home to a number of major german publishers .
there are many who say that the heart of the east german resistance movement lay in leipzig .
the regular prayer services and demonstrations that took place every monday at the nikolaikirche in the autumn of 1989 had a knock-on effect , inspiring similar peaceful protests in the capital berlin .
these eventually led to the fall of the berlin wall in november of that year , and the subsequent downfall of the east german communist regime .
bach , mendelssohn & co .
leipzig residents have a special fondness for the church of st. thomas , where theologian and reformer martin luther held sermons - just 50 kilometers from the town of wittenberg , where he nailed his 95 theses protesting the papal bull to the church door in 1517 .
the act eventually led to the founding of the protestant church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basement pub auerbach 's keller was made famous in goethe 's " faust " over 100 years later , the church achieved great fame yet again , as the place where a certain cantor called johann sebastian bach worked , from 1723 until his death .
the church has housed bach 's tomb since 1950 .
the city 's gewandhaus concerts , which are still held to this day , were made famous by felix mendelssohn , who died here in 1847 .
as for the city 's claims to literary fame , the young goethe studied there in 1765 , and gottsched , gellert , and schiller - to name but a few - made leipzig a literary center in the 18th century .

after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy . in a surprise announcement on friday , libya admitted to producing weapons of mass destruction but agreed to scrap the program and submit to international inspections .
the announcement came after nine months of secret negotiations between great britain and libya and marks the latest in a series of efforts by the government in tripoli – in the face of mounting pressure on “ rogue states ” – to rehabilitate its image . tony blair rushed before the cameras on friday to praise the decision , heralding it as a sign that disputes over weapons of mass destruction , as opposed to the outcome in iraq , could be resolved peacefully .
“ it shows that problems of proliferation can , with good will , be tackled through discussion and engagement , ” blair said . bush also reacted positively and dangled the carrot of improved relations between libya and the united states .
“ as the libyan government takes these essential steps and demonstrates its seriousness , its good faith will be returned .
libya can regain a secure and respected place among the nations over time , and achieve far better relations with the united states , ” he said . but when bush says “ over time ” , he means it .
administration officials told reuters that the sanctions currently imposed on libya will remain in place until further notice .
“ we will work with them as long as they are genuine in their initiative .
we ’ re not at the point of discussing how this affects the sanctions regime , ” said the official . so what exactly will the libyans be giving up ?
according to experts , libya has ten questionable sites which are believed to be devoted to the development and production of chemical and biological weapons .
and libya is believed to have been close to attaining nuclear capability . libya looks to rehabilitate image for much of the past year , libya has been inching closer towards rejoining the international community and shaking off its pariah status .
in august , the united nations lifted international sanctions after libya officially accepted responsibility for the bombing of a pan am airplane over lockerbie , scotland in 1988 and agreed to pay retributions .
in a strange overlap , this latest announcement came two days before the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing on sunday . following the iraq war , the decision to rejoin the international community represents one of two avenues currently available to rogue leaders in possession of secret and illegal weapons programs .
after observing the fate of saddam hussein , libya ’ s leader , col. moammar gadhafi , decided to take a different route and submit to international inspections .
what ’ s more , if and when us sanctions are lifted , he has a lot to gain , and that , appears to have been , partly , what motivated him to change course . on saturday , minister mohamed abderrhmane chalgam , libya ’ s foreign minister , told al jazeera television that his government was hoping to get back into the good graces of britain and the united states .
“ libya wants to solve all problems and we want to focus on development and advancing our country , ” he said .
“ we want to have ties with america and britain because this is in the interest of our people . ” another victory for european diplomacy the outcome in libya signals another victory for european diplomacy in dealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
while the us has opted to take a heavy handed approach with iraq , many governments in europe , including germany and france , have chosen to engage isolationist countries with a carrot and stick approach . in october , foreign ministers from europe ’ s big three – great britain , france and germany – travelled to iran and successfully convinced iranian officials to agree to nuclear inspections .
libya ’ s decision may send a message to north korea , which remains defiant despite mounting international pressure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran agrees to inspections after eu talks the foreign ministers of europe 's big three - great britain , france and germany - breathed a sigh of relief when iranian officials agreed to nuclear inspections after a tense day of talks .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urope 's laboratory on the international space station in terms of the international space station , we are also preparing the columbus european research laboratory module as well as the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- support module -lrb- see illustration at top of story -rrb- , which will be transported by ariane rockets .
the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .
the dominant question is always how can we utilize it ?
as i indicated , esa and dlr are focusing more on earth observation . bildunterschrift : torgau : vergleich , 14 .

these technologies enable us to pinpoint the origins of a natural disaster , what the growth of the disaster is and where you have to put measures in place that can be most effectively utilized .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .

libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

a pilot project in germany is training refugees to be “ language and culture mediators , ” with the aim of helping other refugees adjust to their new homeland . for many people , a visit to the doctor can be intimidating .
the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.12.2003 libya to give up weapons program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : give peace a chance : libyan leader moammar gadhafi will shelve his weapons program .
after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy . in a surprise announcement on friday , libya admitted to producing weapons of mass destruction but agreed to scrap the program and submit to international inspections .
the announcement came after nine months of secret negotiations between great britain and libya and marks the latest in a series of efforts by the government in tripoli – in the face of mounting pressure on “ rogue states ” – to rehabilitate its image . tony blair rushed before the cameras on friday to praise the decision , heralding it as a sign that disputes over weapons of mass destruction , as opposed to the outcome in iraq , could be resolved peacefully .
“ it shows that problems of proliferation can , with good will , be tackled through discussion and engagement , ” blair said . bush also reacted positively and dangled the carrot of improved relations between libya and the united states .
“ as the libyan government takes these essential steps and demonstrates its seriousness , its good faith will be returned .
libya can regain a secure and respected place among the nations over time , and achieve far better relations with the united states , ” he said . but when bush says “ over time ” , he means it .
administration officials told reuters that the sanctions currently imposed on libya will remain in place until further notice .
“ we will work with them as long as they are genuine in their initiative .
we ’ re not at the point of discussing how this affects the sanctions regime , ” said the official . so what exactly will the libyans be giving up ?
according to experts , libya has ten questionable sites which are believed to be devoted to the development and production of chemical and biological weapons .
and libya is believed to have been close to attaining nuclear capability . libya looks to rehabilitate image for much of the past year , libya has been inching closer towards rejoining the international community and shaking off its pariah status .
in august , the united nations lifted international sanctions after libya officially accepted responsibility for the bombing of a pan am airplane over lockerbie , scotland in 1988 and agreed to pay retributions .
in a strange overlap , this latest announcement came two days before the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing on sunday . following the iraq war , the decision to rejoin the international community represents one of two avenues currently available to rogue leaders in possession of secret and illegal weapons programs .
after observing the fate of saddam hussein , libya ’ s leader , col. moammar gadhafi , decided to take a different route and submit to international inspections .
what ’ s more , if and when us sanctions are lifted , he has a lot to gain , and that , appears to have been , partly , what motivated him to change course . on saturday , minister mohamed abderrhmane chalgam , libya ’ s foreign minister , told al jazeera television that his government was hoping to get back into the good graces of britain and the united states .
“ libya wants to solve all problems and we want to focus on development and advancing our country , ” he said .
“ we want to have ties with america and britain because this is in the interest of our people . ” another victory for european diplomacy the outcome in libya signals another victory for european diplomacy in dealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
while the us has opted to take a heavy handed approach with iraq , many governments in europe , including germany and france , have chosen to engage isolationist countries with a carrot and stick approach . in october , foreign ministers from europe ’ s big three – great britain , france and germany – travelled to iran and successfully convinced iranian officials to agree to nuclear inspections .
libya ’ s decision may send a message to north korea , which remains defiant despite mounting international pressure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran agrees to inspections after eu talks the foreign ministers of europe 's big three - great britain , france and germany - breathed a sigh of relief when iranian officials agreed to nuclear inspections after a tense day of talks .

a pilot project in germany is training refugees to be “ language and culture mediators , ” with the aim of helping other refugees adjust to their new homeland . for many people , a visit to the doctor can be intimidating .
the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urope 's laboratory on the international space station in terms of the international space station , we are also preparing the columbus european research laboratory module as well as the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- support module -lrb- see illustration at top of story -rrb- , which will be transported by ariane rockets .
the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urope 's laboratory on the international space station in terms of the international space station , we are also preparing the columbus european research laboratory module as well as the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- support module -lrb- see illustration at top of story -rrb- , which will be transported by ariane rockets .
the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urope 's laboratory on the international space station in terms of the international space station , we are also preparing the columbus european research laboratory module as well as the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- support module -lrb- see illustration at top of story -rrb- , which will be transported by ariane rockets .
the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .

the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .
the dominant question is always how can we utilize it ?
as i indicated , esa and dlr are focusing more on earth observation . bildunterschrift : torgau : vergleich , 14 .

these technologies enable us to pinpoint the origins of a natural disaster , what the growth of the disaster is and where you have to put measures in place that can be most effectively utilized .
with fires , if you can identify the center and the highest intensity , then you know where you need to do certain things .
those are just some of the ways in which we seek to differentiate ourselves from other space programs . interview conducted by daryl lindsey back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy . in a surprise announcement on friday , libya admitted to producing weapons of mass destruction but agreed to scrap the program and submit to international inspections .
the announcement came after nine months of secret negotiations between great britain and libya and marks the latest in a series of efforts by the government in tripoli – in the face of mounting pressure on “ rogue states ” – to rehabilitate its image . tony blair rushed before the cameras on friday to praise the decision , heralding it as a sign that disputes over weapons of mass destruction , as opposed to the outcome in iraq , could be resolved peacefully .
“ it shows that problems of proliferation can , with good will , be tackled through discussion and engagement , ” blair said . bush also reacted positively and dangled the carrot of improved relations between libya and the united states .
“ as the libyan government takes these essential steps and demonstrates its seriousness , its good faith will be returned .
libya can regain a secure and respected place among the nations over time , and achieve far better relations with the united states , ” he said . but when bush says “ over time ” , he means it .
administration officials told reuters that the sanctions currently imposed on libya will remain in place until further notice .
“ we will work with them as long as they are genuine in their initiative .
we ’ re not at the point of discussing how this affects the sanctions regime , ” said the official . so what exactly will the libyans be giving up ?
according to experts , libya has ten questionable sites which are believed to be devoted to the development and production of chemical and biological weapons .
and libya is believed to have been close to attaining nuclear capability . libya looks to rehabilitate image for much of the past year , libya has been inching closer towards rejoining the international community and shaking off its pariah status .
in august , the united nations lifted international sanctions after libya officially accepted responsibility for the bombing of a pan am airplane over lockerbie , scotland in 1988 and agreed to pay retributions .
in a strange overlap , this latest announcement came two days before the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing on sunday . following the iraq war , the decision to rejoin the international community represents one of two avenues currently available to rogue leaders in possession of secret and illegal weapons programs .
after observing the fate of saddam hussein , libya ’ s leader , col. moammar gadhafi , decided to take a different route and submit to international inspections .
what ’ s more , if and when us sanctions are lifted , he has a lot to gain , and that , appears to have been , partly , what motivated him to change course . on saturday , minister mohamed abderrhmane chalgam , libya ’ s foreign minister , told al jazeera television that his government was hoping to get back into the good graces of britain and the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.12.2003 how to say " enron " in italian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dairy conglomerate parmalat operates in over 30 countries .
casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .
that led to the firms founder and chairman calisto tanzi to surprisingly hand over control to enrico bondi , a man with a reputation for turning around troubled businesses . bondi is now likely to file for protection from creditors as he tries to get the company 's books in order .
according to the reuters news agency , bondi was to meet with italian industry minister antonio marzano to discuss how to proceed . italian prosecutors are now also involved to determine the extent of criminal activity such as fraud .
along with the company ’ s auditors , grant thornton and deloitte & touche , ex-finance director fausto tonna will come in for considerable scrutiny . some italian newspapers had reported that tonna had fled to venezuela , but reuters spoke to him by telephone in collecchio , near parma .
“ i 've not run off anywhere , ” he said , adding he had not yet been contacted by justice officials . he declined to comment on the € 4-billion hole in parmalat 's accounts . with material from wire reports -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties call for war on creative accounting german politicians are calling for auditors to be placed under stricter control and for the federal supervisory authorities to be given increased powers to avoid the accounting problems plaguing american corporations .

the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .
the project helps other refugees get in touch with their families and friends -lrb- oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.12.2003 how to say " enron " in italian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dairy conglomerate parmalat operates in over 30 countries .
casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .
that led to the firms founder and chairman calisto tanzi to surprisingly hand over control to enrico bondi , a man with a reputation for turning around troubled businesses . bondi is now likely to file for protection from creditors as he tries to get the company 's books in order .
according to the reuters news agency , bondi was to meet with italian industry minister antonio marzano to discuss how to proceed . italian prosecutors are now also involved to determine the extent of criminal activity such as fraud .
along with the company ’ s auditors , grant thornton and deloitte & touche , ex-finance director fausto tonna will come in for considerable scrutiny . some italian newspapers had reported that tonna had fled to venezuela , but reuters spoke to him by telephone in collecchio , near parma .
“ i 've not run off anywhere , ” he said , adding he had not yet been contacted by justice officials . he declined to comment on the € 4-billion hole in parmalat 's accounts . with material from wire reports -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties call for war on creative accounting german politicians are calling for auditors to be placed under stricter control and for the federal supervisory authorities to be given increased powers to avoid the accounting problems plaguing american corporations .

libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .
even reputed rogues should be given the right to redeem themselves - better late than never . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya to give up weapons program after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .

and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .
even reputed rogues should be given the right to redeem themselves - better late than never . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya to give up weapons program after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .

the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urope 's laboratory on the international space station in terms of the international space station , we are also preparing the columbus european research laboratory module as well as the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- support module -lrb- see illustration at top of story -rrb- , which will be transported by ariane rockets .
the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .

dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .

dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

a pilot project in germany is training refugees to be “ language and culture mediators , ” with the aim of helping other refugees adjust to their new homeland . for many people , a visit to the doctor can be intimidating .
the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .

after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy . in a surprise announcement on friday , libya admitted to producing weapons of mass destruction but agreed to scrap the program and submit to international inspections .
the announcement came after nine months of secret negotiations between great britain and libya and marks the latest in a series of efforts by the government in tripoli – in the face of mounting pressure on “ rogue states ” – to rehabilitate its image . tony blair rushed before the cameras on friday to praise the decision , heralding it as a sign that disputes over weapons of mass destruction , as opposed to the outcome in iraq , could be resolved peacefully .
“ it shows that problems of proliferation can , with good will , be tackled through discussion and engagement , ” blair said . bush also reacted positively and dangled the carrot of improved relations between libya and the united states .
“ as the libyan government takes these essential steps and demonstrates its seriousness , its good faith will be returned .
libya can regain a secure and respected place among the nations over time , and achieve far better relations with the united states , ” he said . but when bush says “ over time ” , he means it .
administration officials told reuters that the sanctions currently imposed on libya will remain in place until further notice .
“ we will work with them as long as they are genuine in their initiative .
we ’ re not at the point of discussing how this affects the sanctions regime , ” said the official . so what exactly will the libyans be giving up ?
according to experts , libya has ten questionable sites which are believed to be devoted to the development and production of chemical and biological weapons .
and libya is believed to have been close to attaining nuclear capability . libya looks to rehabilitate image for much of the past year , libya has been inching closer towards rejoining the international community and shaking off its pariah status .
in august , the united nations lifted international sanctions after libya officially accepted responsibility for the bombing of a pan am airplane over lockerbie , scotland in 1988 and agreed to pay retributions .
in a strange overlap , this latest announcement came two days before the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing on sunday . following the iraq war , the decision to rejoin the international community represents one of two avenues currently available to rogue leaders in possession of secret and illegal weapons programs .
after observing the fate of saddam hussein , libya ’ s leader , col. moammar gadhafi , decided to take a different route and submit to international inspections .
what ’ s more , if and when us sanctions are lifted , he has a lot to gain , and that , appears to have been , partly , what motivated him to change course . on saturday , minister mohamed abderrhmane chalgam , libya ’ s foreign minister , told al jazeera television that his government was hoping to get back into the good graces of britain and the united states .
“ libya wants to solve all problems and we want to focus on development and advancing our country , ” he said .
“ we want to have ties with america and britain because this is in the interest of our people . ” another victory for european diplomacy the outcome in libya signals another victory for european diplomacy in dealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
while the us has opted to take a heavy handed approach with iraq , many governments in europe , including germany and france , have chosen to engage isolationist countries with a carrot and stick approach . in october , foreign ministers from europe ’ s big three – great britain , france and germany – travelled to iran and successfully convinced iranian officials to agree to nuclear inspections .
libya ’ s decision may send a message to north korea , which remains defiant despite mounting international pressure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran agrees to inspections after eu talks the foreign ministers of europe 's big three - great britain , france and germany - breathed a sigh of relief when iranian officials agreed to nuclear inspections after a tense day of talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.12.2003 with space program , europe looks to mars and earth 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an interview with dw-world , german aerospace center chairman sigmar wittig discusses the mars express mission and what it means for the future of european space exploration . with the planned christmas day landing of the beagle 2 probe on the surface of mars , europe 's first mission to another planet , a new chapter will be written in the history of european space travel .
but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .

casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.12.2003 opinion : a model for successful pressure against rogue nations ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's likely economic considerations motivated gadhafi to change course .
libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .
even reputed rogues should be given the right to redeem themselves - better late than never . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya to give up weapons program after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy .

libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .
even reputed rogues should be given the right to redeem themselves - better late than never . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya to give up weapons program after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.12.2003 how to say " enron " in italian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dairy conglomerate parmalat operates in over 30 countries .
casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .
that led to the firms founder and chairman calisto tanzi to surprisingly hand over control to enrico bondi , a man with a reputation for turning around troubled businesses . bondi is now likely to file for protection from creditors as he tries to get the company 's books in order .
according to the reuters news agency , bondi was to meet with italian industry minister antonio marzano to discuss how to proceed . italian prosecutors are now also involved to determine the extent of criminal activity such as fraud .
along with the company ’ s auditors , grant thornton and deloitte & touche , ex-finance director fausto tonna will come in for considerable scrutiny . some italian newspapers had reported that tonna had fled to venezuela , but reuters spoke to him by telephone in collecchio , near parma .
“ i 've not run off anywhere , ” he said , adding he had not yet been contacted by justice officials . he declined to comment on the € 4-billion hole in parmalat 's accounts . with material from wire reports -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties call for war on creative accounting german politicians are calling for auditors to be placed under stricter control and for the federal supervisory authorities to be given increased powers to avoid the accounting problems plaguing american corporations .

after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy . in a surprise announcement on friday , libya admitted to producing weapons of mass destruction but agreed to scrap the program and submit to international inspections .
the announcement came after nine months of secret negotiations between great britain and libya and marks the latest in a series of efforts by the government in tripoli – in the face of mounting pressure on “ rogue states ” – to rehabilitate its image . tony blair rushed before the cameras on friday to praise the decision , heralding it as a sign that disputes over weapons of mass destruction , as opposed to the outcome in iraq , could be resolved peacefully .
“ it shows that problems of proliferation can , with good will , be tackled through discussion and engagement , ” blair said . bush also reacted positively and dangled the carrot of improved relations between libya and the united states .
“ as the libyan government takes these essential steps and demonstrates its seriousness , its good faith will be returned .
libya can regain a secure and respected place among the nations over time , and achieve far better relations with the united states , ” he said . but when bush says “ over time ” , he means it .
administration officials told reuters that the sanctions currently imposed on libya will remain in place until further notice .
“ we will work with them as long as they are genuine in their initiative .
we ’ re not at the point of discussing how this affects the sanctions regime , ” said the official . so what exactly will the libyans be giving up ?
according to experts , libya has ten questionable sites which are believed to be devoted to the development and production of chemical and biological weapons .
and libya is believed to have been close to attaining nuclear capability . libya looks to rehabilitate image for much of the past year , libya has been inching closer towards rejoining the international community and shaking off its pariah status .
in august , the united nations lifted international sanctions after libya officially accepted responsibility for the bombing of a pan am airplane over lockerbie , scotland in 1988 and agreed to pay retributions .
in a strange overlap , this latest announcement came two days before the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing on sunday . following the iraq war , the decision to rejoin the international community represents one of two avenues currently available to rogue leaders in possession of secret and illegal weapons programs .
after observing the fate of saddam hussein , libya ’ s leader , col. moammar gadhafi , decided to take a different route and submit to international inspections .
what ’ s more , if and when us sanctions are lifted , he has a lot to gain , and that , appears to have been , partly , what motivated him to change course . on saturday , minister mohamed abderrhmane chalgam , libya ’ s foreign minister , told al jazeera television that his government was hoping to get back into the good graces of britain and the united states .
“ libya wants to solve all problems and we want to focus on development and advancing our country , ” he said .
“ we want to have ties with america and britain because this is in the interest of our people . ” another victory for european diplomacy the outcome in libya signals another victory for european diplomacy in dealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
while the us has opted to take a heavy handed approach with iraq , many governments in europe , including germany and france , have chosen to engage isolationist countries with a carrot and stick approach . in october , foreign ministers from europe ’ s big three – great britain , france and germany – travelled to iran and successfully convinced iranian officials to agree to nuclear inspections .

dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urope 's laboratory on the international space station in terms of the international space station , we are also preparing the columbus european research laboratory module as well as the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- support module -lrb- see illustration at top of story -rrb- , which will be transported by ariane rockets .
the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .
the dominant question is always how can we utilize it ?
as i indicated , esa and dlr are focusing more on earth observation . bildunterschrift : torgau : vergleich , 14 .

we were able to use our own space technology to monitor the recent flooding in france and eastern germany as well as the wildfires in california and the peat fires in china .
these technologies enable us to pinpoint the origins of a natural disaster , what the growth of the disaster is and where you have to put measures in place that can be most effectively utilized .
with fires , if you can identify the center and the highest intensity , then you know where you need to do certain things .
those are just some of the ways in which we seek to differentiate ourselves from other space programs . interview conducted by daryl lindsey back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urope 's laboratory on the international space station in terms of the international space station , we are also preparing the columbus european research laboratory module as well as the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- support module -lrb- see illustration at top of story -rrb- , which will be transported by ariane rockets .
the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .
the dominant question is always how can we utilize it ?

this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .

the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .

still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .

casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .
that led to the firms founder and chairman calisto tanzi to surprisingly hand over control to enrico bondi , a man with a reputation for turning around troubled businesses . bondi is now likely to file for protection from creditors as he tries to get the company 's books in order .
according to the reuters news agency , bondi was to meet with italian industry minister antonio marzano to discuss how to proceed . italian prosecutors are now also involved to determine the extent of criminal activity such as fraud .
along with the company ’ s auditors , grant thornton and deloitte & touche , ex-finance director fausto tonna will come in for considerable scrutiny . some italian newspapers had reported that tonna had fled to venezuela , but reuters spoke to him by telephone in collecchio , near parma .

a pilot project in germany is training refugees to be “ language and culture mediators , ” with the aim of helping other refugees adjust to their new homeland . for many people , a visit to the doctor can be intimidating .
the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .

a pilot project in germany is training refugees to be “ language and culture mediators , ” with the aim of helping other refugees adjust to their new homeland . for many people , a visit to the doctor can be intimidating .
the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .

but the saxon city nonetheless holds its own as a major cultural and intellectual center , and an attractive one , at that .
looks matter if first impressions are important , then those arriving by rail will no doubt be impressed by leipzig .
the central station is one of the most beautiful and modern railway terminals in europe .
from the station , it 's just a few strides to the historic town center , most of it faithfully restored after large-scale destruction in world war ii .

with a population of half a million , leipzig has all the amenities of a large city without the disorienting sprawl .
shops , banks , theaters , cinemas , restaurants , the university - all can be reached on foot .
university town leipzig university was founded almost 600 years ago , making leipzig one of germany 's oldest university towns .
it is still one of europe 's most highly respected seats of learning , and attracts some 24,000 students to follow a variety of courses .
business and trade-related degrees have long since been added to the science faculty course list - a fact no doubt related to leipzig 's long-standing tradition as a trading center .
capitalizing on its geographical position as a gateway between east the west , leipzig has hosted key international trade fairs for more than 800 years , making it a gathering point for people from all over europe .
in 1497 its two annual markets , at easter and at michaelmas , were promoted to the rank of " imperial fair . "

libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .

in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .

but the saxon city nonetheless holds its own as a major cultural and intellectual center . leipzig has been in the world spotlight lately due to its bid to host the olympic games .
but the city also hopes the upbeat saying will give it a boost toward achieving its past glory as an illustrious center of trade , publishing and science . much still needs to be done - leipzig has more construction projects underway than anywhere else in germany except berlin .
but the saxon city nonetheless holds its own as a major cultural and intellectual center , and an attractive one , at that .
looks matter if first impressions are important , then those arriving by rail will no doubt be impressed by leipzig .
the central station is one of the most beautiful and modern railway terminals in europe .
from the station , it 's just a few strides to the historic town center , most of it faithfully restored after large-scale destruction in world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.s. bach was cantor in leipzig 's thomaskirche for many years highlights of a stroll in this picturesque district are the old city hall and its ' newer ' counterpart -lrb- although ' new ' in this case means well over a century old -rrb- , the market square and the church of st. thomas , which dates from the late 15th century .
with a population of half a million , leipzig has all the amenities of a large city without the disorienting sprawl .
shops , banks , theaters , cinemas , restaurants , the university - all can be reached on foot .
university town leipzig university was founded almost 600 years ago , making leipzig one of germany 's oldest university towns .
it is still one of europe 's most highly respected seats of learning , and attracts some 24,000 students to follow a variety of courses .
business and trade-related degrees have long since been added to the science faculty course list - a fact no doubt related to leipzig 's long-standing tradition as a trading center .
capitalizing on its geographical position as a gateway between east the west , leipzig has hosted key international trade fairs for more than 800 years , making it a gathering point for people from all over europe .
in 1497 its two annual markets , at easter and at michaelmas , were promoted to the rank of " imperial fair . "
today , leipzig 's trade fairs are held in the neue messe , or new fairground .
perhaps the most prominent event held there is the annual book fair , which sees some 2,000 publishing companies from around the world presenting their wares .
read all about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monday demonstrations in leipzig contributed to the fall of communism printing and media have always been important to leipzig .
the world 's first daily newspaper was printed here 350 years ago , and the world 's first media research center was established at the university of leipzig even before world war i. the " mitteldeutscher rundfunk , " germany 's third largest public broadcasting station , is also based in leipzig , and , despite years behind the iron curtain , the city remains home to a number of major german publishers .
there are many who say that the heart of the east german resistance movement lay in leipzig .
the regular prayer services and demonstrations that took place every monday at the nikolaikirche in the autumn of 1989 had a knock-on effect , inspiring similar peaceful protests in the capital berlin .
these eventually led to the fall of the berlin wall in november of that year , and the subsequent downfall of the east german communist regime .
bach , mendelssohn & co .
leipzig residents have a special fondness for the church of st. thomas , where theologian and reformer martin luther held sermons - just 50 kilometers from the town of wittenberg , where he nailed his 95 theses protesting the papal bull to the church door in 1517 .
the act eventually led to the founding of the protestant church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basement pub auerbach 's keller was made famous in goethe 's " faust " over 100 years later , the church achieved great fame yet again , as the place where a certain cantor called johann sebastian bach worked , from 1723 until his death .
the church has housed bach 's tomb since 1950 .
the city 's gewandhaus concerts , which are still held to this day , were made famous by felix mendelssohn , who died here in 1847 .
as for the city 's claims to literary fame , the young goethe studied there in 1765 , and gottsched , gellert , and schiller - to name but a few - made leipzig a literary center in the 18th century .

from the station , it 's just a few strides to the historic town center , most of it faithfully restored after large-scale destruction in world war ii .

with a population of half a million , leipzig has all the amenities of a large city without the disorienting sprawl .
shops , banks , theaters , cinemas , restaurants , the university - all can be reached on foot .
university town leipzig university was founded almost 600 years ago , making leipzig one of germany 's oldest university towns .
it is still one of europe 's most highly respected seats of learning , and attracts some 24,000 students to follow a variety of courses .
business and trade-related degrees have long since been added to the science faculty course list - a fact no doubt related to leipzig 's long-standing tradition as a trading center .
capitalizing on its geographical position as a gateway between east the west , leipzig has hosted key international trade fairs for more than 800 years , making it a gathering point for people from all over europe .
in 1497 its two annual markets , at easter and at michaelmas , were promoted to the rank of " imperial fair . "
today , leipzig 's trade fairs are held in the neue messe , or new fairground .
perhaps the most prominent event held there is the annual book fair , which sees some 2,000 publishing companies from around the world presenting their wares .

there are many who say that the heart of the east german resistance movement lay in leipzig .
the regular prayer services and demonstrations that took place every monday at the nikolaikirche in the autumn of 1989 had a knock-on effect , inspiring similar peaceful protests in the capital berlin .
these eventually led to the fall of the berlin wall in november of that year , and the subsequent downfall of the east german communist regime .
bach , mendelssohn & co .
leipzig residents have a special fondness for the church of st. thomas , where theologian and reformer martin luther held sermons - just 50 kilometers from the town of wittenberg , where he nailed his 95 theses protesting the papal bull to the church door in 1517 .
the act eventually led to the founding of the protestant church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basement pub auerbach 's keller was made famous in goethe 's " faust " over 100 years later , the church achieved great fame yet again , as the place where a certain cantor called johann sebastian bach worked , from 1723 until his death .
the church has housed bach 's tomb since 1950 .
the city 's gewandhaus concerts , which are still held to this day , were made famous by felix mendelssohn , who died here in 1847 .
as for the city 's claims to literary fame , the young goethe studied there in 1765 , and gottsched , gellert , and schiller - to name but a few - made leipzig a literary center in the 18th century .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.12.2003 how to say " enron " in italian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dairy conglomerate parmalat operates in over 30 countries .
casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .
that led to the firms founder and chairman calisto tanzi to surprisingly hand over control to enrico bondi , a man with a reputation for turning around troubled businesses . bondi is now likely to file for protection from creditors as he tries to get the company 's books in order .
according to the reuters news agency , bondi was to meet with italian industry minister antonio marzano to discuss how to proceed . italian prosecutors are now also involved to determine the extent of criminal activity such as fraud .
along with the company ’ s auditors , grant thornton and deloitte & touche , ex-finance director fausto tonna will come in for considerable scrutiny . some italian newspapers had reported that tonna had fled to venezuela , but reuters spoke to him by telephone in collecchio , near parma .
“ i 've not run off anywhere , ” he said , adding he had not yet been contacted by justice officials . he declined to comment on the € 4-billion hole in parmalat 's accounts . with material from wire reports -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties call for war on creative accounting german politicians are calling for auditors to be placed under stricter control and for the federal supervisory authorities to be given increased powers to avoid the accounting problems plaguing american corporations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.12.2003 how to say " enron " in italian großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dairy conglomerate parmalat operates in over 30 countries .
casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .
that led to the firms founder and chairman calisto tanzi to surprisingly hand over control to enrico bondi , a man with a reputation for turning around troubled businesses . bondi is now likely to file for protection from creditors as he tries to get the company 's books in order .
according to the reuters news agency , bondi was to meet with italian industry minister antonio marzano to discuss how to proceed . italian prosecutors are now also involved to determine the extent of criminal activity such as fraud .
along with the company ’ s auditors , grant thornton and deloitte & touche , ex-finance director fausto tonna will come in for considerable scrutiny . some italian newspapers had reported that tonna had fled to venezuela , but reuters spoke to him by telephone in collecchio , near parma .
“ i 've not run off anywhere , ” he said , adding he had not yet been contacted by justice officials . he declined to comment on the € 4-billion hole in parmalat 's accounts . with material from wire reports -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties call for war on creative accounting german politicians are calling for auditors to be placed under stricter control and for the federal supervisory authorities to be given increased powers to avoid the accounting problems plaguing american corporations .

libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .
even reputed rogues should be given the right to redeem themselves - better late than never . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya to give up weapons program after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy .

libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .
even reputed rogues should be given the right to redeem themselves - better late than never . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya to give up weapons program after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .

the currency ’ s appreciation helped keep costs down , and retailers were less likely to raise prices with consumers reducing their spending .
the inflation rate fell to 1.1 percent from 1.3 percent in november , according to federal statistics .
prices rose 0.8 percent in the month , mostly on the back of higher package-tour prices and vacation home rents ahead of the christmas holidays .

"
referring to the intergovernmental negotiations on the constitution , cowen said , " ireland will place the highest responsibility on its igc responsibilities . "
that job has been made more difficult by the fact that in the last stages of bilateral negotiations at the dec .
12 summit , it was not clear exactly what compromises were agreed by each member state .
for the moment , the irish presidency will consult other member states and make a report which will be presented to eu leaders at a summit in march .
cowen would not speculate on whether the constitution talks could be finished within his presidency saying only that ireland " was not part of the disagreement that took place . "
in addition to the constitution , the irish have many other issues on their plate .
they will have to contend with talk about some member states going it alone at a faster pace than the rest .
the bad feeling between member states was exacerbated recently by a letter sent by six net contributors to the eu budget - france , germany , sweden , austria , the netherlands and the uk - demanding that it be curbed from 2007 .
other important issues it will have to deal with include overseeing a smooth enlargement on may 1 , taking forward membership negotiations for bulgaria and romania and reviving the eu 's flagging lisbon agenda which aims to revitalize europe 's economy by 2010 .

"
referring to the intergovernmental negotiations on the constitution , cowen said , " ireland will place the highest responsibility on its igc responsibilities . "
that job has been made more difficult by the fact that in the last stages of bilateral negotiations at the dec .
12 summit , it was not clear exactly what compromises were agreed by each member state .
for the moment , the irish presidency will consult other member states and make a report which will be presented to eu leaders at a summit in march .
cowen would not speculate on whether the constitution talks could be finished within his presidency saying only that ireland " was not part of the disagreement that took place . "
in addition to the constitution , the irish have many other issues on their plate .
they will have to contend with talk about some member states going it alone at a faster pace than the rest .
the bad feeling between member states was exacerbated recently by a letter sent by six net contributors to the eu budget - france , germany , sweden , austria , the netherlands and the uk - demanding that it be curbed from 2007 .
other important issues it will have to deal with include overseeing a smooth enlargement on may 1 , taking forward membership negotiations for bulgaria and romania and reviving the eu 's flagging lisbon agenda which aims to revitalize europe 's economy by 2010 .

until the constitution is adopted by the member states , the eu will continue to work on the basis of the nice treaty .
spanish prime minister josé maria aznar , whose country is in favor of keeping the weighted voting methods set in the nice treaty and blocked introducing reforms as desired by germany and france , has indicated his country is open to fresh negotiations .
" i hope and believe that an agreement is possible before the end of 2004 , " aznar told the italian daily corriere della sera on sunday .
he added that spain is flexible but " if we 're told to take it or leave it , then a deal will become difficult " .
german chancellor gerhard schröder indicated during over the weekend that he would put pressure on ireland to announce a deadline for an agreement during irish eu presidency , starting on jan .
1 , 2004 .
" i expect that the eu constitution will be unanimously agreed in the next year , " said schröder in an interview , though " not in the first quarter " .
in the mean time , the architect of europe 's draft constitution , french statesman valéry giscard d 'estaing , has urged member states to take their time in trying to restart the stalled talks .
" a good time would be the end of 2004 or the beginning of 2005 , " he said .
" a hasty movement will only reinforce the antagonism . "

referring to the strong spanish economic growth in contrast with the low french performance , aznar was quoted by financial times saying : " i would add the two speeds of a europe that is growing and a europe that is not growing " .
the ' core europe , ' made up of an axis of six countries , is seen by some as an alternative for european integration in the absence of a constitution .
but not all support the notion .
the prime minister of luxembourg , jean-claude juncker has called the idea " premature " and said it is not a goal in itself . italy , too , is cool towards the core-europe ideas .
quoted by the parisian daily les echos , italian foreign minister franco frattini said : " i think , it would not be in the spirit of the founding countries , to set up an axis of six countries , which would be seen by the rest as cutting europe into two parts . "

referring to the strong spanish economic growth in contrast with the low french performance , aznar was quoted by financial times saying : " i would add the two speeds of a europe that is growing and a europe that is not growing " .
the ' core europe , ' made up of an axis of six countries , is seen by some as an alternative for european integration in the absence of a constitution .
but not all support the notion .
the prime minister of luxembourg , jean-claude juncker has called the idea " premature " and said it is not a goal in itself . italy , too , is cool towards the core-europe ideas .
quoted by the parisian daily les echos , italian foreign minister franco frattini said : " i think , it would not be in the spirit of the founding countries , to set up an axis of six countries , which would be seen by the rest as cutting europe into two parts . "

a pilot project in germany is training refugees to be “ language and culture mediators , ” with the aim of helping other refugees adjust to their new homeland . for many people , a visit to the doctor can be intimidating .
the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .

she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .

a pilot project in germany is training refugees to be “ language and culture mediators , ” with the aim of helping other refugees adjust to their new homeland . for many people , a visit to the doctor can be intimidating .
the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .

since germany is a secular state , employees in the public sector , including teachers , should not be allowed to wear headscarves , schröder said in an interview with the newspaper bild am sonntag .
the chancellor added that students on the other hand could not be forced to take off their headscarves .
each of germany ’ s 16 federal states should deal with the issue individually , schröder said .
bavaria and baden-württemberg have already put in place a ban on headscarves for teachers after germany ’ s constitutional court allowed this recently .
other states have said they plan to follow suit . dw-world.de high court rules headscarves okay for teachers although germany ’ s constitutional law does not explicitly forbid the wearing of headscarves in public schools , states can legally enact such a ban .

referring to the strong spanish economic growth in contrast with the low french performance , aznar was quoted by financial times saying : " i would add the two speeds of a europe that is growing and a europe that is not growing " .
the ' core europe , ' made up of an axis of six countries , is seen by some as an alternative for european integration in the absence of a constitution .
but not all support the notion .
the prime minister of luxembourg , jean-claude juncker has called the idea " premature " and said it is not a goal in itself . italy , too , is cool towards the core-europe ideas .
quoted by the parisian daily les echos , italian foreign minister franco frattini said : " i think , it would not be in the spirit of the founding countries , to set up an axis of six countries , which would be seen by the rest as cutting europe into two parts . "

casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .
that led to the firms founder and chairman calisto tanzi to surprisingly hand over control to enrico bondi , a man with a reputation for turning around troubled businesses . bondi is now likely to file for protection from creditors as he tries to get the company 's books in order .
according to the reuters news agency , bondi was to meet with italian industry minister antonio marzano to discuss how to proceed . italian prosecutors are now also involved to determine the extent of criminal activity such as fraud .
along with the company ’ s auditors , grant thornton and deloitte & touche , ex-finance director fausto tonna will come in for considerable scrutiny . some italian newspapers had reported that tonna had fled to venezuela , but reuters spoke to him by telephone in collecchio , near parma .

casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .
that led to the firms founder and chairman calisto tanzi to surprisingly hand over control to enrico bondi , a man with a reputation for turning around troubled businesses . bondi is now likely to file for protection from creditors as he tries to get the company 's books in order .
according to the reuters news agency , bondi was to meet with italian industry minister antonio marzano to discuss how to proceed . italian prosecutors are now also involved to determine the extent of criminal activity such as fraud .

the answer is yes - especially if they like cars . stuttgart , home to luxury carmakers mercedes-benz and porsche , doesn ’ t have the gritty feel that one might associate with a motor city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.12.2003 with space program , europe looks to mars and earth back to first page back 2/2 bildunterschrift : the esa launcher programme is looking to the future , to make sure that it is ready to meet new needs and promote european access to space .
at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urope 's laboratory on the international space station in terms of the international space station , we are also preparing the columbus european research laboratory module as well as the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- support module -lrb- see illustration at top of story -rrb- , which will be transported by ariane rockets .
the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .
the dominant question is always how can we utilize it ?
as i indicated , esa and dlr are focusing more on earth observation . bildunterschrift : torgau : vergleich , 14 .

we were able to use our own space technology to monitor the recent flooding in france and eastern germany as well as the wildfires in california and the peat fires in china .
these technologies enable us to pinpoint the origins of a natural disaster , what the growth of the disaster is and where you have to put measures in place that can be most effectively utilized .
with fires , if you can identify the center and the highest intensity , then you know where you need to do certain things .
those are just some of the ways in which we seek to differentiate ourselves from other space programs . interview conducted by daryl lindsey back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy . in a surprise announcement on friday , libya admitted to producing weapons of mass destruction but agreed to scrap the program and submit to international inspections .
the announcement came after nine months of secret negotiations between great britain and libya and marks the latest in a series of efforts by the government in tripoli – in the face of mounting pressure on “ rogue states ” – to rehabilitate its image . tony blair rushed before the cameras on friday to praise the decision , heralding it as a sign that disputes over weapons of mass destruction , as opposed to the outcome in iraq , could be resolved peacefully .
“ it shows that problems of proliferation can , with good will , be tackled through discussion and engagement , ” blair said . bush also reacted positively and dangled the carrot of improved relations between libya and the united states .
“ as the libyan government takes these essential steps and demonstrates its seriousness , its good faith will be returned .
libya can regain a secure and respected place among the nations over time , and achieve far better relations with the united states , ” he said . but when bush says “ over time ” , he means it .
administration officials told reuters that the sanctions currently imposed on libya will remain in place until further notice .
“ we will work with them as long as they are genuine in their initiative .
we ’ re not at the point of discussing how this affects the sanctions regime , ” said the official . so what exactly will the libyans be giving up ?
according to experts , libya has ten questionable sites which are believed to be devoted to the development and production of chemical and biological weapons .
and libya is believed to have been close to attaining nuclear capability . libya looks to rehabilitate image for much of the past year , libya has been inching closer towards rejoining the international community and shaking off its pariah status .
in august , the united nations lifted international sanctions after libya officially accepted responsibility for the bombing of a pan am airplane over lockerbie , scotland in 1988 and agreed to pay retributions .
in a strange overlap , this latest announcement came two days before the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing on sunday . following the iraq war , the decision to rejoin the international community represents one of two avenues currently available to rogue leaders in possession of secret and illegal weapons programs .
after observing the fate of saddam hussein , libya ’ s leader , col. moammar gadhafi , decided to take a different route and submit to international inspections .
what ’ s more , if and when us sanctions are lifted , he has a lot to gain , and that , appears to have been , partly , what motivated him to change course . on saturday , minister mohamed abderrhmane chalgam , libya ’ s foreign minister , told al jazeera television that his government was hoping to get back into the good graces of britain and the united states .
“ libya wants to solve all problems and we want to focus on development and advancing our country , ” he said .
“ we want to have ties with america and britain because this is in the interest of our people . ” another victory for european diplomacy the outcome in libya signals another victory for european diplomacy in dealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
while the us has opted to take a heavy handed approach with iraq , many governments in europe , including germany and france , have chosen to engage isolationist countries with a carrot and stick approach . in october , foreign ministers from europe ’ s big three – great britain , france and germany – travelled to iran and successfully convinced iranian officials to agree to nuclear inspections .
libya ’ s decision may send a message to north korea , which remains defiant despite mounting international pressure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran agrees to inspections after eu talks the foreign ministers of europe 's big three - great britain , france and germany - breathed a sigh of relief when iranian officials agreed to nuclear inspections after a tense day of talks .

after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy . in a surprise announcement on friday , libya admitted to producing weapons of mass destruction but agreed to scrap the program and submit to international inspections .
the announcement came after nine months of secret negotiations between great britain and libya and marks the latest in a series of efforts by the government in tripoli – in the face of mounting pressure on “ rogue states ” – to rehabilitate its image . tony blair rushed before the cameras on friday to praise the decision , heralding it as a sign that disputes over weapons of mass destruction , as opposed to the outcome in iraq , could be resolved peacefully .
“ it shows that problems of proliferation can , with good will , be tackled through discussion and engagement , ” blair said . bush also reacted positively and dangled the carrot of improved relations between libya and the united states .
“ as the libyan government takes these essential steps and demonstrates its seriousness , its good faith will be returned .
libya can regain a secure and respected place among the nations over time , and achieve far better relations with the united states , ” he said . but when bush says “ over time ” , he means it .
administration officials told reuters that the sanctions currently imposed on libya will remain in place until further notice .
“ we will work with them as long as they are genuine in their initiative .
we ’ re not at the point of discussing how this affects the sanctions regime , ” said the official . so what exactly will the libyans be giving up ?
according to experts , libya has ten questionable sites which are believed to be devoted to the development and production of chemical and biological weapons .
and libya is believed to have been close to attaining nuclear capability . libya looks to rehabilitate image for much of the past year , libya has been inching closer towards rejoining the international community and shaking off its pariah status .
in august , the united nations lifted international sanctions after libya officially accepted responsibility for the bombing of a pan am airplane over lockerbie , scotland in 1988 and agreed to pay retributions .
in a strange overlap , this latest announcement came two days before the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing on sunday . following the iraq war , the decision to rejoin the international community represents one of two avenues currently available to rogue leaders in possession of secret and illegal weapons programs .
after observing the fate of saddam hussein , libya ’ s leader , col. moammar gadhafi , decided to take a different route and submit to international inspections .

dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .

in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .

dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?

dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .

the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urope 's laboratory on the international space station in terms of the international space station , we are also preparing the columbus european research laboratory module as well as the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- support module -lrb- see illustration at top of story -rrb- , which will be transported by ariane rockets .
the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .
the dominant question is always how can we utilize it ?

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .

the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .

the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy . in a surprise announcement on friday , libya admitted to producing weapons of mass destruction but agreed to scrap the program and submit to international inspections .
the announcement came after nine months of secret negotiations between great britain and libya and marks the latest in a series of efforts by the government in tripoli – in the face of mounting pressure on “ rogue states ” – to rehabilitate its image . tony blair rushed before the cameras on friday to praise the decision , heralding it as a sign that disputes over weapons of mass destruction , as opposed to the outcome in iraq , could be resolved peacefully .
“ it shows that problems of proliferation can , with good will , be tackled through discussion and engagement , ” blair said . bush also reacted positively and dangled the carrot of improved relations between libya and the united states .
“ as the libyan government takes these essential steps and demonstrates its seriousness , its good faith will be returned .
libya can regain a secure and respected place among the nations over time , and achieve far better relations with the united states , ” he said . but when bush says “ over time ” , he means it .
administration officials told reuters that the sanctions currently imposed on libya will remain in place until further notice .
“ we will work with them as long as they are genuine in their initiative .
we ’ re not at the point of discussing how this affects the sanctions regime , ” said the official . so what exactly will the libyans be giving up ?
according to experts , libya has ten questionable sites which are believed to be devoted to the development and production of chemical and biological weapons .
and libya is believed to have been close to attaining nuclear capability . libya looks to rehabilitate image for much of the past year , libya has been inching closer towards rejoining the international community and shaking off its pariah status .
in august , the united nations lifted international sanctions after libya officially accepted responsibility for the bombing of a pan am airplane over lockerbie , scotland in 1988 and agreed to pay retributions .
in a strange overlap , this latest announcement came two days before the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing on sunday . following the iraq war , the decision to rejoin the international community represents one of two avenues currently available to rogue leaders in possession of secret and illegal weapons programs .
after observing the fate of saddam hussein , libya ’ s leader , col. moammar gadhafi , decided to take a different route and submit to international inspections .
what ’ s more , if and when us sanctions are lifted , he has a lot to gain , and that , appears to have been , partly , what motivated him to change course . on saturday , minister mohamed abderrhmane chalgam , libya ’ s foreign minister , told al jazeera television that his government was hoping to get back into the good graces of britain and the united states .
“ libya wants to solve all problems and we want to focus on development and advancing our country , ” he said .
“ we want to have ties with america and britain because this is in the interest of our people . ” another victory for european diplomacy the outcome in libya signals another victory for european diplomacy in dealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
while the us has opted to take a heavy handed approach with iraq , many governments in europe , including germany and france , have chosen to engage isolationist countries with a carrot and stick approach . in october , foreign ministers from europe ’ s big three – great britain , france and germany – travelled to iran and successfully convinced iranian officials to agree to nuclear inspections .

after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy . in a surprise announcement on friday , libya admitted to producing weapons of mass destruction but agreed to scrap the program and submit to international inspections .
the announcement came after nine months of secret negotiations between great britain and libya and marks the latest in a series of efforts by the government in tripoli – in the face of mounting pressure on “ rogue states ” – to rehabilitate its image . tony blair rushed before the cameras on friday to praise the decision , heralding it as a sign that disputes over weapons of mass destruction , as opposed to the outcome in iraq , could be resolved peacefully .
“ it shows that problems of proliferation can , with good will , be tackled through discussion and engagement , ” blair said . bush also reacted positively and dangled the carrot of improved relations between libya and the united states .
“ as the libyan government takes these essential steps and demonstrates its seriousness , its good faith will be returned .
libya can regain a secure and respected place among the nations over time , and achieve far better relations with the united states , ” he said . but when bush says “ over time ” , he means it .
administration officials told reuters that the sanctions currently imposed on libya will remain in place until further notice .
“ we will work with them as long as they are genuine in their initiative .
we ’ re not at the point of discussing how this affects the sanctions regime , ” said the official . so what exactly will the libyans be giving up ?
according to experts , libya has ten questionable sites which are believed to be devoted to the development and production of chemical and biological weapons .
and libya is believed to have been close to attaining nuclear capability . libya looks to rehabilitate image for much of the past year , libya has been inching closer towards rejoining the international community and shaking off its pariah status .
in august , the united nations lifted international sanctions after libya officially accepted responsibility for the bombing of a pan am airplane over lockerbie , scotland in 1988 and agreed to pay retributions .
in a strange overlap , this latest announcement came two days before the fifteenth anniversary of the bombing on sunday . following the iraq war , the decision to rejoin the international community represents one of two avenues currently available to rogue leaders in possession of secret and illegal weapons programs .
after observing the fate of saddam hussein , libya ’ s leader , col. moammar gadhafi , decided to take a different route and submit to international inspections .
what ’ s more , if and when us sanctions are lifted , he has a lot to gain , and that , appears to have been , partly , what motivated him to change course . on saturday , minister mohamed abderrhmane chalgam , libya ’ s foreign minister , told al jazeera television that his government was hoping to get back into the good graces of britain and the united states .
“ libya wants to solve all problems and we want to focus on development and advancing our country , ” he said .
“ we want to have ties with america and britain because this is in the interest of our people . ” another victory for european diplomacy the outcome in libya signals another victory for european diplomacy in dealing with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
while the us has opted to take a heavy handed approach with iraq , many governments in europe , including germany and france , have chosen to engage isolationist countries with a carrot and stick approach . in october , foreign ministers from europe ’ s big three – great britain , france and germany – travelled to iran and successfully convinced iranian officials to agree to nuclear inspections .
libya ’ s decision may send a message to north korea , which remains defiant despite mounting international pressure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran agrees to inspections after eu talks the foreign ministers of europe 's big three - great britain , france and germany - breathed a sigh of relief when iranian officials agreed to nuclear inspections after a tense day of talks .

there are many who say that the heart of the east german resistance movement lay in leipzig .
the regular prayer services and demonstrations that took place every monday at the nikolaikirche in the autumn of 1989 had a knock-on effect , inspiring similar peaceful protests in the capital berlin .

libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .
even reputed rogues should be given the right to redeem themselves - better late than never . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya to give up weapons program after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .

in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .

there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .

casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .
that led to the firms founder and chairman calisto tanzi to surprisingly hand over control to enrico bondi , a man with a reputation for turning around troubled businesses . bondi is now likely to file for protection from creditors as he tries to get the company 's books in order .
according to the reuters news agency , bondi was to meet with italian industry minister antonio marzano to discuss how to proceed . italian prosecutors are now also involved to determine the extent of criminal activity such as fraud .
along with the company ’ s auditors , grant thornton and deloitte & touche , ex-finance director fausto tonna will come in for considerable scrutiny . some italian newspapers had reported that tonna had fled to venezuela , but reuters spoke to him by telephone in collecchio , near parma .
“ i 've not run off anywhere , ” he said , adding he had not yet been contacted by justice officials . he declined to comment on the € 4-billion hole in parmalat 's accounts . with material from wire reports -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties call for war on creative accounting german politicians are calling for auditors to be placed under stricter control and for the federal supervisory authorities to be given increased powers to avoid the accounting problems plaguing american corporations .

casting new doubt on european corporate governance , leading italian food group parmalat announced last week the firm had a € 4-billion discrepancy in its books .
the accounting scandal is already being compared to enron . parmalat , one of the world ’ s biggest dairy companies and a key part of corporate italy , shocked the country on friday by admitting € 3.95 billion -lrb- $ 4.89 billion -rrb- supposedly held by its bonlat financing unit in the cayman islands did not exist . with reports circulating on monday that the actual sum missing could be much higher , the scandal will easily overtake the € 1 billion bookkeeping shenanigans at dutch retailer ahold .
that would add credence to analogies that parmalat has become “ europe ’ s enron , ” a reference to the failed u.s. energy giant which has become the leading example of bad accounting par excellence . over the weekend , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi called the events at parmalat “ almost incredible , ” but said rome would do what was necessary to save as many of the company ’ s 35,000 jobs as possible . “ the government will intervene in order to secure the operating part of the firm and protect its jobs , ” berlusconi said .
as italy 's eighth-largest company , active in more than 30 countries around the world , the economic impact of a parmalat collapse would be considerable . opaque structure long known for its opaque structure and penchant for complicated financing , the extent of parmalat ’ s troubles started to emerge earlier this month after it failed to pay back a € 150 million bond on time despite supposedly having € 4.2 billion of liquidity on its balance sheet .
that led to the firms founder and chairman calisto tanzi to surprisingly hand over control to enrico bondi , a man with a reputation for turning around troubled businesses . bondi is now likely to file for protection from creditors as he tries to get the company 's books in order .
according to the reuters news agency , bondi was to meet with italian industry minister antonio marzano to discuss how to proceed . italian prosecutors are now also involved to determine the extent of criminal activity such as fraud .
along with the company ’ s auditors , grant thornton and deloitte & touche , ex-finance director fausto tonna will come in for considerable scrutiny . some italian newspapers had reported that tonna had fled to venezuela , but reuters spoke to him by telephone in collecchio , near parma .

a pilot project in germany is training refugees to be “ language and culture mediators , ” with the aim of helping other refugees adjust to their new homeland . for many people , a visit to the doctor can be intimidating .
the atmosphere is sterile ; painful tests may be involved , and the medical terminology is off-putting . imagine , then , how uncomfortable it could be to visit a doctor when you don ’ t even speak the language . alusine sesay came from sierra leone to germany in 1999 , and recalls his first doctors ’ visit .
“ there was a language problem between me and the doctor . i couldn ’ t explain what my problem was .
i was completely alone .
but the doctor tried to understand me .
the situation was very odd for me , very strange . ” germany plays " catch up " situations like this occur daily for the more than seven million immigrants in germany .
they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .
second , it gives those who finish the training and become “ mediators ” by the end of their studies , in 2005 , a chance to make it in their new homeland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de homegrown net café reconnects refugees , families unable to afford calls to their homelands , an enterprising group of asylum seekers in potsdam set up their own internet café .

they enter the country looking for better living and work conditions , and for a new homeland .
but few of them speak german .
when they need to go to the immigration office or to the hospital , they are helpless unless they find a friend or relative that can go with them and translate for them . now , a pilot project in wuppertal , in north rhine-westphalia , is training a group of 26 people - who are themselves asylum seekers - to become what is known as “ language and culture mediators . ”
that is , people who would be assigned to help immigrants negotiate german bureaucracy upon their arrival . varinia morales is the head of the training program -lrb- called transspuk because of the german acronym for “ transfer of speech and culture ” -rrb- .
she explains that while elsewhere in europe , “ in switzerland , holland , austria , england , italy , the job of language and culture mediator is already recognized ” since the early 1990s , germany is “ just playing catch-up ” now . in the countries where they are currently used , mediators help immigrants and refugees make various official visits where , due to their language and cultural backgrounds , “ there could be misunderstandings , which could in turn lead to their not being able to take advantage of the services .
in germany , we are just starting to deal with this problem . ” no visa , no work permit normally , asylum seekers are excluded from job training schemes in germany .
but since the middle of 2002 , wuppertal has offered the three-year program , which is supported financially by the european union .
but there 's still a sticking point : the program isn ’ t yet accredited by german authorities . people enrolled in the program take seminars on how germany ’ s social system and bureaucracy function , as well as learning the most important computer programs , and german cultural singularities .
and of course , they learn the german language . the students are generally from crisis regions such as kosovo and afghanistan , sierra leone and iran .
in their home countries , they may have worked as teachers , architects , economists or engineers .
but in germany they have no long-term visa , and thus no work permit . yet despite all the uncertainties , they see the job training as giving them a chance of finding a job in germany . shahram ghadery , who left iran eight years ago , was a schoolteacher there .
but , he notes , “ i have no chance to teach school -lrb- in germany -rrb- – that is clear .
when i came to germany i wanted to study , but it didn ’ t work out .
this training is the only thing i can do . i ’ m happy about it , but it ’ s the only thing available for me .
and i hope that will change , that other asylum seekers can eventually do other jobs . ” difficult conditions students generally do the training under difficult conditions , morales says .
after class , they return to their residences , mostly in homes for asylum seekers , where they often share rooms with strangers .
many still suffer from the traumatic conditions of fleeing their native countries .
and none of the 26 students involved knows how long they will be able to remain in germany . “ you have to keep in mind , these people are refugees and asylum seekers who only have a temporary visa status .
these people aren ’ t recognized .
their cases are under adjudication and they can be sent out of the country at any point , ” morales says but if it works out - if it gets accreditation and if the services become standard offerings for asylum seekers , then the wuppertal project will meet two goals at one time .
first , it will help new asylum seekers to integrate .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

but the city also hopes the upbeat saying will give it a boost toward achieving its past glory as an illustrious center of trade , publishing and science . much still needs to be done - leipzig has more construction projects underway than anywhere else in germany except berlin .
but the saxon city nonetheless holds its own as a major cultural and intellectual center , and an attractive one , at that .
looks matter if first impressions are important , then those arriving by rail will no doubt be impressed by leipzig .
the central station is one of the most beautiful and modern railway terminals in europe .
from the station , it 's just a few strides to the historic town center , most of it faithfully restored after large-scale destruction in world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : j.s. bach was cantor in leipzig 's thomaskirche for many years highlights of a stroll in this picturesque district are the old city hall and its ' newer ' counterpart -lrb- although ' new ' in this case means well over a century old -rrb- , the market square and the church of st. thomas , which dates from the late 15th century .
with a population of half a million , leipzig has all the amenities of a large city without the disorienting sprawl .
shops , banks , theaters , cinemas , restaurants , the university - all can be reached on foot .
university town leipzig university was founded almost 600 years ago , making leipzig one of germany 's oldest university towns .
it is still one of europe 's most highly respected seats of learning , and attracts some 24,000 students to follow a variety of courses .
business and trade-related degrees have long since been added to the science faculty course list - a fact no doubt related to leipzig 's long-standing tradition as a trading center .
capitalizing on its geographical position as a gateway between east the west , leipzig has hosted key international trade fairs for more than 800 years , making it a gathering point for people from all over europe .
in 1497 its two annual markets , at easter and at michaelmas , were promoted to the rank of " imperial fair . "
today , leipzig 's trade fairs are held in the neue messe , or new fairground .
perhaps the most prominent event held there is the annual book fair , which sees some 2,000 publishing companies from around the world presenting their wares .

there are many who say that the heart of the east german resistance movement lay in leipzig .
the regular prayer services and demonstrations that took place every monday at the nikolaikirche in the autumn of 1989 had a knock-on effect , inspiring similar peaceful protests in the capital berlin .
these eventually led to the fall of the berlin wall in november of that year , and the subsequent downfall of the east german communist regime .
bach , mendelssohn & co .
leipzig residents have a special fondness for the church of st. thomas , where theologian and reformer martin luther held sermons - just 50 kilometers from the town of wittenberg , where he nailed his 95 theses protesting the papal bull to the church door in 1517 .
the act eventually led to the founding of the protestant church . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the basement pub auerbach 's keller was made famous in goethe 's " faust " over 100 years later , the church achieved great fame yet again , as the place where a certain cantor called johann sebastian bach worked , from 1723 until his death .
the church has housed bach 's tomb since 1950 .
the city 's gewandhaus concerts , which are still held to this day , were made famous by felix mendelssohn , who died here in 1847 .
as for the city 's claims to literary fame , the young goethe studied there in 1765 , and gottsched , gellert , and schiller - to name but a few - made leipzig a literary center in the 18th century .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

at present , one of the main deterrents to making more use of space is cost .
if ways can be found of reducing these costs then new users and uses for satellites could be found for the benefit of europeans and european industry .
this is why esa ’ s future launchers programme is important .
its job is to develop , assess and demonstrate the technical solutions needed for future launchers , and ensure that quality and safety are mantained .
ideas for cheaper ways of putting satellites into space , using a reusable launch vehicle , are under review by esa and europe ’ s aerospace industry .
-lrb- future launchers -rrb- how do you see the european space program developing after this mission ? might the esa launch manned space flights ?
the next step will be launching the rosetta probe next year , which we hope will visit a comet .
we are also working closely together with our american colleagues on human space flight – esa and dlr are very well linked with nasa .
then earth observation is one of the dominant questions in europe .
take , for example , the whole navigational question .
we ’ re trying to start the galileo system to compete with the american gps navigation system .
other areas include looking at what is happening on the planet – weather forecasts , natural disasters etc .
one mission we have undertaken in germany is the bird satellite , which looks at fires on the earth ’ s surface .
we are also working on future launchers , which are used for taking payloads and satellites into space , and what they will look like .
but first we have to continue working on ariana , our satellite launching system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urope 's laboratory on the international space station in terms of the international space station , we are also preparing the columbus european research laboratory module as well as the automated transfer vehicle -lrb- atv -rrb- support module -lrb- see illustration at top of story -rrb- , which will be transported by ariane rockets .
the columbus is a research module which will attach to the space station and allow scientists to conduct research in a zero gravity setting - it is the esa 's biggest contribution to the iss thus far .
but we ’ re particularly excited about the atv , because it will help close the gaps if the space shuttle is not flying .
we recently had to reduce the number of astronauts on the iss to two because the shuttle was grounded and there was no way to provide three with enough supplies .
separating the transport of humans and goods is the way to go in the future .
still , the iss can ’ t live without the space shuttle .
the esa ’ s columbia module and other major components have been designed specifically for transport in the shuttle ’ s cargo bay and they can ’ t be transported until the shuttles are flying again .
how do you view esa ’ s position in relation to nasa ?
do you see yourselves as competitors ?
we obviously do have friendly competition , that ’ s the scientific basis .
we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .

the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .

these technologies enable us to pinpoint the origins of a natural disaster , what the growth of the disaster is and where you have to put measures in place that can be most effectively utilized .
with fires , if you can identify the center and the highest intensity , then you know where you need to do certain things .
those are just some of the ways in which we seek to differentiate ourselves from other space programs . interview conducted by daryl lindsey back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

settled in a lush valley of the swabian mountains on the edge of the black forest , it is home to vast parklands and famous vineyards .
the capital of swabia , stuttgart is known for its strong dialect , distinct food , and its history of tinkering and inventing - something the rest of the country cherishes . swabians fit the german image of being punctual , industrious , clean and house-proud .
whether its earned or not , they have the reputation of being thrifty .
stuttgart has been called " the city where work is a pleasure . "

the mercedes-benz museum and the porsche museum are full of sexy cars and the newest and oldest prototypes , and even people who don ’ t fall in the " gear head " category will enjoy a visit . stuttgart has more to offer than just cars , though .
the classical staatsgalerie -lrb- state gallery -rrb- hosts one of germany ’ s greatest art collections , with impressive works by picasso , giacometti and klee collected in a remarkably postmodern building designed by british architect james stirling . interested in dance and theatre ?
the stuttgart opera house offers excellent ballet performances and musicals . if the weather is too nice for a museum visit , the palace gardens is an ideal place to soak up the sun .
the four kilometer greenway is filled with winding walkways , fountains , sculptures , a planetarium - and the daring stuttgarters who opt for leisure over more productive pursuits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not into cars ?
then head for the theater at the north end of the park is the rosenstein garden , at the head of which lies the rosenstein castle , now the natural history museum .
further north is the wilhelma zoo and botanical gardens , created originally as a moorish garden by king wilhelm i in the 19th century . take a hike stuttgart can be a pleasure to see on foot - especially if you are in good shape .
a workout is guaranteed , as stuttgart streets are steep , with over 500 of them turning into staircases . a great option for urban trekkers is the city circuit walk that starts at the central train station .
it takes about two hours - but leave time to take in the many bars , cafes , exclusive shops , boutiques and bookstores -lrb- stuttgart boasts the highest per-capita number of bookstores in germany . -rrb-
for trekkers with a taste for wine , there are over 500 vineyards in the near vicinity , and the green crests of vine-covered hills can be seen from the city center .
walkers can access some 53 kilometers -lrb- 33 miles -rrb- of interconnected hiking trails directly from town by following the trail emblem , a yellow circle around a horse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : be sure to taste a giant , soft " bretzel " want to check out the surroundings without the cardiovascular workout ?
then try a boat ride down the meandering neckar river . those content not to move about at all could settle in at one of stuttgart ’ s famed mineral springs .
saunas and bathhouses are common all over germany and have been steadily growing in popularity over the past two decades .
but stuttgart ’ s two main spas - bad cannstatt and bad leuze - have lured visitors and royals alike for over 200 years .
both offer relaxation seekers hot and cold mineral baths , saunas , hot tubs and swimming pools .
re-fuel with local specialties if all the sightseeing has left you hungry , it may be time for a taste of stuttgart ’ s number one snack : the pretzel .
not to be confused with the small , dried packaged pretzels known to outsiders , german pretzels are enormous twists of soft , fresh dough , normally served with butter , and often eaten for breakfast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stop for a cappuccino in one of stuttgart 's street cafes other typically swabian foods are spätzle - a homely , eggy noodle combined with a cheese or a meat sauce - and maultaschen , the german version of ravioli .
gaisburger marsch , a thick stew of beef , potatoes , spätzle , and vegetables , is also often found on menus . with so many great vineyards nearby , stuttgart is known for its wine , and wine lovers flock to the city during the 10-day weindorf wine festival -lrb- august / september -rrb- , where hundreds of local vintners display their goods . party time yet the grape doesn ’ t displace beer in this town .
the cannstatter volksfest is the second largest beer festival in germany , after munich 's oktoberfest .
it takes place in late september , and is a mixture of country fair and beer festival . stuttgarters are big music fans and the city has become the birthplace for german hip-hop .
out of its love for music come the eclat new music festival -lrb- january / february -rrb- which celebrates avant-garde music .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .
there has also been considerable transfer in the areas of light-weight materials , navigational systems , optical systems , like our high resolution cameras , fire detection systems and robotics . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european probe closes in on mars after journeying six months and 400 million kilometers , the european space agency 's mars express began its final approach to the red planet , where it will look for signs of water and life .

we want to be the first to find out certain things .
on the other hand , we also cooperate closely .
i mentioned the international space station .
the united states is obviously the dominant force in the program , but we are cooperating really closely with them – both through esa and our national programs .
the german space agency funds 41 percent of the european contributions to the iss .
when you look at europe and its space ambitions , how do they differ from those of china , russia or the u.s. ?
the u.s. has a really broad program , but it focuses even more strongly than we do on human space flight and space exploration .
china is emerging as a strong power and they are now also focusing on human space flight .
i suspect they will also concentrate on earth observation .
this is a natural interest for large countries that are seeking to monitor crops , weather or even natural disasters .
the dominant question is always how can we utilize it ?
as i indicated , esa and dlr are focusing more on earth observation . bildunterschrift : torgau : vergleich , 14 .

we were able to use our own space technology to monitor the recent flooding in france and eastern germany as well as the wildfires in california and the peat fires in china .
these technologies enable us to pinpoint the origins of a natural disaster , what the growth of the disaster is and where you have to put measures in place that can be most effectively utilized .
with fires , if you can identify the center and the highest intensity , then you know where you need to do certain things .

libya 's leader , moammar gadhafi , has done an about face , and agreed to give up his weapons of mass destruction .
but the case of libya is different from that of iran and north korea , argues peter philipp . it seems moammar gadhafi , the president of libya , has managed a u-turn in the 34th year of his dictatorship .
after he unexpectedly agreed to stop producing weapons of mass destruction and submit to unlimited international inspections on friday , a wayward pariah , as he is considered and handled by many including some of his arab neighbors , is attempting to emerge as an honorable member of the international community . the announcement from tripoli came just one day after iran signed the additional protocol of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in vienna , thereby succumbing to mounting international pressure that seems to have irritated some leaders in teheran .
in libya , the opposite is the case .
british and american emissaries negotiated for nine months with gadhafi without word leaking out .
and the negotiations came at the personal initiative of gadhafi himself .
in march , at the start of the war in iraq , the libyan leader approached washington and london and asked them to subject his country to stricter controls . britain and america are celebrating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with gadhafi , as well they should .
they are glorifying him as an example for other " rogue states , " who they expect to follow gadhafi 's example .
but , in the case of iran , things are very different .
for years teheran has granted inspectors from the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- access , while continuing to secretly work on diverse prohibited programs without managing to develop weapons ready for operation .
north korea is another case .
there , such weapons exist , or could be produced quickly .
in libya , by contrast , these weapons , with the exception of a few chemical weapons that gadhafi is said to have employed in chad years ago , do not exist - at least that 's how international weapons experts assess the situation . libya , despite gadhafi 's at times bizarre politics and his admitted involvement in international terrorism in the past , no longer represents a threat .
and as proud as britian and america are of their " negotiated success , " one should be just as proud of every land that resists the temptation to develop weapons of mass destruction and swears them off . in the case of libya , this did not happen because gadhafi transformed himself from saul to paul , but because he realized he could not otherwise deliver his country from the economic misery it has suffered since its role in the bombing of a plane over lockerbie and a disco in berlin . in august , libya took responsibility for lockerbie and the bombing of a french airliner and paid retributions , and the united nations lifted its sanctions .
if he signs the additional protocol to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , so it would seem gadhafi 's calculations go , the us would also lift its sanctions and invest in libya .
that is what 's likely to happen , and that is how it should be .
even reputed rogues should be given the right to redeem themselves - better late than never . peter philipp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya to give up weapons program after months of secret negotiations with britain , libya has agreed to scrap its weapons program .
this marks libya ’ s latest effort to rehabilitate its image and another victory for european diplomacy .

but even as history is made , scientists at the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the national space agencies throughout the 15-member consortium are busy creating blueprints for the future of space exploration .
dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .

dw-world recently sat down with sigmar wittig - chairman of the board of the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- , the agency that administers germany 's space program - to discuss the mars express and other major missions esa and dlr are planning for the future .
what is the importance of the mars express mission for the european space program ?
the scientific mission - to see whether there is water and life on mars - is of utmost importance .
from a german point of view , there are some instruments on mars express and on the beagle 2 that are significant .
there ’ s the high resolution stereo camera , which we expect will provide us with fantastic images and pictures that will help determine what the surface of mars looks like . this will be correlated with measurements taken off the martian surface and subsurface , to provide a highly accurate rendering of the planet .
meanwhile , the drill , or " mole , " is a tool developed by the german space agency that we ’ re using to go underneath the surface .
you can ’ t just draw martian soil samples on the surface because of the influence the outer atmosphere and space have on the planet ’ s surface .
we have to drill down almost 1.5 meters to see what the real soil looks like and , we hope , determine what it was like a million years ago . was there life on mars ?
is or was there water ?
does this mission signal an evolution in europe ’ s space program ?
this mission puts us in the first class of engineering accomplishments .
it also means we ’ ve got the highest-standard technology in many areas , including information and navigation .
are there any commercial benefits of the mission for germany and europe ?
the commercial aspect is not the most important one , but rather the scientific aspect .
if you look at the commercial side , certainly the high-resolution camera , for example , can also be used to take pictures of other planets and of the earth to check remote areas and provide a total view our planet useful for the purposes of continuing earth observation .
so there is a commercial aspect , but it ’ s not dominant .
nasa has long been admired for the technologies it has developed and later transferred to private industry ?
has there been any similar technology transfer from the european space program or germany ’ s space program ?
in the german context , a large amount of technology has been transferred from our space program .
higher temperature materials developed by the space program are used in industry as well as carbon materials , which can now be found in high-speed car brakes .
a lot of this came from german space research , including the work done to develop re-entry materials for the ariane launcher program .

madhur jaffrey is an actress , tv presenter and writer - but it is for her cookery that she is best known .
she was born in delhi , india .
she left the country at the age of 20 to come to britain .
i have an interesting reason for leaving .
i got an indian scholarship to begin with , for the theatre really , and my case to the indian government was that there were no schools that taught acting for the stage in india at that time - we 're talking mid-50s - and could i please use that scholarship abroad ?
i think somehow i was destined to be an international tree , and to pass on whatever my roots were feeding me to all kinds of other people i had a scholarship for two years , and then my dream was always to be another marlon brando .
i wanted to act , and i wanted to act in a certain style - which of course was to me in america .
here i was , a trained actress , and i had just won a huge award at the berlin international film festival as best actress .
i thought : " now my career is made . "
but no such thing happened , so i was here in the united states looking desperately for work and not getting work .
i had three little girls at that time , and i had to send them to school .
i said : " how am i going to do it ? "
and the only thing i know how to do , perhaps , is write .
so i started writing for magazines and newspapers , and i was writing about anything i knew anything about .
i also ventured to write about food - and somehow , food writing just took off .
when i wrote my first cookbook , i actually felt that i knew very little about cooking - i just started cooking at the age of 20 myself .
so what i said to my editor was that i was going to do a book on the food that i know , that i cook myself .
and what i know is the food of delhi .
that 's what my first book is - it 's pretty much all the recipes from my relatives , from my friends , in my city , the recipes i grew up with and that my mother sent to me in little air letters when i was a student at rada .
i very much doubt that i would have had a full-blown cooking career in india , because the way i was raised , we had cooks in our house , and the cooks cooked .
my mother would go in occasionally to supervise the food , but that was it .
i probably would have grown up not cooking on a regular basis - though of course it 's hard to know , but i tend to doubt it .
i do n't think i would go back and live in india now because i have kids and grandchildren who were raised in america .
i knew as a very young girl in india that i was destined to travel , destined to try and fulfil a lot of my ambitions .
i was n't quite clear what those ambitions were , but i knew they were going to take to a place where i would be with an international group as opposed to a national group .
one 's roots are terribly important - the word roots is roots , and that 's where the tree grows from .
but i think some people are destined to be national trees , and stay in the land of their birth , but i think somehow i was destined to be an international tree , and to pass on whatever my roots were feeding me onto all kinds of other people .
i just feel that i did n't choose any of this , but somehow it 's come about , and i have very few regrets about it .

when i wrote my first cookbook , i actually felt that i knew very little about cooking - i just started cooking at the age of 20 myself .
so what i said to my editor was that i was going to do a book on the food that i know , that i cook myself .
and what i know is the food of delhi .
that 's what my first book is - it 's pretty much all the recipes from my relatives , from my friends , in my city , the recipes i grew up with and that my mother sent to me in little air letters when i was a student at rada .
i very much doubt that i would have had a full-blown cooking career in india , because the way i was raised , we had cooks in our house , and the cooks cooked .
my mother would go in occasionally to supervise the food , but that was it .
i probably would have grown up not cooking on a regular basis - though of course it 's hard to know , but i tend to doubt it .
i do n't think i would go back and live in india now because i have kids and grandchildren who were raised in america .
i knew as a very young girl in india that i was destined to travel , destined to try and fulfil a lot of my ambitions .
i was n't quite clear what those ambitions were , but i knew they were going to take to a place where i would be with an international group as opposed to a national group .
one 's roots are terribly important - the word roots is roots , and that 's where the tree grows from .
but i think some people are destined to be national trees , and stay in the land of their birth , but i think somehow i was destined to be an international tree , and to pass on whatever my roots were feeding me onto all kinds of other people .
i just feel that i did n't choose any of this , but somehow it 's come about , and i have very few regrets about it .

madhur jaffrey is an actress , tv presenter and writer - but it is for her cookery that she is best known .
she was born in delhi , india .
she left the country at the age of 20 to come to britain .
i have an interesting reason for leaving .
i got an indian scholarship to begin with , for the theatre really , and my case to the indian government was that there were no schools that taught acting for the stage in india at that time - we 're talking mid-50s - and could i please use that scholarship abroad ?
i think somehow i was destined to be an international tree , and to pass on whatever my roots were feeding me to all kinds of other people i had a scholarship for two years , and then my dream was always to be another marlon brando .
i wanted to act , and i wanted to act in a certain style - which of course was to me in america .
here i was , a trained actress , and i had just won a huge award at the berlin international film festival as best actress .
i thought : " now my career is made . "
but no such thing happened , so i was here in the united states looking desperately for work and not getting work .
i had three little girls at that time , and i had to send them to school .
i said : " how am i going to do it ? "
and the only thing i know how to do , perhaps , is write .
so i started writing for magazines and newspapers , and i was writing about anything i knew anything about .
i also ventured to write about food - and somehow , food writing just took off .
when i wrote my first cookbook , i actually felt that i knew very little about cooking - i just started cooking at the age of 20 myself .

scientists at the university hospital of wales found there was no evidence of any prevention of violence when town centres were monitored .
however , the presence of security cameras did help reduce the severity of injuries inflicted in street fights .
they also alerted the police to trouble more quickly and reduced the number of people needing emergency hospital treatment , the research published on monday in the journal injury prevention showed .
the report stated : " the benefit of cctv might lie less in preventing such offences ... but more in facilitating a faster police response to arguments or assaults in public spaces , which limits their duration and therefore reduces the incidence and seriousness of injury . "
the research has highlighted inadequacy and " inappropriateness " of official police statistics on violent crime which showed only a quarter of assaults leading to treatment in casualty departments . "

professor jonathan shepherd the report claims to be the first to compare police and hospital data , and authors said its four-year time span was longer than other cctv studies .
the research studied reports from police between 1995 and 1999 covering street violence in five towns with cameras put in place , and five towns without cctv , and checked it against casualty records for assaults treated .
detection rates by the police of street assaults remained the same - the authors said they would have fallen in the towns with cctv cameras if they were acting as a deterrent .
co-author professor jonathan shepherd , professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery , said : " the benefits of cctv probably include enabling the police to get to a punch-up or brawl earlier than they would otherwise .

in the third part of the series , bridget kendall visits vorkuta in the desolate far north .
gavriil has lived all his life in the tundra it felt like stepping into a christmas card .
there on the edge of one of vorkuta 's outlying settlements , just visible against the unlit black tundra stretching behind them , were a dozen reindeer harnessed to three laden sledges .
it was gently snowing .
a white film dusted their shaggy coats and nestled in the branches of their antlers .
some of the reindeer rested their noses on each other 's backs , as though to share the weight of their heavy headgear .
others settled down in the snow , patiently waiting .
the nenets herdsman with them , gavriil , was smoking a cigarette .
he was dressed in embroidered furs and hand-sewn boots of reindeer skin , thigh-high and double thickness .
he had come 40 kilometres - four hours ' ride across the snowy plains - to pick up the family 's monthly child welfare cheque and spend it on provisions .
the nenets people are the original inhabitants of the area his wife and niece were holding plastic bags of oranges and apples .
in the furs on the sledge lay two large bottles of fizzy orange fanta .
gavriil spoke a bit of russian with a thick accent .
it sounded almost like japanese , all staccato intonation and no distinction between " l " and " r " sounds .
he told us he 'd lived all his life in the tundra , herding reindeer and hunting .
his home was a " chuma " , a reindeer-hide tent .
he shared it with his wife , baby daughter and his brother 's family .
he also had two small girls among 70 nenets children who were spending the winter in a local boarding school .
it was set up by russian villagers to ensure the kids got regular health checks and food through the long harsh winter - and to give them basic reading and writing skills in russian .
there 's nothing like that in the tundra .
these nenets children can now help fill out forms or act as translators if their illiterate parents ever need russian hospital treatment .
we visited the school a little later .
they were shy children .
they stared at us with solemn eyes as they sorted through jigsaw puzzles and played chess .
nenets children spend the winter in a local boarding school but best of all , their russian teachers said , they liked the toys they made themselves : peg dolls fashioned out of wild ducks ' beaks , toy sledges whittled from wood , and droves of reindeer , modelled lovingly out of plasticine .
their favourite book was a photo album of the endless flat landscape where they roamed with their nomadic families in the summer .
" what station is your radio programme on ? " asked gavriil unexpectedly .
it transpired he had a radio out in the tundra .
" i 'll try and find it , " he said optimistically , as he turned to rouse his herd and head back into the snowy darkness .
the nomadic nenets were the original inhabitants of this icy wasteland , long before the first russian encampment .
our encounter left me wondering how soon they 'd find themselves alone again .
sacrifice way up in the arctic circle , perched on the 67th parallel in the far north of russia , vorkuta has always been a quintessentially soviet creation .
many died in the gulags millions passed through its prison camp system in the stalin years , first digging through the ice to lay its railway line , then working under armed guards to extract the rich seams of coal from its basin of mines .
on the single ring road that loops round the town but goes nowhere , there is one small cemetery of crosses to remind you of that early sacrifice .
many of the names are polish and german .
a mournful baltic queen stands guard in her stone canopy , erected by lithuanian gulag survivors .
but the countless russian prisoners who passed through here have been eclipsed by more recent history .
today , most inhabitants will tell you they or their parents first arrived in vorkuta in the 1950s and 60s .
they were drawn by high wages and brave soviet claims that this proletarian enterprise coupled with communist enthusiasm would push back the frontiers of civilisation .
but that ill-founded optimism has run its course .
in the past 10 years , half vorkuta 's coal mines have closed .
and though the remaining mines are under new private management that has promised investment , all the talk is of leaving .
they say if you can get away by the time you 're 30 or 35 , you can save yourself nail , miner after all , who would want to make their home in this desolate barren spot if they no longer had to ?
why chance your health and safety by descending daily into darkness , to choke on coal dust and trudge for miles through badly maintained tunnels ?
why submit yourself and your family to 10 months of snow , no daylight at all in midwinter and temperatures that regularly drop to -40c ?
" it 's only really bad when it drops to below -60 .
then the petrol freezes in your tank , " said one miner , full of bravura .
others were more circumspect .

in the third part of the series , bridget kendall visits vorkuta in the desolate far north .
gavriil has lived all his life in the tundra it felt like stepping into a christmas card .
there on the edge of one of vorkuta 's outlying settlements , just visible against the unlit black tundra stretching behind them , were a dozen reindeer harnessed to three laden sledges .
it was gently snowing .
a white film dusted their shaggy coats and nestled in the branches of their antlers .
some of the reindeer rested their noses on each other 's backs , as though to share the weight of their heavy headgear .
others settled down in the snow , patiently waiting .
the nenets herdsman with them , gavriil , was smoking a cigarette .
he was dressed in embroidered furs and hand-sewn boots of reindeer skin , thigh-high and double thickness .
he had come 40 kilometres - four hours ' ride across the snowy plains - to pick up the family 's monthly child welfare cheque and spend it on provisions .
the nenets people are the original inhabitants of the area his wife and niece were holding plastic bags of oranges and apples .
in the furs on the sledge lay two large bottles of fizzy orange fanta .
gavriil spoke a bit of russian with a thick accent .
it sounded almost like japanese , all staccato intonation and no distinction between " l " and " r " sounds .
he told us he 'd lived all his life in the tundra , herding reindeer and hunting .
his home was a " chuma " , a reindeer-hide tent .
he shared it with his wife , baby daughter and his brother 's family .
he also had two small girls among 70 nenets children who were spending the winter in a local boarding school .
it was set up by russian villagers to ensure the kids got regular health checks and food through the long harsh winter - and to give them basic reading and writing skills in russian .
there 's nothing like that in the tundra .
these nenets children can now help fill out forms or act as translators if their illiterate parents ever need russian hospital treatment .
we visited the school a little later .
they were shy children .
they stared at us with solemn eyes as they sorted through jigsaw puzzles and played chess .
nenets children spend the winter in a local boarding school but best of all , their russian teachers said , they liked the toys they made themselves : peg dolls fashioned out of wild ducks ' beaks , toy sledges whittled from wood , and droves of reindeer , modelled lovingly out of plasticine .
their favourite book was a photo album of the endless flat landscape where they roamed with their nomadic families in the summer .
" what station is your radio programme on ? " asked gavriil unexpectedly .
it transpired he had a radio out in the tundra .
" i 'll try and find it , " he said optimistically , as he turned to rouse his herd and head back into the snowy darkness .
the nomadic nenets were the original inhabitants of this icy wasteland , long before the first russian encampment .
our encounter left me wondering how soon they 'd find themselves alone again .
sacrifice way up in the arctic circle , perched on the 67th parallel in the far north of russia , vorkuta has always been a quintessentially soviet creation .
many died in the gulags millions passed through its prison camp system in the stalin years , first digging through the ice to lay its railway line , then working under armed guards to extract the rich seams of coal from its basin of mines .
on the single ring road that loops round the town but goes nowhere , there is one small cemetery of crosses to remind you of that early sacrifice .
many of the names are polish and german .
a mournful baltic queen stands guard in her stone canopy , erected by lithuanian gulag survivors .
but the countless russian prisoners who passed through here have been eclipsed by more recent history .
today , most inhabitants will tell you they or their parents first arrived in vorkuta in the 1950s and 60s .
they were drawn by high wages and brave soviet claims that this proletarian enterprise coupled with communist enthusiasm would push back the frontiers of civilisation .
but that ill-founded optimism has run its course .
in the past 10 years , half vorkuta 's coal mines have closed .
and though the remaining mines are under new private management that has promised investment , all the talk is of leaving .
they say if you can get away by the time you 're 30 or 35 , you can save yourself nail , miner after all , who would want to make their home in this desolate barren spot if they no longer had to ?
why chance your health and safety by descending daily into darkness , to choke on coal dust and trudge for miles through badly maintained tunnels ?
why submit yourself and your family to 10 months of snow , no daylight at all in midwinter and temperatures that regularly drop to -40c ?
" it 's only really bad when it drops to below -60 .
then the petrol freezes in your tank , " said one miner , full of bravura .
others were more circumspect .

in the third part of the series , bridget kendall visits vorkuta in the desolate far north .
gavriil has lived all his life in the tundra it felt like stepping into a christmas card .
there on the edge of one of vorkuta 's outlying settlements , just visible against the unlit black tundra stretching behind them , were a dozen reindeer harnessed to three laden sledges .
it was gently snowing .
a white film dusted their shaggy coats and nestled in the branches of their antlers .
some of the reindeer rested their noses on each other 's backs , as though to share the weight of their heavy headgear .
others settled down in the snow , patiently waiting .
the nenets herdsman with them , gavriil , was smoking a cigarette .
he was dressed in embroidered furs and hand-sewn boots of reindeer skin , thigh-high and double thickness .
he had come 40 kilometres - four hours ' ride across the snowy plains - to pick up the family 's monthly child welfare cheque and spend it on provisions .
the nenets people are the original inhabitants of the area his wife and niece were holding plastic bags of oranges and apples .
in the furs on the sledge lay two large bottles of fizzy orange fanta .
gavriil spoke a bit of russian with a thick accent .
it sounded almost like japanese , all staccato intonation and no distinction between " l " and " r " sounds .
he told us he 'd lived all his life in the tundra , herding reindeer and hunting .
his home was a " chuma " , a reindeer-hide tent .
he shared it with his wife , baby daughter and his brother 's family .
he also had two small girls among 70 nenets children who were spending the winter in a local boarding school .
it was set up by russian villagers to ensure the kids got regular health checks and food through the long harsh winter - and to give them basic reading and writing skills in russian .
there 's nothing like that in the tundra .
these nenets children can now help fill out forms or act as translators if their illiterate parents ever need russian hospital treatment .
we visited the school a little later .
they were shy children .
they stared at us with solemn eyes as they sorted through jigsaw puzzles and played chess .
nenets children spend the winter in a local boarding school but best of all , their russian teachers said , they liked the toys they made themselves : peg dolls fashioned out of wild ducks ' beaks , toy sledges whittled from wood , and droves of reindeer , modelled lovingly out of plasticine .
their favourite book was a photo album of the endless flat landscape where they roamed with their nomadic families in the summer .
" what station is your radio programme on ? " asked gavriil unexpectedly .
it transpired he had a radio out in the tundra .
" i 'll try and find it , " he said optimistically , as he turned to rouse his herd and head back into the snowy darkness .
the nomadic nenets were the original inhabitants of this icy wasteland , long before the first russian encampment .
our encounter left me wondering how soon they 'd find themselves alone again .
sacrifice way up in the arctic circle , perched on the 67th parallel in the far north of russia , vorkuta has always been a quintessentially soviet creation .
many died in the gulags millions passed through its prison camp system in the stalin years , first digging through the ice to lay its railway line , then working under armed guards to extract the rich seams of coal from its basin of mines .
on the single ring road that loops round the town but goes nowhere , there is one small cemetery of crosses to remind you of that early sacrifice .
many of the names are polish and german .
a mournful baltic queen stands guard in her stone canopy , erected by lithuanian gulag survivors .
but the countless russian prisoners who passed through here have been eclipsed by more recent history .
today , most inhabitants will tell you they or their parents first arrived in vorkuta in the 1950s and 60s .
they were drawn by high wages and brave soviet claims that this proletarian enterprise coupled with communist enthusiasm would push back the frontiers of civilisation .
but that ill-founded optimism has run its course .
in the past 10 years , half vorkuta 's coal mines have closed .
and though the remaining mines are under new private management that has promised investment , all the talk is of leaving .
they say if you can get away by the time you 're 30 or 35 , you can save yourself nail , miner after all , who would want to make their home in this desolate barren spot if they no longer had to ?
why chance your health and safety by descending daily into darkness , to choke on coal dust and trudge for miles through badly maintained tunnels ?
why submit yourself and your family to 10 months of snow , no daylight at all in midwinter and temperatures that regularly drop to -40c ?
" it 's only really bad when it drops to below -60 .
then the petrol freezes in your tank , " said one miner , full of bravura .
others were more circumspect .
" they say if you can get away by the time you 're 30 or 35 , you can save yourself , " said nail , a soft-spoken miner with an intense gaze who invited us home to meet his family .
otherwise , he told us , your body adapts to the thinner oxygen .
very little grows in the freezing conditions there are plenty of scare stories of those who hung on until retirement , only to move to a warmer climate in southern russia and fall dead of a heart attack in a year or two .
" nothing grows in this place , " added his wife lyuda .
" it 's solid ice if you dig two feet down , permafrost all year round .
our boys only see flowers and trees on television .
i want them to grow up in a place where they can run around outside , like normal children . "
in fact there are trees in vorkuta , a few stunted bushes in the park in the town centre .
but they are rare survivors of a dispiriting planting project .
every autumn an expedition of volunteers takes the train south to where the russian forest starts and selects saplings to bring back for replanting .
but every year two out of three young trees are killed by the savage frosts .
so every autumn they set out again to dig up new saplings .
unreality such harsh conditions breed character .
warmth and good humour abound here .
and many in vorkuta say they are determined to keep their town alive and flourishing .
" you should be here on new year 's eve , when the whole town gathers to view the ice sculptures lit up in the main square .
you should see the bewitching colours of the northern lights when they flicker across the skies .
come back in the summer and we 'll take you fishing , " they told us .
the town can not afford street lighting or snow clearing we caught the end of vorkuta 's annual polar games , an extravagant sporting jamboree , a sort of mini-olympics of the russian arctic .
it had all the soviet pomp and ceremony of prizes and fanfares which elsewhere in russia has gone out of fashion .
but there was another typically soviet quality to these home-grown celebrations : their absurd unreality .
a frank conversation with the deputy mayor revealed that vorkuta is so broke that the mayor 's office can not even pay for street lighting or snow clearing , let alone foot the bill for a sports festival .
the town is bankrupt .
no wonder moscow wants a radical rationalisation .
already several outlying communities are in the process of being abandoned .
on some stretches of the ring road , you pass settlements where roofs have fallen in , doors and windows are missing , buildings have collapsed into snowdrifts .
and here and there , like a ghostly monument to an era that is passing , an uninhabited tower block has frozen solid and turned into a white block of ice .
many saw the writing on the wall a few years ago , packed up their belongings and got out of here .
now the russian government wants to persuade thousands more to sell up and resettle elsewhere .
those who remain will hunker down in the city centre to save on lighting , heat and transport costs .
who knows for how much longer vorkuta 's six swimming pools , two theatres and the only covered ice rink in the russian arctic circle will receive funding ?
who knows for how much longer this improbable town will continue to glow like a las vegas in an arctic desert ?

there 's nothing like that in the tundra .
these nenets children can now help fill out forms or act as translators if their illiterate parents ever need russian hospital treatment .
we visited the school a little later .
they were shy children .
they stared at us with solemn eyes as they sorted through jigsaw puzzles and played chess .
nenets children spend the winter in a local boarding school but best of all , their russian teachers said , they liked the toys they made themselves : peg dolls fashioned out of wild ducks ' beaks , toy sledges whittled from wood , and droves of reindeer , modelled lovingly out of plasticine .
their favourite book was a photo album of the endless flat landscape where they roamed with their nomadic families in the summer .
" what station is your radio programme on ? " asked gavriil unexpectedly .
it transpired he had a radio out in the tundra .
" i 'll try and find it , " he said optimistically , as he turned to rouse his herd and head back into the snowy darkness .
the nomadic nenets were the original inhabitants of this icy wasteland , long before the first russian encampment .
our encounter left me wondering how soon they 'd find themselves alone again .
sacrifice way up in the arctic circle , perched on the 67th parallel in the far north of russia , vorkuta has always been a quintessentially soviet creation .
many died in the gulags millions passed through its prison camp system in the stalin years , first digging through the ice to lay its railway line , then working under armed guards to extract the rich seams of coal from its basin of mines .
on the single ring road that loops round the town but goes nowhere , there is one small cemetery of crosses to remind you of that early sacrifice .
many of the names are polish and german .
a mournful baltic queen stands guard in her stone canopy , erected by lithuanian gulag survivors .
but the countless russian prisoners who passed through here have been eclipsed by more recent history .
today , most inhabitants will tell you they or their parents first arrived in vorkuta in the 1950s and 60s .
they were drawn by high wages and brave soviet claims that this proletarian enterprise coupled with communist enthusiasm would push back the frontiers of civilisation .
but that ill-founded optimism has run its course .
in the past 10 years , half vorkuta 's coal mines have closed .
and though the remaining mines are under new private management that has promised investment , all the talk is of leaving .
they say if you can get away by the time you 're 30 or 35 , you can save yourself nail , miner after all , who would want to make their home in this desolate barren spot if they no longer had to ?
why chance your health and safety by descending daily into darkness , to choke on coal dust and trudge for miles through badly maintained tunnels ?
why submit yourself and your family to 10 months of snow , no daylight at all in midwinter and temperatures that regularly drop to -40c ?
" it 's only really bad when it drops to below -60 .
then the petrol freezes in your tank , " said one miner , full of bravura .
others were more circumspect .
" they say if you can get away by the time you 're 30 or 35 , you can save yourself , " said nail , a soft-spoken miner with an intense gaze who invited us home to meet his family .
otherwise , he told us , your body adapts to the thinner oxygen .
very little grows in the freezing conditions there are plenty of scare stories of those who hung on until retirement , only to move to a warmer climate in southern russia and fall dead of a heart attack in a year or two .
" nothing grows in this place , " added his wife lyuda .
" it 's solid ice if you dig two feet down , permafrost all year round .
our boys only see flowers and trees on television .
i want them to grow up in a place where they can run around outside , like normal children . "
in fact there are trees in vorkuta , a few stunted bushes in the park in the town centre .
but they are rare survivors of a dispiriting planting project .
every autumn an expedition of volunteers takes the train south to where the russian forest starts and selects saplings to bring back for replanting .
but every year two out of three young trees are killed by the savage frosts .
so every autumn they set out again to dig up new saplings .
unreality such harsh conditions breed character .
warmth and good humour abound here .
and many in vorkuta say they are determined to keep their town alive and flourishing .
" you should be here on new year 's eve , when the whole town gathers to view the ice sculptures lit up in the main square .
you should see the bewitching colours of the northern lights when they flicker across the skies .
come back in the summer and we 'll take you fishing , " they told us .
the town can not afford street lighting or snow clearing we caught the end of vorkuta 's annual polar games , an extravagant sporting jamboree , a sort of mini-olympics of the russian arctic .
it had all the soviet pomp and ceremony of prizes and fanfares which elsewhere in russia has gone out of fashion .
but there was another typically soviet quality to these home-grown celebrations : their absurd unreality .
a frank conversation with the deputy mayor revealed that vorkuta is so broke that the mayor 's office can not even pay for street lighting or snow clearing , let alone foot the bill for a sports festival .
the town is bankrupt .
no wonder moscow wants a radical rationalisation .
already several outlying communities are in the process of being abandoned .
on some stretches of the ring road , you pass settlements where roofs have fallen in , doors and windows are missing , buildings have collapsed into snowdrifts .
and here and there , like a ghostly monument to an era that is passing , an uninhabited tower block has frozen solid and turned into a white block of ice .
many saw the writing on the wall a few years ago , packed up their belongings and got out of here .
now the russian government wants to persuade thousands more to sell up and resettle elsewhere .
those who remain will hunker down in the city centre to save on lighting , heat and transport costs .
who knows for how much longer vorkuta 's six swimming pools , two theatres and the only covered ice rink in the russian arctic circle will receive funding ?
who knows for how much longer this improbable town will continue to glow like a las vegas in an arctic desert ?

in the third part of the series , bridget kendall visits vorkuta in the desolate far north .
gavriil has lived all his life in the tundra it felt like stepping into a christmas card .
there on the edge of one of vorkuta 's outlying settlements , just visible against the unlit black tundra stretching behind them , were a dozen reindeer harnessed to three laden sledges .
it was gently snowing .
a white film dusted their shaggy coats and nestled in the branches of their antlers .
some of the reindeer rested their noses on each other 's backs , as though to share the weight of their heavy headgear .
others settled down in the snow , patiently waiting .
the nenets herdsman with them , gavriil , was smoking a cigarette .
he was dressed in embroidered furs and hand-sewn boots of reindeer skin , thigh-high and double thickness .
he had come 40 kilometres - four hours ' ride across the snowy plains - to pick up the family 's monthly child welfare cheque and spend it on provisions .
the nenets people are the original inhabitants of the area his wife and niece were holding plastic bags of oranges and apples .
in the furs on the sledge lay two large bottles of fizzy orange fanta .
gavriil spoke a bit of russian with a thick accent .
it sounded almost like japanese , all staccato intonation and no distinction between " l " and " r " sounds .
he told us he 'd lived all his life in the tundra , herding reindeer and hunting .
his home was a " chuma " , a reindeer-hide tent .
he shared it with his wife , baby daughter and his brother 's family .
he also had two small girls among 70 nenets children who were spending the winter in a local boarding school .

the public and commercial services union is demanding better pay rises for more than 100,000 civil servants .
voting was already planned among 86,000 pcs members at the department for work and pensions over a 2.6 % pay rise .
but co-ordinated ballots will now also be held at the home office , department for constitutional affairs , treasury solicitors and the prison service .
the civil service could therefore be hit by the biggest industrial unrest in 10 years with more than 100,000 workers in different sections launching co-ordinated walkouts .
the ballot for industrial action will take place between 5 and 19 january , with the possibility of strikes at the end of the month bringing chaos to job centres , benefit offices , prisons , courts and the immigration service . "
we shall be preparing for the eventuality of industrial action " pcs general secretary mark serwotka about 8,500 civil servants at the home office are to decide on a pay offer said by the union to be worth 1.3 % , although ministers insist it would increase salaries by 5.7 % .
another 7,000 at the department for constitutional affairs will vote over the next few weeks on a pay offer said by the union to be worth up to 2.8 % , while 4,500 workers in the prison service will vote on their pay offer , which union leaders say is worth 1 % .
also voting are 150 workers in the treasury solicitors .
the pcs said it had been left with no option by the " increasingly hard line " taken by government departments over pay rises , which it said were being imposed before staff had voted on whether to accept them .
general secretary mark serwotka said : " we will be leaving no stone unturned to try to reach a settlement , but in the meantime we shall be preparing for the eventuality of industrial action .
" this is not a step we have taken lightly and we still hope there is an opportunity to sort out the deepening pay crisis . "
mr serwotka is calling for a return to a national system of pay bargaining for the civil service .
one out of every four civil servants earned less than £ 13,750 a year , he said .
imposing unsatisfactory pay deals had left members " incensed and angry " , mr serwotka added .

gary jules is a name that has only started to become familiar in the past few weeks .
the los angeles musician lent his voice to the sparse , haunting cover of mad world for the cult movie donnie darko - and the song is now number one .
" i honestly thought , it 's a really great song and people love it but because it 's christmas people are going to go for a christmas song , " he said .
" at about two o 'clock in the morning the phone rang and i heard and i was just freaking out , " the singer said .
" my wife was awake but after about two hours she went back to sleep and i was just pacing around the house , staring at the ceiling hoping she would wake up again . "
the song had been an outside chance to win the christmas number one when the festive contenders were announced .
' life is mad ' jules said after the win he thought the song was easy to relate to .
" i think it 's a really beautiful example of a person struggling with the fact that life is mad , " he said .
" i honestly think it 's one of the most beautiful songs i have ever heard and the way it 's stripped down now just pins people . "
he said of the attention : " it 's fantastic , it feels completely surreal . "
he said the uk chart win was unlikely to change his life in the us too much because he was a virtual unknown at home .
" i 've been working the life of a regular musician in the us , and this has taken off in the uk which is phenomenal , " he added .
the 34-year-old has released two albums in his career and gained a loyal fanbase in los angeles - but less in the way of mainstream commercial recognition .
the mad world track came about through working with old friend michael andrews , who penned the score to donnie darko , a surreal tale of a teenage boy whose meetings with a grotesque giant rabbit change the course of his life .
tears for fears originally scored a hit with mad world in 1982 the song took 90 minutes to record in 2001 , and has become big news thanks to british radio championing the track .
" every so often a song with just vocals , piano and cello creeps up on you and says something about who you are , where you 're going which stops you in your tracks , " explains the artist .
mad world 's success is an opportunity the californian singer-songwriter is keen to grasp .
jules ' imaginatively-entitled album trading snakeoil for wolftickets is coming out in the new year , and will offer an introduction to his work .
" i consider myself to be from the folk songwriting tradition , post-punk rock folk , " explains jules .
" an album 's worth of mad worlds would be pushing it a bit .
it was produced by michael andrews and i in a basement and is very organic . "

parmalat milk is the italian milk ; santal is the italian fruit juice ; a dozen other products , from pomi pulped tomatoes to grisbi biscuits , are staples of every italian store-cupboard .
if you 're in the curious position of not eating or drinking , parmalat owns parma football club , a stalwart of the serie a. outside italy , the firm is spreading its tentacles .
from almost nothing a decade ago , it is now in 30 countries - most aggressively in eastern europe and latin america .
structural sprawl all most impressive .
from a single delicatessen in the early 1960s , the tanzi family have built up a company with annual revenues of 7.6bn euros , and 36,400 staff at 139 production sites .
but as this week has shown , there is a less wholesome side to parmalat .
no-one denies that the company operates one of the most formidable consumer-goods operations on the planet , but the finances underpinning it raise troubling questions .
over the past decade of headlong international expansion , parmalat has developed a global structure of bewildering complexity , at least in part to minimise its tax liability .
the company is listed on half-a-dozen stock exchanges , and produces detailed financial statements , but analysts suspect that the headline balance-sheet figures - currently some 6bn euros in debt and 4bn euros in assets - simply do not reflect reality .
on 19 december , bank of america took the unusual step of rejecting as false a parmalat document , which purported to show that the firm had 4bn euros stowed in the cayman islands .
funny money even if parmalat is able to produce its cayman hoard , this sort of thing is seen as a pretty funny way for a modern multinational to behave .
parmalat , its thrusting image notwithstanding , behaves worryingly like the tight-lipped family-controlled business it remains .
analysts wonder , for example , why the company has not used its supposed cash pile to pay down its debts , instead issuing new bonds to replace the old .
they also want more details on epicurum , a peculiar fund - based , again , in the caymans - with which parmalat has done substantial business , including an unexplained 500m-euro cash injection .
pricewaterhousecoopers is now investigating epicurum , as well as bonlat , the company that produced the phoney documents for bank of america .
europe 's next enron all this may , of course , be wholly innocent .
but european markets are spooked because it smells horribly like enron , the us company whose global web of complex financial transactions brought down a fast-growing business .
over the past couple of years , french media conglomerate vivendi , dutch supermarket ahold and italian car maker fiat have all shown enron-like qualities .
but parmalat 's particular fondness for large derivatives transactions - huge off-balance-sheet deals in complex financial instruments - makes it the closest apparent counterpart this side of the atlantic .
staying alive ?
it is less likely , however , that parmalat will disintegrate as completely as did enron .
the company is tightly woven into both italy 's society and its financial system : many powerful forces have an interest in seeing it survive .
prime minister silvio berlusconi has already adjusted the laws on administration to give parmalat a better chance of restructuring .
its underlying business is certainly sound , which could not always be said of much of enron 's inflated empire of gas traders and electricity brokers .
and the company seems to be taking surprisingly rapid steps to clear up its mess .
the founding family was brusquely shunted from the management suite this week , and turnaround specialist enrico bondi has been installed in the top job .
parmalat certainly needs every drop of mr bondi 's unrivalled credibility .

the worst of the weather passed down the east coast on sunday night and early monday morning .
several major roads in north yorkshire were either blocked by drifting snow and abandoned vehicles or described by police as treacherous .
the a171 between whitby and scarborough was closed as cars and lorries blocked the carriageway and the a169 at blue bank south of whitby was impassable .
police warning the hazardous conditions were blamed by police for an accident on the a170 at sutton bank , which officers said was passable only for four-wheel drive vehicles .
the resort of scarborough had also experienced a " spectacular " hailstorm overnight , a north yorkshire police spokesman said .
" road conditions are very poor in many areas , especially the north york moors , " he added .
" drivers should not set out on journeys unless they are essential . "
in east yorkshire , the worst-affected area was between bridlington and driffield , with lorries blocking the b1253 at boynton and cars abandoned at nafferton off the a614 .
forecasters have said the pre-christmas cold snap will subside by tuesday and there will be milder temperatures on christmas day .
extra equipment a spokesman for aa roadwatch said : " when people wake up to snow they should allow extra time for their journeys , especially on minor routes . "
a spokesman for the highways agency said : " drivers are advised to check for up-to-date information on weather before they set off , and during their journey . "
among the advice for drivers is to take care around gritters and snowploughs and remember that it can take 10 times longer to stop in icy conditions .
other advice is to manoeuvre gently and avoid harsh braking and acceleration .
when driving in snow , drivers are advised to make sure they are equipped with warm clothes , food , water , boots , a torch and spade .

sugar producers in rich countries and their former colonies will have to fight hard in 2004 to continue receiving special treatment from the authorities .

in the letter , the senators warned that congress could oppose the free trade agreement with five central american countries if it was to include " provisions harmful to the sugar industry " .

the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- is for the first time keen to expose its sugar producers to the harsh forces of the free market .
while in the us , sugar states feel threatened by a proposed free trade agreement with five central american states .
the removal of agricultural subsidies and other protective measures in europe and the us is seen as crucial to move global trade talks forward in 2004 .
the sugar industry is also targeted due to the impact sugary food and drinks have on health .
overproduction europe supports free trade , but there are some areas where it has what can only be described as something of a blind spot .
the way it treats its sugar industry is perhaps the most glaring example of protectionism .
sugar producers in europe and its former colonies live in a bubble protected from fluctuations in world prices .
sweetened by subsidies , sugar beet farmers produce some of the most expensive sugar in the world , and they produce lots of it .
the world price for white sugar is about 250 euros -lrb- £ 175 -rrb- a tonne .

the queen began it last january with a rare health problem .
she wrenched her right knee shortly before last christmas and was clearly in some pain when she attended morning service at sandringham on christmas day .
in january she was admitted to the kind edward vii hospital in london for surgery to the knee to remove a small piece of torn cartilage .
the delicate keyhole surgery required the queen to have a general anaesthetic .
after two nights in hospital she left for a period of recuperation which took longer than expected .
eleven months later she was to return to the hospital for an identical operation on her left knee and surgery to her face to remove what buckingham palace described as " benign skin lesions " .
these growths had appeared in recent months : one on her left eyebrow , another , much smaller growth below her left eye and a third on the left side of her nose .
as the queen emerged from hospital on 13 december the evidence of the surgery was clearly visible on her face , with two stitches in the incision on her left eyebrow .
burrell trial legacy she seemed cheerful , however - looking forward to a period of recuperation over christmas , and reflection on a year when , once again , the royal family had been caught up in the continuing backwash from the trial , last year , of paul burrell , the former butler to diana , princess of wales .
how the royals must regret that that prosecution ever went ahead .
indeed , senior royal officials express themselves with uncharacteristic bitterness about what they regard as the foolishness and incompetence of the metropolitan police over the way the burrell inquiry was handled .
once again it has been the prince of wales who has been the principal loser from it all .
first , in march , his private secretary sir michael peat produced his report into the allegations which had emerged in the aftermath of the trial .
sir michael concluded that there had been " deficiencies " in the way the prince 's household had dealt with the handling of official gifts .
of 180 such gifts to the prince in the previous three years , 19 could not be accounted for .
the report also found that members of the prince 's household had accepted a " range of gifts and entertainment " from royal warrant holders and other suppliers .
in one case , the aggregate value had amounted to several thousand pounds .
fresh allegations much of sir michael 's inquiry in this regard had focused on the prince 's former valet and special assistant , michael fawcett , a man who was said to be " indispensable " to the prince .
whilst sir michael 's inquiry failed to produce " any evidence of financial impropriety on his -lrb- mr fawcett 's -rrb- part " the report stated that he had infringed internal rules relating to gifts .
michael fawcett resigned from the household , though he was immediately awarded a contract to advise the prince as a freelance consultant on entertainment and other matters .
it was of course the same michael fawcett who figured in another , even more bizarre legacy of the burrell trial .
in october , whilst the prince of wales was on an official visit to india , his household -lrb- which had , by then , moved from st james ' palace to the prince 's new london home at clarence house -rrb- was informed by the mail on sunday newspaper that it was intending to publish a long interview with a former royal footman by the name of george smith .
mr smith had alleged that he had been raped by a male member of the household .
this allegation was first made in 1996 .
the princess of wales had tape recorded a conversation with mr smith in which he named his alleged attacker and also made an even more astonishing allegation : that he had witnessed a male member of the household in a " compromising position " with a senior member of the royal family .
media battle the tape of this conversation has not been seen since the days immediately after the princess 's death in 1997 .
the police believed that paul burrell might have kept it , and it was in pursuit of it , and other highly sensitive items , that they raided his home in cheshire , where they found - not the tape - but the many other items which formed the basis for their failed prosecution of him for theft .
george smith 's allegations had been swirling around royal circles for years .
he is - even in the view of his supporters - an unreliable witness with a history of emotional difficulties .
the mail on sunday never published its full interview with george smith because michael fawcett obtained a high court injunction preventing it .
a few days later , sir michael peat made a televised statement in which he identified the prince of wales as the hitherto anonymous " senior royal " who was the subject of this " risible " allegation .
he made the statement on the basis that the prince had absolutely nothing to hide .
very few reasonable people , i suspect , will have given the -lrb- still unspoken -rrb- allegation any credence , but the cumulative effect of all of this is certainly not helpful to prince charles ' image or indeed , in a broader context , to the image of the royal family firm .
fifty years after her coronation , the queen will indeed put her bruised knee up this christmas and look back on a year which they 'd hoped might be dull , but which most certainly was n't .

burrell trial legacy she seemed cheerful , however - looking forward to a period of recuperation over christmas , and reflection on a year when , once again , the royal family had been caught up in the continuing backwash from the trial , last year , of paul burrell , the former butler to diana , princess of wales .
how the royals must regret that that prosecution ever went ahead .
indeed , senior royal officials express themselves with uncharacteristic bitterness about what they regard as the foolishness and incompetence of the metropolitan police over the way the burrell inquiry was handled .
former royal butler paul burrell sparked a bout of negative publicity once again it has been the prince of wales who has been the principal loser from it all .
first , in march , his private secretary sir michael peat produced his report into the allegations which had emerged in the aftermath of the trial .
sir michael concluded that there had been " deficiencies " in the way the prince 's household had dealt with the handling of official gifts .
of 180 such gifts to the prince in the previous three years , 19 could not be accounted for .
the report also found that members of the prince 's household had accepted a " range of gifts and entertainment " from royal warrant holders and other suppliers .
in one case , the aggregate value had amounted to several thousand pounds .
fresh allegations much of sir michael 's inquiry in this regard had focused on the prince 's former valet and special assistant , michael fawcett , a man who was said to be " indispensable " to the prince .
whilst sir michael 's inquiry failed to produce " any evidence of financial impropriety on his -lrb- mr fawcett 's -rrb- part " the report stated that he had infringed internal rules relating to gifts .
michael fawcett resigned from the household , though he was immediately awarded a contract to advise the prince as a freelance consultant on entertainment and other matters .
it was of course the same michael fawcett who figured in another , even more bizarre legacy of the burrell trial .
michael fawcett left the prince 's staff in march in october , whilst the prince of wales was on an official visit to india , his household -lrb- which had , by then , moved from st james ' palace to the prince 's new london home at clarence house -rrb- was informed by the mail on sunday newspaper that it was intending to publish a long interview with a former royal footman by the name of george smith .
mr smith had alleged that he had been raped by a male member of the household .
this allegation was first made in 1996 .
the princess of wales had tape recorded a conversation with mr smith in which he named his alleged attacker and also made an even more astonishing allegation : that he had witnessed a male member of the household in a " compromising position " with a senior member of the royal family .
media battle the tape of this conversation has not been seen since the days immediately after the princess 's death in 1997 .
the police believed that paul burrell might have kept it , and it was in pursuit of it , and other highly sensitive items , that they raided his home in cheshire , where they found - not the tape - but the many other items which formed the basis for their failed prosecution of him for theft .
george smith 's allegations had been swirling around royal circles for years .
he is - even in the view of his supporters - an unreliable witness with a history of emotional difficulties .
rumours have rocked prince charles ' household the mail on sunday never published its full interview with george smith because michael fawcett obtained a high court injunction preventing it .
a few days later , sir michael peat made a televised statement in which he identified the prince of wales as the hitherto anonymous " senior royal " who was the subject of this " risible " allegation .
he made the statement on the basis that the prince had absolutely nothing to hide .
very few reasonable people , i suspect , will have given the -lrb- still unspoken -rrb- allegation any credence , but the cumulative effect of all of this is certainly not helpful to prince charles ' image or indeed , in a broader context , to the image of the royal family firm .
fifty years after her coronation , the queen will indeed put her bruised knee up this christmas and look back on a year which they 'd hoped might be dull , but which most certainly was n't .

the queen began it last january with a rare health problem .
she wrenched her right knee shortly before last christmas and was clearly in some pain when she attended morning service at sandringham on christmas day .
the queen has undergone some minor operations this year in january she was admitted to the kind edward vii hospital in london for surgery to the knee to remove a small piece of torn cartilage .
the delicate keyhole surgery required the queen to have a general anaesthetic .
after two nights in hospital she left for a period of recuperation which took longer than expected .
eleven months later she was to return to the hospital for an identical operation on her left knee and surgery to her face to remove what buckingham palace described as " benign skin lesions " .
these growths had appeared in recent months : one on her left eyebrow , another , much smaller growth below her left eye and a third on the left side of her nose .
as the queen emerged from hospital on 13 december the evidence of the surgery was clearly visible on her face , with two stitches in the incision on her left eyebrow .
burrell trial legacy she seemed cheerful , however - looking forward to a period of recuperation over christmas , and reflection on a year when , once again , the royal family had been caught up in the continuing backwash from the trial , last year , of paul burrell , the former butler to diana , princess of wales .
how the royals must regret that that prosecution ever went ahead .
indeed , senior royal officials express themselves with uncharacteristic bitterness about what they regard as the foolishness and incompetence of the metropolitan police over the way the burrell inquiry was handled .
former royal butler paul burrell sparked a bout of negative publicity once again it has been the prince of wales who has been the principal loser from it all .
first , in march , his private secretary sir michael peat produced his report into the allegations which had emerged in the aftermath of the trial .
sir michael concluded that there had been " deficiencies " in the way the prince 's household had dealt with the handling of official gifts .
of 180 such gifts to the prince in the previous three years , 19 could not be accounted for .
the report also found that members of the prince 's household had accepted a " range of gifts and entertainment " from royal warrant holders and other suppliers .
in one case , the aggregate value had amounted to several thousand pounds .
fresh allegations much of sir michael 's inquiry in this regard had focused on the prince 's former valet and special assistant , michael fawcett , a man who was said to be " indispensable " to the prince .
whilst sir michael 's inquiry failed to produce " any evidence of financial impropriety on his -lrb- mr fawcett 's -rrb- part " the report stated that he had infringed internal rules relating to gifts .
michael fawcett resigned from the household , though he was immediately awarded a contract to advise the prince as a freelance consultant on entertainment and other matters .
it was of course the same michael fawcett who figured in another , even more bizarre legacy of the burrell trial .
michael fawcett left the prince 's staff in march in october , whilst the prince of wales was on an official visit to india , his household -lrb- which had , by then , moved from st james ' palace to the prince 's new london home at clarence house -rrb- was informed by the mail on sunday newspaper that it was intending to publish a long interview with a former royal footman by the name of george smith .
mr smith had alleged that he had been raped by a male member of the household .
this allegation was first made in 1996 .
the princess of wales had tape recorded a conversation with mr smith in which he named his alleged attacker and also made an even more astonishing allegation : that he had witnessed a male member of the household in a " compromising position " with a senior member of the royal family .
media battle the tape of this conversation has not been seen since the days immediately after the princess 's death in 1997 .
the police believed that paul burrell might have kept it , and it was in pursuit of it , and other highly sensitive items , that they raided his home in cheshire , where they found - not the tape - but the many other items which formed the basis for their failed prosecution of him for theft .
george smith 's allegations had been swirling around royal circles for years .
he is - even in the view of his supporters - an unreliable witness with a history of emotional difficulties .
rumours have rocked prince charles ' household the mail on sunday never published its full interview with george smith because michael fawcett obtained a high court injunction preventing it .
a few days later , sir michael peat made a televised statement in which he identified the prince of wales as the hitherto anonymous " senior royal " who was the subject of this " risible " allegation .
he made the statement on the basis that the prince had absolutely nothing to hide .
very few reasonable people , i suspect , will have given the -lrb- still unspoken -rrb- allegation any credence , but the cumulative effect of all of this is certainly not helpful to prince charles ' image or indeed , in a broader context , to the image of the royal family firm .
fifty years after her coronation , the queen will indeed put her bruised knee up this christmas and look back on a year which they 'd hoped might be dull , but which most certainly was n't .

the pioneering brothers conquered the air on december 17 1903 , flying over a remote sandy island on the atlantic coast of north carolina , usa in their revolutionary motorised " flyer " .
a re-enactment of the feat using a replica of the aircraft will be staged at kitty hawk beach in north carolina , where the original flight took place .
what was your most unforgettable flight , and why does it linger in the memory ?
and if you have any photographs of your aviation accomplishments , email them to : yourpics @ bbc.co.uk this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your comments : i loved flying a cessna 172sp from san juan pr to christiansted , st. croix , or when i bought a ride in a stearman over napa valley ... but the most memorable was in a dc-3 approaching canaima in the venezuelan amazon and circling angel falls ...
rich nasser , minneapolis , mn around five years ago , flying from the main maldives airport out to one of the island atolls in a tiny sea plane that sat around 6 passengers .
the pilot was from canada and to complement his neatly pressed shirt was sporting a cool pair of flip flops ! .
there was even an in flight magazine .
looking down from a few hundred feet -lrb- well it seemed like that -rrb- onto the indian ocean and all the atolls , then coming in to land by what seemed no more than a floating wooden strip about 20 foot square was definately unforgettable .
phil , nimes , france the most memorable thing for me was seeing concorde leave edinburgh airport for the last time ever .
people were openly crying all around me .
very sad .
how nice would it have been to have sent a concorde to the us yesterday to fly over kitty hawk and stamp its presence on history .
ba lets us down again !
gordon , falkirk uk flying low and fast over hartebeespoort dam , south africa , in a saaf puma helicopter ; and doing tactical night landings and take-offs whilst sitting on the cot behind the pilots in a c-160 transall .
my brother-in-law was flying the transall and it was both frightening and thrilling .
sadly he was killed last year test-flying an aerobatic aircraft .
graeme ballantyne , worksop , uk my first soloflight - incredible !
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark being the son of a former airforce- and later on business-pilot , i ´ ve spend countless hours in the cockpit on test flights etc. and , once in a while , on a few days trip around europe .
the most memorable flights i ´ ve had however , was when i joined the danish airforce .
my first soloflight - incredible !
i was flying the saab t-17 supporter , alone !
what a kick !
then came the first loop , roll , high-speed stall etc. etc . - all clear memories from my ' fly-boy-past ' .
i later failed a few tests , and had to leave the course .
oh you lucky guys up there ...
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark easily the most memorable flight of my life was when i visited the tiger moth club 's flying day at woburn abbey some years back as a guest of an old friend of my father 's .
not only did i meet night fighter ace john cunningham , one of my boyhood heroes , but i had a joyride in a tiger moth - complete with flying helmet inna biggles stylee !
guy chapman , reading , uk in october 1998 my girlfriend , now my wife , and i trekked up to everest base camp , starting from lukla at 9,500 ft .
our group of 16 flew from kathmandu to lukla in a light aircraft .
the flight through the snow-capped himalayas was magnificent and then we went into a very steep descent towards the side of a valley to land at lukla , an unmade , 500 metre airstrip on about a 40 degree slope on the side of a mountain !
as we hit the runway the noise of the twin props on reverse pitch and the stones bouncing off the underside of the aircraft were deafening .
the aircraft bounced and thundered up the slope of the runway and somehow managed to stop at the top to the relief of everyone .
it was the best ' white-knuckle ride ' ever !
david salmons , stevenage , hertfordshire i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight giles olley , winchester , uk i learned to fly this year .
my most memorable moment was september 11th 2003 when i flew solo for the first time .
i wo n't quickly forget the thrill of taking off on my own from southampton airport .
the feeling of elation as i successfully landed was incredible .
i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight .
giles olley , winchester , uk i will always remember the first time i went up in a glider .
i must have been about 7 or 8 and my dad took me up over the black mountains and i remember feeling as though i could fly .
emily , sandhurst , berkshire finally getting onto a flight home from the us after september 11th .
very mixed feelings .
getting struck by lightning when coming into land in germany and having to abort landing at the last moment .
flying from barbados to mystique in an 8-seater plane like a flying camper van , feeling completely safe and being able to see the fish in the water below .
kathy , marlborough , uk it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon charlie , oxford , uk i flew in a tiny cessna over miles and miles of the venezuelan jungle to see angel falls , the world 's highest waterfall .
it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon and see water cascading almost 1km to the base .
the falls were discovered by a pilot , jimmy angel - without planes we 'd probably still be unaware of their existence charlie , oxford , uk four years ago in my last weeks of university , my flatmate took us up in a light aircraft from filton , where concorde was partly built .
the views were absolutely incredible on that rare sunny day around bristol , and we wheeled over the river severn to look at a shipwreck .
we could even see a cricket match down below .
the sense of freedom is indescribable , and even in a small plane , the technical achievement of flight remains impressive .
julian , london , uk my most memorable flight was my first solo in a cessna 150 two-seater at age 48 .
i thought it was amazing to be piloting an aircraft all by myself !
bev , canada at the beginning of the 20th century , several countries competed keenly for the schneider trophy - eventually won outright by britain in 1931 with the s6b , a plane which was a forerunner of the spitfire .
this race was restored in the 1980s as part of the national air racing championships , organised by the royal aero club .
in 1991 , i had the honour and thrill of winning the diamond -lrb- 60 -rrb- jubilee schneider trophy air race in my condor aircraft - top speed 122mph !
brian manning , cleobury mortimer , worcs i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my first helicopter flight 13 years ago was the most memorable .
when the helicopter lifted straight up , the way the grass beneath made a radiating pattern from the downwash of the rotors , viewing trees in a forest from just a few feet directly above .
these are both images that i will never forget .
i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight .
russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my aviation memory is actually a memory of hearing my late father describe the 1st airborne division 's landing at arnhem .
many of the gliders crashed , either on takeoff or landing , or over the water on the journey .
he described it as ' sitting in a coffin ' , constantly shaken from side to side , buffeted by winds , feeling sick and frightened and ill .
out of his regiment , less than half made the journey home again .
i am amazed at the bravery of all the men who flew in these gliders .
it took my father some 40 years before he could bear to go near a plane after that .
and i am very proud of him .
kate , wales flying in a piston engine , douglas dc3 dakota from port said down to cairo after a month on an oil rig .
you climb into the plane at the rear and walk up the aisle - a fairly steep climb to your seat , then as the plane takes off the angle totally changes and the aisle becomes level .
that was in 1983 when the planes were getting on for 40 years old and still flying - i bet there are still dc3 dakotas flying commercially even now .
a wonderful plane .
anon , uk eating the smoked mackerel on a ba flight from dusseldorf to manchester , and then spending the rest of the flight with a sick bag and having to make a dash for the loo when we landed .
it seemed like the longest flight ever . !
lou , england when i was still flying to and from canada on a regular basis in the 1980s , i had the rare chance of sitting in the cockpit of a 747 flying to london heathrow .
because i knew a pilot in canada who worked for british airways , i was able to pass on greetings to the captain on this particular flight .
to my surprise , the stewardess who had taken the message said i was ' wanted in the cockpit ' .
it was ' night ' at the time , and , apart from the interesting explanation of most things in the cockpit , i noticed what to me was an amazing display of northern lights .
upon commenting , i was told that the crew , in over 20 years ' flying , had never seen them as they were on that night .
the entire sky was one great light show !
douglas fear , heidelberg , germany it 's easy to forget all the bravery , ideas , skill , and ingenuity people like the wrights and other pioneers who made it possible for those who wanted to fly des east , chelmsford , england when you think of all the millions of people who have ever lived on earth and who wanted to fly .
even now i feel what a very rare privilege it is to be a pilot. and to know i can get into a machine make it leave the earth and come back safely .
flying on an airliner it 's easy to forget all the bravery , ideas , skill , and ingenuity people like the wrights and other pioneers who made it possible for those who wanted to fly the chance to do so .
des east , chelmsford , england when i flew back from mali a couple of years ago , i had malaria .
i was flying alone and feeling so miserable i started crying .
every one around me just stared , no one bothered to ask what was wrong which made me feel worse .
when we arrived my luggage was lost .
it took so long to sort it out that by the time i walked through the gates my sister thought i missed my plane and left so i had to make another 2 hours train ride to get home and i only had my summer clothes on me and this was half october ...
but i had a great time in mali that made it all worthwhile .
leen , belgium i was given a flying lesson in a cessna for my 21st birthday .
i was given total control of the plane from the moment we started taxiing up the runway , and the instructor only took it back as we were coming in to land -lrb- about 20ft off the ground ! -rrb-
the view of my local area from the sky , and the feeling of total exhilaration that i felt to be in control of such a gorgeous machine is one i will never forget .
i am now saving up so that i can do my full ppl some day !
jo , bristol , uk my most memorable flight was flying to australia in 1996 - two things stick in my mind .
the first was flying over india at night , the blackness of the land was broken up by camp fires all over the landscape instead of the artificial light we see over westernised countries , and a huge moon hung in the sky , red from the heat of the day - i can still see the image in my head .
the other memorable moment was flying over the top left hand corner of australia , just beautiful blue ocean , red , red earth and white sandy beaches which went on for miles and miles .
beautiful .
jeni middleton , leeds , uk two spring to mind .
1 .
concorde bay of biscay flight on my 21st birthday 14 yrs ago .
my dad fixed up for me to sit in the jump seat for the landing .
fantastic atmosphere for all on board especially when the old girl hit mach 2 .
when we landed at heathrow i had a smile that made my face hurt .
2 comet - xv814 , last ever flying comet 4b , round the coast of britain when i was apprentice at rae farnborough .
glad to say i flew in first and fastest jet airliners .
nic mccartney , fareham , england my grandma and granddad flying off on honeymoon to holland from liverpool airport in the early 1930s .
it was quite the event in their hometown of bolton and got them in the local paper with a picture of them standing by the plane on the runway , with a headline reading " bolton couple fly " .
the plane looked like it was made out of balsawood .
it was the one and only time in her long life that my grandma flew , despite all the things we told her about the advances they 'd made since those early days .
david walmsley , reading , uk thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk i have just started learning to fly this year and i must say it 's the most fantastic thing i have ever done .
already i have some memories to treasure .
flying over complete overcast in a surreal yet beautiful environment , or at 5000ft as the sun goes down is simply awesome and makes the whole thing worthwhile .
thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk for me a flight coming home from the falkland islands to the uk and i was on the flight deck of the tristar as it crossed the equator and i watched as the dials showed the latitude and longitude readings .
the other must be watching a beautiful sunrise over the south pacific when flying to new zealand from honolulu .
the colours were breathtaking .
david hamilton , barkingside , essex uk when a student pilot , i took off at exeter with concorde on the apron , the red arrows getting ready to line up , and when i made contact with atc , they said to look out for a lancaster , a spitfire and a hurricane in the area .
definitely one to tell the grand-children paul , devon , uk i spent a lot of my childhood in seattle , usa as my father went to work for boeing , and his pet projects were the 747 and 747-400 .
when i was a small child , i would look up at the sky and call any plane in the sky a boeing .
most memorable flight i can remember was on a british airways 747 flight from seattle-tacoma to london heathrow , and i was allowed up in the cockpit .
we were flying over greenland at the time , and although it was the middle of the night , it was broad daylight .
kate , manchester , england i never really liked flying but am now just about used to it !
the last flight was from london to bangkok - a return journey of 24 hours but it was so smooth the seatbelt lights never went on once ... people go on about concorde but i think 747 's are also amazing and quite underrated .
safe flying everyone !
johnny , windsor , windsor , uk i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane paul , colchester , uk although my feet were firmly on terra-firma , my most vivid memory of flight was watching impromptu demonstration by a spitfire during a visit to duxford a few years back .
i can not think of a more perfect marriage of beauty and sheer brute power , despite its sixty years of age the spitfire 's spectacle was the most awesome sight in aviation that i 'd ever seen .
i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane and the almost primeval howl of that rolls royce merlin engine as the pilot flung the machine through a series of tight turns and passes .
paul , colchester , uk i took my first flying lesson yesterday and the instructor let me take control of the aircraft from the moment we were in the air until the final landing approach .
45 minutes buzzing around the skies above my county at 3000 feet - what a rush !
rich , uk of all the aircraft i have flown in , from gliders to large commercial jets , by far and away the best was my flight on concorde .
this is the only aircraft i have flown in where you can positively feel when it speeds up and slows down in the air .
the power felt amazing , plus the view from 58,000 feet and being able to see the darker skies above and the curvature of the earth .
all this whilst sipping champagne .
truly amazing .
i long for the days when i will be able to fly higher and faster .
the views and thrills as an astronaut must be amazing .

rich nasser , minneapolis , mn around five years ago , flying from the main maldives airport out to one of the island atolls in a tiny sea plane that sat around 6 passengers .
the pilot was from canada and to complement his neatly pressed shirt was sporting a cool pair of flip flops ! .
there was even an in flight magazine .
looking down from a few hundred feet -lrb- well it seemed like that -rrb- onto the indian ocean and all the atolls , then coming in to land by what seemed no more than a floating wooden strip about 20 foot square was definately unforgettable .
phil , nimes , france the most memorable thing for me was seeing concorde leave edinburgh airport for the last time ever .
people were openly crying all around me .
very sad .
how nice would it have been to have sent a concorde to the us yesterday to fly over kitty hawk and stamp its presence on history .
ba lets us down again !
gordon , falkirk uk flying low and fast over hartebeespoort dam , south africa , in a saaf puma helicopter ; and doing tactical night landings and take-offs whilst sitting on the cot behind the pilots in a c-160 transall .
my brother-in-law was flying the transall and it was both frightening and thrilling .
sadly he was killed last year test-flying an aerobatic aircraft .
graeme ballantyne , worksop , uk my first soloflight - incredible !
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark being the son of a former airforce- and later on business-pilot , i ´ ve spend countless hours in the cockpit on test flights etc. and , once in a while , on a few days trip around europe .
the most memorable flights i ´ ve had however , was when i joined the danish airforce .
my first soloflight - incredible !
i was flying the saab t-17 supporter , alone !
what a kick !
then came the first loop , roll , high-speed stall etc. etc . - all clear memories from my ' fly-boy-past ' .
i later failed a few tests , and had to leave the course .
oh you lucky guys up there ...
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark easily the most memorable flight of my life was when i visited the tiger moth club 's flying day at woburn abbey some years back as a guest of an old friend of my father 's .
not only did i meet night fighter ace john cunningham , one of my boyhood heroes , but i had a joyride in a tiger moth - complete with flying helmet inna biggles stylee !
guy chapman , reading , uk in october 1998 my girlfriend , now my wife , and i trekked up to everest base camp , starting from lukla at 9,500 ft .
our group of 16 flew from kathmandu to lukla in a light aircraft .
the flight through the snow-capped himalayas was magnificent and then we went into a very steep descent towards the side of a valley to land at lukla , an unmade , 500 metre airstrip on about a 40 degree slope on the side of a mountain !
as we hit the runway the noise of the twin props on reverse pitch and the stones bouncing off the underside of the aircraft were deafening .
the aircraft bounced and thundered up the slope of the runway and somehow managed to stop at the top to the relief of everyone .
it was the best ' white-knuckle ride ' ever !
david salmons , stevenage , hertfordshire i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight giles olley , winchester , uk i learned to fly this year .
my most memorable moment was september 11th 2003 when i flew solo for the first time .
i wo n't quickly forget the thrill of taking off on my own from southampton airport .
the feeling of elation as i successfully landed was incredible .
i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight .
giles olley , winchester , uk i will always remember the first time i went up in a glider .
i must have been about 7 or 8 and my dad took me up over the black mountains and i remember feeling as though i could fly .
emily , sandhurst , berkshire finally getting onto a flight home from the us after september 11th .
very mixed feelings .
getting struck by lightning when coming into land in germany and having to abort landing at the last moment .
flying from barbados to mystique in an 8-seater plane like a flying camper van , feeling completely safe and being able to see the fish in the water below .
kathy , marlborough , uk it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon charlie , oxford , uk i flew in a tiny cessna over miles and miles of the venezuelan jungle to see angel falls , the world 's highest waterfall .

the falls were discovered by a pilot , jimmy angel - without planes we 'd probably still be unaware of their existence charlie , oxford , uk four years ago in my last weeks of university , my flatmate took us up in a light aircraft from filton , where concorde was partly built .
the views were absolutely incredible on that rare sunny day around bristol , and we wheeled over the river severn to look at a shipwreck .
we could even see a cricket match down below .
the sense of freedom is indescribable , and even in a small plane , the technical achievement of flight remains impressive .

my brother-in-law was flying the transall and it was both frightening and thrilling .
sadly he was killed last year test-flying an aerobatic aircraft .
graeme ballantyne , worksop , uk my first soloflight - incredible !
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark being the son of a former airforce- and later on business-pilot , i ´ ve spend countless hours in the cockpit on test flights etc. and , once in a while , on a few days trip around europe .
the most memorable flights i ´ ve had however , was when i joined the danish airforce .
my first soloflight - incredible !
i was flying the saab t-17 supporter , alone !
what a kick !
then came the first loop , roll , high-speed stall etc. etc . - all clear memories from my ' fly-boy-past ' .
i later failed a few tests , and had to leave the course .
oh you lucky guys up there ...
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark easily the most memorable flight of my life was when i visited the tiger moth club 's flying day at woburn abbey some years back as a guest of an old friend of my father 's .
not only did i meet night fighter ace john cunningham , one of my boyhood heroes , but i had a joyride in a tiger moth - complete with flying helmet inna biggles stylee !
guy chapman , reading , uk in october 1998 my girlfriend , now my wife , and i trekked up to everest base camp , starting from lukla at 9,500 ft .
our group of 16 flew from kathmandu to lukla in a light aircraft .
the flight through the snow-capped himalayas was magnificent and then we went into a very steep descent towards the side of a valley to land at lukla , an unmade , 500 metre airstrip on about a 40 degree slope on the side of a mountain !
as we hit the runway the noise of the twin props on reverse pitch and the stones bouncing off the underside of the aircraft were deafening .
the aircraft bounced and thundered up the slope of the runway and somehow managed to stop at the top to the relief of everyone .
it was the best ' white-knuckle ride ' ever !
david salmons , stevenage , hertfordshire i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight giles olley , winchester , uk i learned to fly this year .
my most memorable moment was september 11th 2003 when i flew solo for the first time .
i wo n't quickly forget the thrill of taking off on my own from southampton airport .
the feeling of elation as i successfully landed was incredible .
i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight .
giles olley , winchester , uk i will always remember the first time i went up in a glider .
i must have been about 7 or 8 and my dad took me up over the black mountains and i remember feeling as though i could fly .
emily , sandhurst , berkshire finally getting onto a flight home from the us after september 11th .
very mixed feelings .
getting struck by lightning when coming into land in germany and having to abort landing at the last moment .
flying from barbados to mystique in an 8-seater plane like a flying camper van , feeling completely safe and being able to see the fish in the water below .
kathy , marlborough , uk it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon charlie , oxford , uk i flew in a tiny cessna over miles and miles of the venezuelan jungle to see angel falls , the world 's highest waterfall .
it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon and see water cascading almost 1km to the base .
the falls were discovered by a pilot , jimmy angel - without planes we 'd probably still be unaware of their existence charlie , oxford , uk four years ago in my last weeks of university , my flatmate took us up in a light aircraft from filton , where concorde was partly built .
the views were absolutely incredible on that rare sunny day around bristol , and we wheeled over the river severn to look at a shipwreck .
we could even see a cricket match down below .
the sense of freedom is indescribable , and even in a small plane , the technical achievement of flight remains impressive .
julian , london , uk my most memorable flight was my first solo in a cessna 150 two-seater at age 48 .
i thought it was amazing to be piloting an aircraft all by myself !
bev , canada at the beginning of the 20th century , several countries competed keenly for the schneider trophy - eventually won outright by britain in 1931 with the s6b , a plane which was a forerunner of the spitfire .
this race was restored in the 1980s as part of the national air racing championships , organised by the royal aero club .
in 1991 , i had the honour and thrill of winning the diamond -lrb- 60 -rrb- jubilee schneider trophy air race in my condor aircraft - top speed 122mph !
brian manning , cleobury mortimer , worcs i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my first helicopter flight 13 years ago was the most memorable .
when the helicopter lifted straight up , the way the grass beneath made a radiating pattern from the downwash of the rotors , viewing trees in a forest from just a few feet directly above .
these are both images that i will never forget .
i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight .
russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my aviation memory is actually a memory of hearing my late father describe the 1st airborne division 's landing at arnhem .
many of the gliders crashed , either on takeoff or landing , or over the water on the journey .
he described it as ' sitting in a coffin ' , constantly shaken from side to side , buffeted by winds , feeling sick and frightened and ill .
out of his regiment , less than half made the journey home again .
i am amazed at the bravery of all the men who flew in these gliders .
it took my father some 40 years before he could bear to go near a plane after that .
and i am very proud of him .
kate , wales flying in a piston engine , douglas dc3 dakota from port said down to cairo after a month on an oil rig .
you climb into the plane at the rear and walk up the aisle - a fairly steep climb to your seat , then as the plane takes off the angle totally changes and the aisle becomes level .
that was in 1983 when the planes were getting on for 40 years old and still flying - i bet there are still dc3 dakotas flying commercially even now .
a wonderful plane .
anon , uk eating the smoked mackerel on a ba flight from dusseldorf to manchester , and then spending the rest of the flight with a sick bag and having to make a dash for the loo when we landed .
it seemed like the longest flight ever . !
lou , england when i was still flying to and from canada on a regular basis in the 1980s , i had the rare chance of sitting in the cockpit of a 747 flying to london heathrow .
because i knew a pilot in canada who worked for british airways , i was able to pass on greetings to the captain on this particular flight .
to my surprise , the stewardess who had taken the message said i was ' wanted in the cockpit ' .
it was ' night ' at the time , and , apart from the interesting explanation of most things in the cockpit , i noticed what to me was an amazing display of northern lights .
upon commenting , i was told that the crew , in over 20 years ' flying , had never seen them as they were on that night .
the entire sky was one great light show !
douglas fear , heidelberg , germany it 's easy to forget all the bravery , ideas , skill , and ingenuity people like the wrights and other pioneers who made it possible for those who wanted to fly des east , chelmsford , england when you think of all the millions of people who have ever lived on earth and who wanted to fly .
even now i feel what a very rare privilege it is to be a pilot. and to know i can get into a machine make it leave the earth and come back safely .
flying on an airliner it 's easy to forget all the bravery , ideas , skill , and ingenuity people like the wrights and other pioneers who made it possible for those who wanted to fly the chance to do so .
des east , chelmsford , england when i flew back from mali a couple of years ago , i had malaria .
i was flying alone and feeling so miserable i started crying .
every one around me just stared , no one bothered to ask what was wrong which made me feel worse .
when we arrived my luggage was lost .
it took so long to sort it out that by the time i walked through the gates my sister thought i missed my plane and left so i had to make another 2 hours train ride to get home and i only had my summer clothes on me and this was half october ...
but i had a great time in mali that made it all worthwhile .
leen , belgium i was given a flying lesson in a cessna for my 21st birthday .
i was given total control of the plane from the moment we started taxiing up the runway , and the instructor only took it back as we were coming in to land -lrb- about 20ft off the ground ! -rrb-
the view of my local area from the sky , and the feeling of total exhilaration that i felt to be in control of such a gorgeous machine is one i will never forget .
i am now saving up so that i can do my full ppl some day !
jo , bristol , uk my most memorable flight was flying to australia in 1996 - two things stick in my mind .
the first was flying over india at night , the blackness of the land was broken up by camp fires all over the landscape instead of the artificial light we see over westernised countries , and a huge moon hung in the sky , red from the heat of the day - i can still see the image in my head .
the other memorable moment was flying over the top left hand corner of australia , just beautiful blue ocean , red , red earth and white sandy beaches which went on for miles and miles .
beautiful .
jeni middleton , leeds , uk two spring to mind .
1 .
concorde bay of biscay flight on my 21st birthday 14 yrs ago .
my dad fixed up for me to sit in the jump seat for the landing .
fantastic atmosphere for all on board especially when the old girl hit mach 2 .
when we landed at heathrow i had a smile that made my face hurt .
2 comet - xv814 , last ever flying comet 4b , round the coast of britain when i was apprentice at rae farnborough .
glad to say i flew in first and fastest jet airliners .
nic mccartney , fareham , england my grandma and granddad flying off on honeymoon to holland from liverpool airport in the early 1930s .
it was quite the event in their hometown of bolton and got them in the local paper with a picture of them standing by the plane on the runway , with a headline reading " bolton couple fly " .
the plane looked like it was made out of balsawood .
it was the one and only time in her long life that my grandma flew , despite all the things we told her about the advances they 'd made since those early days .
david walmsley , reading , uk thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk i have just started learning to fly this year and i must say it 's the most fantastic thing i have ever done .
already i have some memories to treasure .
flying over complete overcast in a surreal yet beautiful environment , or at 5000ft as the sun goes down is simply awesome and makes the whole thing worthwhile .
thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk for me a flight coming home from the falkland islands to the uk and i was on the flight deck of the tristar as it crossed the equator and i watched as the dials showed the latitude and longitude readings .
the other must be watching a beautiful sunrise over the south pacific when flying to new zealand from honolulu .
the colours were breathtaking .
david hamilton , barkingside , essex uk when a student pilot , i took off at exeter with concorde on the apron , the red arrows getting ready to line up , and when i made contact with atc , they said to look out for a lancaster , a spitfire and a hurricane in the area .
definitely one to tell the grand-children paul , devon , uk i spent a lot of my childhood in seattle , usa as my father went to work for boeing , and his pet projects were the 747 and 747-400 .
when i was a small child , i would look up at the sky and call any plane in the sky a boeing .
most memorable flight i can remember was on a british airways 747 flight from seattle-tacoma to london heathrow , and i was allowed up in the cockpit .
we were flying over greenland at the time , and although it was the middle of the night , it was broad daylight .
kate , manchester , england i never really liked flying but am now just about used to it !
the last flight was from london to bangkok - a return journey of 24 hours but it was so smooth the seatbelt lights never went on once ... people go on about concorde but i think 747 's are also amazing and quite underrated .
safe flying everyone !
johnny , windsor , windsor , uk i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane paul , colchester , uk although my feet were firmly on terra-firma , my most vivid memory of flight was watching impromptu demonstration by a spitfire during a visit to duxford a few years back .
i can not think of a more perfect marriage of beauty and sheer brute power , despite its sixty years of age the spitfire 's spectacle was the most awesome sight in aviation that i 'd ever seen .
i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane and the almost primeval howl of that rolls royce merlin engine as the pilot flung the machine through a series of tight turns and passes .
paul , colchester , uk i took my first flying lesson yesterday and the instructor let me take control of the aircraft from the moment we were in the air until the final landing approach .
45 minutes buzzing around the skies above my county at 3000 feet - what a rush !
rich , uk of all the aircraft i have flown in , from gliders to large commercial jets , by far and away the best was my flight on concorde .
this is the only aircraft i have flown in where you can positively feel when it speeds up and slows down in the air .
the power felt amazing , plus the view from 58,000 feet and being able to see the darker skies above and the curvature of the earth .
all this whilst sipping champagne .
truly amazing .
i long for the days when i will be able to fly higher and faster .
the views and thrills as an astronaut must be amazing .

your comments : i loved flying a cessna 172sp from san juan pr to christiansted , st. croix , or when i bought a ride in a stearman over napa valley ... but the most memorable was in a dc-3 approaching canaima in the venezuelan amazon and circling angel falls ...
rich nasser , minneapolis , mn around five years ago , flying from the main maldives airport out to one of the island atolls in a tiny sea plane that sat around 6 passengers .
the pilot was from canada and to complement his neatly pressed shirt was sporting a cool pair of flip flops ! .
there was even an in flight magazine .
looking down from a few hundred feet -lrb- well it seemed like that -rrb- onto the indian ocean and all the atolls , then coming in to land by what seemed no more than a floating wooden strip about 20 foot square was definately unforgettable .
phil , nimes , france the most memorable thing for me was seeing concorde leave edinburgh airport for the last time ever .
people were openly crying all around me .
very sad .
how nice would it have been to have sent a concorde to the us yesterday to fly over kitty hawk and stamp its presence on history .
ba lets us down again !

your comments : i loved flying a cessna 172sp from san juan pr to christiansted , st. croix , or when i bought a ride in a stearman over napa valley ... but the most memorable was in a dc-3 approaching canaima in the venezuelan amazon and circling angel falls ...
rich nasser , minneapolis , mn around five years ago , flying from the main maldives airport out to one of the island atolls in a tiny sea plane that sat around 6 passengers .
the pilot was from canada and to complement his neatly pressed shirt was sporting a cool pair of flip flops ! .
there was even an in flight magazine .
looking down from a few hundred feet -lrb- well it seemed like that -rrb- onto the indian ocean and all the atolls , then coming in to land by what seemed no more than a floating wooden strip about 20 foot square was definately unforgettable .
phil , nimes , france the most memorable thing for me was seeing concorde leave edinburgh airport for the last time ever .
people were openly crying all around me .
very sad .
how nice would it have been to have sent a concorde to the us yesterday to fly over kitty hawk and stamp its presence on history .
ba lets us down again !
gordon , falkirk uk flying low and fast over hartebeespoort dam , south africa , in a saaf puma helicopter ; and doing tactical night landings and take-offs whilst sitting on the cot behind the pilots in a c-160 transall .
my brother-in-law was flying the transall and it was both frightening and thrilling .
sadly he was killed last year test-flying an aerobatic aircraft .
graeme ballantyne , worksop , uk my first soloflight - incredible !
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark being the son of a former airforce- and later on business-pilot , i ´ ve spend countless hours in the cockpit on test flights etc. and , once in a while , on a few days trip around europe .
the most memorable flights i ´ ve had however , was when i joined the danish airforce .
my first soloflight - incredible !
i was flying the saab t-17 supporter , alone !
what a kick !
then came the first loop , roll , high-speed stall etc. etc . - all clear memories from my ' fly-boy-past ' .
i later failed a few tests , and had to leave the course .
oh you lucky guys up there ...
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark easily the most memorable flight of my life was when i visited the tiger moth club 's flying day at woburn abbey some years back as a guest of an old friend of my father 's .
not only did i meet night fighter ace john cunningham , one of my boyhood heroes , but i had a joyride in a tiger moth - complete with flying helmet inna biggles stylee !
guy chapman , reading , uk in october 1998 my girlfriend , now my wife , and i trekked up to everest base camp , starting from lukla at 9,500 ft .
our group of 16 flew from kathmandu to lukla in a light aircraft .
the flight through the snow-capped himalayas was magnificent and then we went into a very steep descent towards the side of a valley to land at lukla , an unmade , 500 metre airstrip on about a 40 degree slope on the side of a mountain !
as we hit the runway the noise of the twin props on reverse pitch and the stones bouncing off the underside of the aircraft were deafening .
the aircraft bounced and thundered up the slope of the runway and somehow managed to stop at the top to the relief of everyone .
it was the best ' white-knuckle ride ' ever !
david salmons , stevenage , hertfordshire i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight giles olley , winchester , uk i learned to fly this year .
my most memorable moment was september 11th 2003 when i flew solo for the first time .
i wo n't quickly forget the thrill of taking off on my own from southampton airport .
the feeling of elation as i successfully landed was incredible .
i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight .
giles olley , winchester , uk i will always remember the first time i went up in a glider .
i must have been about 7 or 8 and my dad took me up over the black mountains and i remember feeling as though i could fly .
emily , sandhurst , berkshire finally getting onto a flight home from the us after september 11th .
very mixed feelings .
getting struck by lightning when coming into land in germany and having to abort landing at the last moment .
flying from barbados to mystique in an 8-seater plane like a flying camper van , feeling completely safe and being able to see the fish in the water below .
kathy , marlborough , uk it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon charlie , oxford , uk i flew in a tiny cessna over miles and miles of the venezuelan jungle to see angel falls , the world 's highest waterfall .
it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon and see water cascading almost 1km to the base .
the falls were discovered by a pilot , jimmy angel - without planes we 'd probably still be unaware of their existence charlie , oxford , uk four years ago in my last weeks of university , my flatmate took us up in a light aircraft from filton , where concorde was partly built .
the views were absolutely incredible on that rare sunny day around bristol , and we wheeled over the river severn to look at a shipwreck .
we could even see a cricket match down below .
the sense of freedom is indescribable , and even in a small plane , the technical achievement of flight remains impressive .
julian , london , uk my most memorable flight was my first solo in a cessna 150 two-seater at age 48 .
i thought it was amazing to be piloting an aircraft all by myself !
bev , canada at the beginning of the 20th century , several countries competed keenly for the schneider trophy - eventually won outright by britain in 1931 with the s6b , a plane which was a forerunner of the spitfire .
this race was restored in the 1980s as part of the national air racing championships , organised by the royal aero club .
in 1991 , i had the honour and thrill of winning the diamond -lrb- 60 -rrb- jubilee schneider trophy air race in my condor aircraft - top speed 122mph !
brian manning , cleobury mortimer , worcs i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my first helicopter flight 13 years ago was the most memorable .
when the helicopter lifted straight up , the way the grass beneath made a radiating pattern from the downwash of the rotors , viewing trees in a forest from just a few feet directly above .
these are both images that i will never forget .
i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight .
russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my aviation memory is actually a memory of hearing my late father describe the 1st airborne division 's landing at arnhem .
many of the gliders crashed , either on takeoff or landing , or over the water on the journey .
he described it as ' sitting in a coffin ' , constantly shaken from side to side , buffeted by winds , feeling sick and frightened and ill .
out of his regiment , less than half made the journey home again .
i am amazed at the bravery of all the men who flew in these gliders .
it took my father some 40 years before he could bear to go near a plane after that .
and i am very proud of him .
kate , wales flying in a piston engine , douglas dc3 dakota from port said down to cairo after a month on an oil rig .
you climb into the plane at the rear and walk up the aisle - a fairly steep climb to your seat , then as the plane takes off the angle totally changes and the aisle becomes level .
that was in 1983 when the planes were getting on for 40 years old and still flying - i bet there are still dc3 dakotas flying commercially even now .
a wonderful plane .
anon , uk eating the smoked mackerel on a ba flight from dusseldorf to manchester , and then spending the rest of the flight with a sick bag and having to make a dash for the loo when we landed .
it seemed like the longest flight ever . !
lou , england when i was still flying to and from canada on a regular basis in the 1980s , i had the rare chance of sitting in the cockpit of a 747 flying to london heathrow .
because i knew a pilot in canada who worked for british airways , i was able to pass on greetings to the captain on this particular flight .
to my surprise , the stewardess who had taken the message said i was ' wanted in the cockpit ' .
it was ' night ' at the time , and , apart from the interesting explanation of most things in the cockpit , i noticed what to me was an amazing display of northern lights .
upon commenting , i was told that the crew , in over 20 years ' flying , had never seen them as they were on that night .
the entire sky was one great light show !
douglas fear , heidelberg , germany it 's easy to forget all the bravery , ideas , skill , and ingenuity people like the wrights and other pioneers who made it possible for those who wanted to fly des east , chelmsford , england when you think of all the millions of people who have ever lived on earth and who wanted to fly .
even now i feel what a very rare privilege it is to be a pilot. and to know i can get into a machine make it leave the earth and come back safely .
flying on an airliner it 's easy to forget all the bravery , ideas , skill , and ingenuity people like the wrights and other pioneers who made it possible for those who wanted to fly the chance to do so .
des east , chelmsford , england when i flew back from mali a couple of years ago , i had malaria .
i was flying alone and feeling so miserable i started crying .
every one around me just stared , no one bothered to ask what was wrong which made me feel worse .
when we arrived my luggage was lost .
it took so long to sort it out that by the time i walked through the gates my sister thought i missed my plane and left so i had to make another 2 hours train ride to get home and i only had my summer clothes on me and this was half october ...
but i had a great time in mali that made it all worthwhile .
leen , belgium i was given a flying lesson in a cessna for my 21st birthday .
i was given total control of the plane from the moment we started taxiing up the runway , and the instructor only took it back as we were coming in to land -lrb- about 20ft off the ground ! -rrb-
the view of my local area from the sky , and the feeling of total exhilaration that i felt to be in control of such a gorgeous machine is one i will never forget .
i am now saving up so that i can do my full ppl some day !
jo , bristol , uk my most memorable flight was flying to australia in 1996 - two things stick in my mind .
the first was flying over india at night , the blackness of the land was broken up by camp fires all over the landscape instead of the artificial light we see over westernised countries , and a huge moon hung in the sky , red from the heat of the day - i can still see the image in my head .
the other memorable moment was flying over the top left hand corner of australia , just beautiful blue ocean , red , red earth and white sandy beaches which went on for miles and miles .
beautiful .
jeni middleton , leeds , uk two spring to mind .
1 .
concorde bay of biscay flight on my 21st birthday 14 yrs ago .
my dad fixed up for me to sit in the jump seat for the landing .
fantastic atmosphere for all on board especially when the old girl hit mach 2 .
when we landed at heathrow i had a smile that made my face hurt .
2 comet - xv814 , last ever flying comet 4b , round the coast of britain when i was apprentice at rae farnborough .
glad to say i flew in first and fastest jet airliners .
nic mccartney , fareham , england my grandma and granddad flying off on honeymoon to holland from liverpool airport in the early 1930s .
it was quite the event in their hometown of bolton and got them in the local paper with a picture of them standing by the plane on the runway , with a headline reading " bolton couple fly " .
the plane looked like it was made out of balsawood .
it was the one and only time in her long life that my grandma flew , despite all the things we told her about the advances they 'd made since those early days .
david walmsley , reading , uk thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk i have just started learning to fly this year and i must say it 's the most fantastic thing i have ever done .
already i have some memories to treasure .
flying over complete overcast in a surreal yet beautiful environment , or at 5000ft as the sun goes down is simply awesome and makes the whole thing worthwhile .
thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk for me a flight coming home from the falkland islands to the uk and i was on the flight deck of the tristar as it crossed the equator and i watched as the dials showed the latitude and longitude readings .
the other must be watching a beautiful sunrise over the south pacific when flying to new zealand from honolulu .
the colours were breathtaking .
david hamilton , barkingside , essex uk when a student pilot , i took off at exeter with concorde on the apron , the red arrows getting ready to line up , and when i made contact with atc , they said to look out for a lancaster , a spitfire and a hurricane in the area .
definitely one to tell the grand-children paul , devon , uk i spent a lot of my childhood in seattle , usa as my father went to work for boeing , and his pet projects were the 747 and 747-400 .
when i was a small child , i would look up at the sky and call any plane in the sky a boeing .
most memorable flight i can remember was on a british airways 747 flight from seattle-tacoma to london heathrow , and i was allowed up in the cockpit .
we were flying over greenland at the time , and although it was the middle of the night , it was broad daylight .
kate , manchester , england i never really liked flying but am now just about used to it !
the last flight was from london to bangkok - a return journey of 24 hours but it was so smooth the seatbelt lights never went on once ... people go on about concorde but i think 747 's are also amazing and quite underrated .
safe flying everyone !
johnny , windsor , windsor , uk i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane paul , colchester , uk although my feet were firmly on terra-firma , my most vivid memory of flight was watching impromptu demonstration by a spitfire during a visit to duxford a few years back .
i can not think of a more perfect marriage of beauty and sheer brute power , despite its sixty years of age the spitfire 's spectacle was the most awesome sight in aviation that i 'd ever seen .
i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane and the almost primeval howl of that rolls royce merlin engine as the pilot flung the machine through a series of tight turns and passes .
paul , colchester , uk i took my first flying lesson yesterday and the instructor let me take control of the aircraft from the moment we were in the air until the final landing approach .
45 minutes buzzing around the skies above my county at 3000 feet - what a rush !
rich , uk of all the aircraft i have flown in , from gliders to large commercial jets , by far and away the best was my flight on concorde .
this is the only aircraft i have flown in where you can positively feel when it speeds up and slows down in the air .
the power felt amazing , plus the view from 58,000 feet and being able to see the darker skies above and the curvature of the earth .
all this whilst sipping champagne .
truly amazing .
i long for the days when i will be able to fly higher and faster .
the views and thrills as an astronaut must be amazing .

thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk for me a flight coming home from the falkland islands to the uk and i was on the flight deck of the tristar as it crossed the equator and i watched as the dials showed the latitude and longitude readings .
the other must be watching a beautiful sunrise over the south pacific when flying to new zealand from honolulu .
the colours were breathtaking .
david hamilton , barkingside , essex uk when a student pilot , i took off at exeter with concorde on the apron , the red arrows getting ready to line up , and when i made contact with atc , they said to look out for a lancaster , a spitfire and a hurricane in the area .
definitely one to tell the grand-children paul , devon , uk i spent a lot of my childhood in seattle , usa as my father went to work for boeing , and his pet projects were the 747 and 747-400 .
when i was a small child , i would look up at the sky and call any plane in the sky a boeing .
most memorable flight i can remember was on a british airways 747 flight from seattle-tacoma to london heathrow , and i was allowed up in the cockpit .
we were flying over greenland at the time , and although it was the middle of the night , it was broad daylight .
kate , manchester , england i never really liked flying but am now just about used to it !
the last flight was from london to bangkok - a return journey of 24 hours but it was so smooth the seatbelt lights never went on once ... people go on about concorde but i think 747 's are also amazing and quite underrated .
safe flying everyone !
johnny , windsor , windsor , uk i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane paul , colchester , uk although my feet were firmly on terra-firma , my most vivid memory of flight was watching impromptu demonstration by a spitfire during a visit to duxford a few years back .
i can not think of a more perfect marriage of beauty and sheer brute power , despite its sixty years of age the spitfire 's spectacle was the most awesome sight in aviation that i 'd ever seen .
i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane and the almost primeval howl of that rolls royce merlin engine as the pilot flung the machine through a series of tight turns and passes .
paul , colchester , uk i took my first flying lesson yesterday and the instructor let me take control of the aircraft from the moment we were in the air until the final landing approach .
45 minutes buzzing around the skies above my county at 3000 feet - what a rush !
rich , uk of all the aircraft i have flown in , from gliders to large commercial jets , by far and away the best was my flight on concorde .
this is the only aircraft i have flown in where you can positively feel when it speeds up and slows down in the air .
the power felt amazing , plus the view from 58,000 feet and being able to see the darker skies above and the curvature of the earth .
all this whilst sipping champagne .
truly amazing .
i long for the days when i will be able to fly higher and faster .
the views and thrills as an astronaut must be amazing .

your comments : i loved flying a cessna 172sp from san juan pr to christiansted , st. croix , or when i bought a ride in a stearman over napa valley ... but the most memorable was in a dc-3 approaching canaima in the venezuelan amazon and circling angel falls ...
rich nasser , minneapolis , mn around five years ago , flying from the main maldives airport out to one of the island atolls in a tiny sea plane that sat around 6 passengers .
the pilot was from canada and to complement his neatly pressed shirt was sporting a cool pair of flip flops ! .
there was even an in flight magazine .
looking down from a few hundred feet -lrb- well it seemed like that -rrb- onto the indian ocean and all the atolls , then coming in to land by what seemed no more than a floating wooden strip about 20 foot square was definately unforgettable .
phil , nimes , france the most memorable thing for me was seeing concorde leave edinburgh airport for the last time ever .
people were openly crying all around me .
very sad .
how nice would it have been to have sent a concorde to the us yesterday to fly over kitty hawk and stamp its presence on history .
ba lets us down again !
gordon , falkirk uk flying low and fast over hartebeespoort dam , south africa , in a saaf puma helicopter ; and doing tactical night landings and take-offs whilst sitting on the cot behind the pilots in a c-160 transall .
my brother-in-law was flying the transall and it was both frightening and thrilling .
sadly he was killed last year test-flying an aerobatic aircraft .
graeme ballantyne , worksop , uk my first soloflight - incredible !
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark being the son of a former airforce- and later on business-pilot , i ´ ve spend countless hours in the cockpit on test flights etc. and , once in a while , on a few days trip around europe .
the most memorable flights i ´ ve had however , was when i joined the danish airforce .
my first soloflight - incredible !
i was flying the saab t-17 supporter , alone !
what a kick !
then came the first loop , roll , high-speed stall etc. etc . - all clear memories from my ' fly-boy-past ' .
i later failed a few tests , and had to leave the course .
oh you lucky guys up there ...
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark easily the most memorable flight of my life was when i visited the tiger moth club 's flying day at woburn abbey some years back as a guest of an old friend of my father 's .
not only did i meet night fighter ace john cunningham , one of my boyhood heroes , but i had a joyride in a tiger moth - complete with flying helmet inna biggles stylee !
guy chapman , reading , uk in october 1998 my girlfriend , now my wife , and i trekked up to everest base camp , starting from lukla at 9,500 ft .
our group of 16 flew from kathmandu to lukla in a light aircraft .
the flight through the snow-capped himalayas was magnificent and then we went into a very steep descent towards the side of a valley to land at lukla , an unmade , 500 metre airstrip on about a 40 degree slope on the side of a mountain !
as we hit the runway the noise of the twin props on reverse pitch and the stones bouncing off the underside of the aircraft were deafening .
the aircraft bounced and thundered up the slope of the runway and somehow managed to stop at the top to the relief of everyone .
it was the best ' white-knuckle ride ' ever !
david salmons , stevenage , hertfordshire i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight giles olley , winchester , uk i learned to fly this year .
my most memorable moment was september 11th 2003 when i flew solo for the first time .
i wo n't quickly forget the thrill of taking off on my own from southampton airport .
the feeling of elation as i successfully landed was incredible .
i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight .
giles olley , winchester , uk i will always remember the first time i went up in a glider .
i must have been about 7 or 8 and my dad took me up over the black mountains and i remember feeling as though i could fly .
emily , sandhurst , berkshire finally getting onto a flight home from the us after september 11th .
very mixed feelings .
getting struck by lightning when coming into land in germany and having to abort landing at the last moment .
flying from barbados to mystique in an 8-seater plane like a flying camper van , feeling completely safe and being able to see the fish in the water below .
kathy , marlborough , uk it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon charlie , oxford , uk i flew in a tiny cessna over miles and miles of the venezuelan jungle to see angel falls , the world 's highest waterfall .
it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon and see water cascading almost 1km to the base .
the falls were discovered by a pilot , jimmy angel - without planes we 'd probably still be unaware of their existence charlie , oxford , uk four years ago in my last weeks of university , my flatmate took us up in a light aircraft from filton , where concorde was partly built .
the views were absolutely incredible on that rare sunny day around bristol , and we wheeled over the river severn to look at a shipwreck .
we could even see a cricket match down below .
the sense of freedom is indescribable , and even in a small plane , the technical achievement of flight remains impressive .
julian , london , uk my most memorable flight was my first solo in a cessna 150 two-seater at age 48 .
i thought it was amazing to be piloting an aircraft all by myself !
bev , canada at the beginning of the 20th century , several countries competed keenly for the schneider trophy - eventually won outright by britain in 1931 with the s6b , a plane which was a forerunner of the spitfire .
this race was restored in the 1980s as part of the national air racing championships , organised by the royal aero club .
in 1991 , i had the honour and thrill of winning the diamond -lrb- 60 -rrb- jubilee schneider trophy air race in my condor aircraft - top speed 122mph !
brian manning , cleobury mortimer , worcs i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my first helicopter flight 13 years ago was the most memorable .
when the helicopter lifted straight up , the way the grass beneath made a radiating pattern from the downwash of the rotors , viewing trees in a forest from just a few feet directly above .
these are both images that i will never forget .
i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight .
russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my aviation memory is actually a memory of hearing my late father describe the 1st airborne division 's landing at arnhem .
many of the gliders crashed , either on takeoff or landing , or over the water on the journey .
he described it as ' sitting in a coffin ' , constantly shaken from side to side , buffeted by winds , feeling sick and frightened and ill .
out of his regiment , less than half made the journey home again .
i am amazed at the bravery of all the men who flew in these gliders .
it took my father some 40 years before he could bear to go near a plane after that .
and i am very proud of him .
kate , wales flying in a piston engine , douglas dc3 dakota from port said down to cairo after a month on an oil rig .
you climb into the plane at the rear and walk up the aisle - a fairly steep climb to your seat , then as the plane takes off the angle totally changes and the aisle becomes level .
that was in 1983 when the planes were getting on for 40 years old and still flying - i bet there are still dc3 dakotas flying commercially even now .
a wonderful plane .
anon , uk eating the smoked mackerel on a ba flight from dusseldorf to manchester , and then spending the rest of the flight with a sick bag and having to make a dash for the loo when we landed .
it seemed like the longest flight ever . !
lou , england when i was still flying to and from canada on a regular basis in the 1980s , i had the rare chance of sitting in the cockpit of a 747 flying to london heathrow .
because i knew a pilot in canada who worked for british airways , i was able to pass on greetings to the captain on this particular flight .
to my surprise , the stewardess who had taken the message said i was ' wanted in the cockpit ' .
it was ' night ' at the time , and , apart from the interesting explanation of most things in the cockpit , i noticed what to me was an amazing display of northern lights .
upon commenting , i was told that the crew , in over 20 years ' flying , had never seen them as they were on that night .
the entire sky was one great light show !
douglas fear , heidelberg , germany it 's easy to forget all the bravery , ideas , skill , and ingenuity people like the wrights and other pioneers who made it possible for those who wanted to fly des east , chelmsford , england when you think of all the millions of people who have ever lived on earth and who wanted to fly .
even now i feel what a very rare privilege it is to be a pilot. and to know i can get into a machine make it leave the earth and come back safely .
flying on an airliner it 's easy to forget all the bravery , ideas , skill , and ingenuity people like the wrights and other pioneers who made it possible for those who wanted to fly the chance to do so .
des east , chelmsford , england when i flew back from mali a couple of years ago , i had malaria .
i was flying alone and feeling so miserable i started crying .
every one around me just stared , no one bothered to ask what was wrong which made me feel worse .
when we arrived my luggage was lost .
it took so long to sort it out that by the time i walked through the gates my sister thought i missed my plane and left so i had to make another 2 hours train ride to get home and i only had my summer clothes on me and this was half october ...
but i had a great time in mali that made it all worthwhile .
leen , belgium i was given a flying lesson in a cessna for my 21st birthday .
i was given total control of the plane from the moment we started taxiing up the runway , and the instructor only took it back as we were coming in to land -lrb- about 20ft off the ground ! -rrb-
the view of my local area from the sky , and the feeling of total exhilaration that i felt to be in control of such a gorgeous machine is one i will never forget .
i am now saving up so that i can do my full ppl some day !
jo , bristol , uk my most memorable flight was flying to australia in 1996 - two things stick in my mind .
the first was flying over india at night , the blackness of the land was broken up by camp fires all over the landscape instead of the artificial light we see over westernised countries , and a huge moon hung in the sky , red from the heat of the day - i can still see the image in my head .
the other memorable moment was flying over the top left hand corner of australia , just beautiful blue ocean , red , red earth and white sandy beaches which went on for miles and miles .
beautiful .
jeni middleton , leeds , uk two spring to mind .
1 .
concorde bay of biscay flight on my 21st birthday 14 yrs ago .
my dad fixed up for me to sit in the jump seat for the landing .
fantastic atmosphere for all on board especially when the old girl hit mach 2 .
when we landed at heathrow i had a smile that made my face hurt .
2 comet - xv814 , last ever flying comet 4b , round the coast of britain when i was apprentice at rae farnborough .
glad to say i flew in first and fastest jet airliners .
nic mccartney , fareham , england my grandma and granddad flying off on honeymoon to holland from liverpool airport in the early 1930s .
it was quite the event in their hometown of bolton and got them in the local paper with a picture of them standing by the plane on the runway , with a headline reading " bolton couple fly " .
the plane looked like it was made out of balsawood .
it was the one and only time in her long life that my grandma flew , despite all the things we told her about the advances they 'd made since those early days .
david walmsley , reading , uk thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk i have just started learning to fly this year and i must say it 's the most fantastic thing i have ever done .
already i have some memories to treasure .
flying over complete overcast in a surreal yet beautiful environment , or at 5000ft as the sun goes down is simply awesome and makes the whole thing worthwhile .
thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk for me a flight coming home from the falkland islands to the uk and i was on the flight deck of the tristar as it crossed the equator and i watched as the dials showed the latitude and longitude readings .
the other must be watching a beautiful sunrise over the south pacific when flying to new zealand from honolulu .
the colours were breathtaking .
david hamilton , barkingside , essex uk when a student pilot , i took off at exeter with concorde on the apron , the red arrows getting ready to line up , and when i made contact with atc , they said to look out for a lancaster , a spitfire and a hurricane in the area .
definitely one to tell the grand-children paul , devon , uk i spent a lot of my childhood in seattle , usa as my father went to work for boeing , and his pet projects were the 747 and 747-400 .
when i was a small child , i would look up at the sky and call any plane in the sky a boeing .
most memorable flight i can remember was on a british airways 747 flight from seattle-tacoma to london heathrow , and i was allowed up in the cockpit .
we were flying over greenland at the time , and although it was the middle of the night , it was broad daylight .
kate , manchester , england i never really liked flying but am now just about used to it !
the last flight was from london to bangkok - a return journey of 24 hours but it was so smooth the seatbelt lights never went on once ... people go on about concorde but i think 747 's are also amazing and quite underrated .
safe flying everyone !
johnny , windsor , windsor , uk i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane paul , colchester , uk although my feet were firmly on terra-firma , my most vivid memory of flight was watching impromptu demonstration by a spitfire during a visit to duxford a few years back .
i can not think of a more perfect marriage of beauty and sheer brute power , despite its sixty years of age the spitfire 's spectacle was the most awesome sight in aviation that i 'd ever seen .
i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane and the almost primeval howl of that rolls royce merlin engine as the pilot flung the machine through a series of tight turns and passes .
paul , colchester , uk i took my first flying lesson yesterday and the instructor let me take control of the aircraft from the moment we were in the air until the final landing approach .

flying on an airliner it 's easy to forget all the bravery , ideas , skill , and ingenuity people like the wrights and other pioneers who made it possible for those who wanted to fly the chance to do so .
des east , chelmsford , england when i flew back from mali a couple of years ago , i had malaria .
i was flying alone and feeling so miserable i started crying .
every one around me just stared , no one bothered to ask what was wrong which made me feel worse .
when we arrived my luggage was lost .
it took so long to sort it out that by the time i walked through the gates my sister thought i missed my plane and left so i had to make another 2 hours train ride to get home and i only had my summer clothes on me and this was half october ...
but i had a great time in mali that made it all worthwhile .
leen , belgium i was given a flying lesson in a cessna for my 21st birthday .
i was given total control of the plane from the moment we started taxiing up the runway , and the instructor only took it back as we were coming in to land -lrb- about 20ft off the ground ! -rrb-
the view of my local area from the sky , and the feeling of total exhilaration that i felt to be in control of such a gorgeous machine is one i will never forget .
i am now saving up so that i can do my full ppl some day !
jo , bristol , uk my most memorable flight was flying to australia in 1996 - two things stick in my mind .
the first was flying over india at night , the blackness of the land was broken up by camp fires all over the landscape instead of the artificial light we see over westernised countries , and a huge moon hung in the sky , red from the heat of the day - i can still see the image in my head .
the other memorable moment was flying over the top left hand corner of australia , just beautiful blue ocean , red , red earth and white sandy beaches which went on for miles and miles .
beautiful .
jeni middleton , leeds , uk two spring to mind .
1 .
concorde bay of biscay flight on my 21st birthday 14 yrs ago .
my dad fixed up for me to sit in the jump seat for the landing .
fantastic atmosphere for all on board especially when the old girl hit mach 2 .
when we landed at heathrow i had a smile that made my face hurt .
2 comet - xv814 , last ever flying comet 4b , round the coast of britain when i was apprentice at rae farnborough .
glad to say i flew in first and fastest jet airliners .
nic mccartney , fareham , england my grandma and granddad flying off on honeymoon to holland from liverpool airport in the early 1930s .
it was quite the event in their hometown of bolton and got them in the local paper with a picture of them standing by the plane on the runway , with a headline reading " bolton couple fly " .
the plane looked like it was made out of balsawood .
it was the one and only time in her long life that my grandma flew , despite all the things we told her about the advances they 'd made since those early days .
david walmsley , reading , uk thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk i have just started learning to fly this year and i must say it 's the most fantastic thing i have ever done .
already i have some memories to treasure .
flying over complete overcast in a surreal yet beautiful environment , or at 5000ft as the sun goes down is simply awesome and makes the whole thing worthwhile .
thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk for me a flight coming home from the falkland islands to the uk and i was on the flight deck of the tristar as it crossed the equator and i watched as the dials showed the latitude and longitude readings .
the other must be watching a beautiful sunrise over the south pacific when flying to new zealand from honolulu .
the colours were breathtaking .
david hamilton , barkingside , essex uk when a student pilot , i took off at exeter with concorde on the apron , the red arrows getting ready to line up , and when i made contact with atc , they said to look out for a lancaster , a spitfire and a hurricane in the area .
definitely one to tell the grand-children paul , devon , uk i spent a lot of my childhood in seattle , usa as my father went to work for boeing , and his pet projects were the 747 and 747-400 .
when i was a small child , i would look up at the sky and call any plane in the sky a boeing .
most memorable flight i can remember was on a british airways 747 flight from seattle-tacoma to london heathrow , and i was allowed up in the cockpit .
we were flying over greenland at the time , and although it was the middle of the night , it was broad daylight .
kate , manchester , england i never really liked flying but am now just about used to it !
the last flight was from london to bangkok - a return journey of 24 hours but it was so smooth the seatbelt lights never went on once ... people go on about concorde but i think 747 's are also amazing and quite underrated .
safe flying everyone !
johnny , windsor , windsor , uk i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane paul , colchester , uk although my feet were firmly on terra-firma , my most vivid memory of flight was watching impromptu demonstration by a spitfire during a visit to duxford a few years back .
i can not think of a more perfect marriage of beauty and sheer brute power , despite its sixty years of age the spitfire 's spectacle was the most awesome sight in aviation that i 'd ever seen .
i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane and the almost primeval howl of that rolls royce merlin engine as the pilot flung the machine through a series of tight turns and passes .
paul , colchester , uk i took my first flying lesson yesterday and the instructor let me take control of the aircraft from the moment we were in the air until the final landing approach .
45 minutes buzzing around the skies above my county at 3000 feet - what a rush !
rich , uk of all the aircraft i have flown in , from gliders to large commercial jets , by far and away the best was my flight on concorde .
this is the only aircraft i have flown in where you can positively feel when it speeds up and slows down in the air .
the power felt amazing , plus the view from 58,000 feet and being able to see the darker skies above and the curvature of the earth .
all this whilst sipping champagne .
truly amazing .
i long for the days when i will be able to fly higher and faster .
the views and thrills as an astronaut must be amazing .

rich nasser , minneapolis , mn around five years ago , flying from the main maldives airport out to one of the island atolls in a tiny sea plane that sat around 6 passengers .
the pilot was from canada and to complement his neatly pressed shirt was sporting a cool pair of flip flops ! .
there was even an in flight magazine .
looking down from a few hundred feet -lrb- well it seemed like that -rrb- onto the indian ocean and all the atolls , then coming in to land by what seemed no more than a floating wooden strip about 20 foot square was definately unforgettable .
phil , nimes , france the most memorable thing for me was seeing concorde leave edinburgh airport for the last time ever .
people were openly crying all around me .
very sad .
how nice would it have been to have sent a concorde to the us yesterday to fly over kitty hawk and stamp its presence on history .
ba lets us down again !
gordon , falkirk uk flying low and fast over hartebeespoort dam , south africa , in a saaf puma helicopter ; and doing tactical night landings and take-offs whilst sitting on the cot behind the pilots in a c-160 transall .
my brother-in-law was flying the transall and it was both frightening and thrilling .
sadly he was killed last year test-flying an aerobatic aircraft .
graeme ballantyne , worksop , uk my first soloflight - incredible !
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark being the son of a former airforce- and later on business-pilot , i ´ ve spend countless hours in the cockpit on test flights etc. and , once in a while , on a few days trip around europe .
the most memorable flights i ´ ve had however , was when i joined the danish airforce .
my first soloflight - incredible !
i was flying the saab t-17 supporter , alone !
what a kick !
then came the first loop , roll , high-speed stall etc. etc . - all clear memories from my ' fly-boy-past ' .
i later failed a few tests , and had to leave the course .
oh you lucky guys up there ...
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark easily the most memorable flight of my life was when i visited the tiger moth club 's flying day at woburn abbey some years back as a guest of an old friend of my father 's .
not only did i meet night fighter ace john cunningham , one of my boyhood heroes , but i had a joyride in a tiger moth - complete with flying helmet inna biggles stylee !
guy chapman , reading , uk in october 1998 my girlfriend , now my wife , and i trekked up to everest base camp , starting from lukla at 9,500 ft .
our group of 16 flew from kathmandu to lukla in a light aircraft .
the flight through the snow-capped himalayas was magnificent and then we went into a very steep descent towards the side of a valley to land at lukla , an unmade , 500 metre airstrip on about a 40 degree slope on the side of a mountain !
as we hit the runway the noise of the twin props on reverse pitch and the stones bouncing off the underside of the aircraft were deafening .
the aircraft bounced and thundered up the slope of the runway and somehow managed to stop at the top to the relief of everyone .
it was the best ' white-knuckle ride ' ever !
david salmons , stevenage , hertfordshire i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight giles olley , winchester , uk i learned to fly this year .
my most memorable moment was september 11th 2003 when i flew solo for the first time .
i wo n't quickly forget the thrill of taking off on my own from southampton airport .
the feeling of elation as i successfully landed was incredible .
i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight .
giles olley , winchester , uk i will always remember the first time i went up in a glider .
i must have been about 7 or 8 and my dad took me up over the black mountains and i remember feeling as though i could fly .
emily , sandhurst , berkshire finally getting onto a flight home from the us after september 11th .
very mixed feelings .
getting struck by lightning when coming into land in germany and having to abort landing at the last moment .
flying from barbados to mystique in an 8-seater plane like a flying camper van , feeling completely safe and being able to see the fish in the water below .
kathy , marlborough , uk it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon charlie , oxford , uk i flew in a tiny cessna over miles and miles of the venezuelan jungle to see angel falls , the world 's highest waterfall .
it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon and see water cascading almost 1km to the base .
the falls were discovered by a pilot , jimmy angel - without planes we 'd probably still be unaware of their existence charlie , oxford , uk four years ago in my last weeks of university , my flatmate took us up in a light aircraft from filton , where concorde was partly built .
the views were absolutely incredible on that rare sunny day around bristol , and we wheeled over the river severn to look at a shipwreck .
we could even see a cricket match down below .
the sense of freedom is indescribable , and even in a small plane , the technical achievement of flight remains impressive .
julian , london , uk my most memorable flight was my first solo in a cessna 150 two-seater at age 48 .
i thought it was amazing to be piloting an aircraft all by myself !
bev , canada at the beginning of the 20th century , several countries competed keenly for the schneider trophy - eventually won outright by britain in 1931 with the s6b , a plane which was a forerunner of the spitfire .
this race was restored in the 1980s as part of the national air racing championships , organised by the royal aero club .
in 1991 , i had the honour and thrill of winning the diamond -lrb- 60 -rrb- jubilee schneider trophy air race in my condor aircraft - top speed 122mph !
brian manning , cleobury mortimer , worcs i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my first helicopter flight 13 years ago was the most memorable .
when the helicopter lifted straight up , the way the grass beneath made a radiating pattern from the downwash of the rotors , viewing trees in a forest from just a few feet directly above .
these are both images that i will never forget .
i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight .
russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my aviation memory is actually a memory of hearing my late father describe the 1st airborne division 's landing at arnhem .
many of the gliders crashed , either on takeoff or landing , or over the water on the journey .
he described it as ' sitting in a coffin ' , constantly shaken from side to side , buffeted by winds , feeling sick and frightened and ill .
out of his regiment , less than half made the journey home again .
i am amazed at the bravery of all the men who flew in these gliders .
it took my father some 40 years before he could bear to go near a plane after that .
and i am very proud of him .
kate , wales flying in a piston engine , douglas dc3 dakota from port said down to cairo after a month on an oil rig .
you climb into the plane at the rear and walk up the aisle - a fairly steep climb to your seat , then as the plane takes off the angle totally changes and the aisle becomes level .
that was in 1983 when the planes were getting on for 40 years old and still flying - i bet there are still dc3 dakotas flying commercially even now .
a wonderful plane .
anon , uk eating the smoked mackerel on a ba flight from dusseldorf to manchester , and then spending the rest of the flight with a sick bag and having to make a dash for the loo when we landed .
it seemed like the longest flight ever . !
lou , england when i was still flying to and from canada on a regular basis in the 1980s , i had the rare chance of sitting in the cockpit of a 747 flying to london heathrow .
because i knew a pilot in canada who worked for british airways , i was able to pass on greetings to the captain on this particular flight .
to my surprise , the stewardess who had taken the message said i was ' wanted in the cockpit ' .
it was ' night ' at the time , and , apart from the interesting explanation of most things in the cockpit , i noticed what to me was an amazing display of northern lights .
upon commenting , i was told that the crew , in over 20 years ' flying , had never seen them as they were on that night .
the entire sky was one great light show !
douglas fear , heidelberg , germany it 's easy to forget all the bravery , ideas , skill , and ingenuity people like the wrights and other pioneers who made it possible for those who wanted to fly des east , chelmsford , england when you think of all the millions of people who have ever lived on earth and who wanted to fly .

jo , bristol , uk my most memorable flight was flying to australia in 1996 - two things stick in my mind .
the first was flying over india at night , the blackness of the land was broken up by camp fires all over the landscape instead of the artificial light we see over westernised countries , and a huge moon hung in the sky , red from the heat of the day - i can still see the image in my head .

bev , canada at the beginning of the 20th century , several countries competed keenly for the schneider trophy - eventually won outright by britain in 1931 with the s6b , a plane which was a forerunner of the spitfire .
this race was restored in the 1980s as part of the national air racing championships , organised by the royal aero club .
in 1991 , i had the honour and thrill of winning the diamond -lrb- 60 -rrb- jubilee schneider trophy air race in my condor aircraft - top speed 122mph !
brian manning , cleobury mortimer , worcs i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my first helicopter flight 13 years ago was the most memorable .
when the helicopter lifted straight up , the way the grass beneath made a radiating pattern from the downwash of the rotors , viewing trees in a forest from just a few feet directly above .
these are both images that i will never forget .
i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight .
russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my aviation memory is actually a memory of hearing my late father describe the 1st airborne division 's landing at arnhem .
many of the gliders crashed , either on takeoff or landing , or over the water on the journey .
he described it as ' sitting in a coffin ' , constantly shaken from side to side , buffeted by winds , feeling sick and frightened and ill .
out of his regiment , less than half made the journey home again .
i am amazed at the bravery of all the men who flew in these gliders .
it took my father some 40 years before he could bear to go near a plane after that .
and i am very proud of him .
kate , wales flying in a piston engine , douglas dc3 dakota from port said down to cairo after a month on an oil rig .
you climb into the plane at the rear and walk up the aisle - a fairly steep climb to your seat , then as the plane takes off the angle totally changes and the aisle becomes level .
that was in 1983 when the planes were getting on for 40 years old and still flying - i bet there are still dc3 dakotas flying commercially even now .
a wonderful plane .
anon , uk eating the smoked mackerel on a ba flight from dusseldorf to manchester , and then spending the rest of the flight with a sick bag and having to make a dash for the loo when we landed .
it seemed like the longest flight ever . !
lou , england when i was still flying to and from canada on a regular basis in the 1980s , i had the rare chance of sitting in the cockpit of a 747 flying to london heathrow .
because i knew a pilot in canada who worked for british airways , i was able to pass on greetings to the captain on this particular flight .
to my surprise , the stewardess who had taken the message said i was ' wanted in the cockpit ' .
it was ' night ' at the time , and , apart from the interesting explanation of most things in the cockpit , i noticed what to me was an amazing display of northern lights .
upon commenting , i was told that the crew , in over 20 years ' flying , had never seen them as they were on that night .
the entire sky was one great light show !
douglas fear , heidelberg , germany it 's easy to forget all the bravery , ideas , skill , and ingenuity people like the wrights and other pioneers who made it possible for those who wanted to fly des east , chelmsford , england when you think of all the millions of people who have ever lived on earth and who wanted to fly .
even now i feel what a very rare privilege it is to be a pilot. and to know i can get into a machine make it leave the earth and come back safely .
flying on an airliner it 's easy to forget all the bravery , ideas , skill , and ingenuity people like the wrights and other pioneers who made it possible for those who wanted to fly the chance to do so .
des east , chelmsford , england when i flew back from mali a couple of years ago , i had malaria .
i was flying alone and feeling so miserable i started crying .
every one around me just stared , no one bothered to ask what was wrong which made me feel worse .
when we arrived my luggage was lost .
it took so long to sort it out that by the time i walked through the gates my sister thought i missed my plane and left so i had to make another 2 hours train ride to get home and i only had my summer clothes on me and this was half october ...
but i had a great time in mali that made it all worthwhile .
leen , belgium i was given a flying lesson in a cessna for my 21st birthday .
i was given total control of the plane from the moment we started taxiing up the runway , and the instructor only took it back as we were coming in to land -lrb- about 20ft off the ground ! -rrb-
the view of my local area from the sky , and the feeling of total exhilaration that i felt to be in control of such a gorgeous machine is one i will never forget .
i am now saving up so that i can do my full ppl some day !
jo , bristol , uk my most memorable flight was flying to australia in 1996 - two things stick in my mind .
the first was flying over india at night , the blackness of the land was broken up by camp fires all over the landscape instead of the artificial light we see over westernised countries , and a huge moon hung in the sky , red from the heat of the day - i can still see the image in my head .
the other memorable moment was flying over the top left hand corner of australia , just beautiful blue ocean , red , red earth and white sandy beaches which went on for miles and miles .
beautiful .
jeni middleton , leeds , uk two spring to mind .
1 .
concorde bay of biscay flight on my 21st birthday 14 yrs ago .
my dad fixed up for me to sit in the jump seat for the landing .
fantastic atmosphere for all on board especially when the old girl hit mach 2 .
when we landed at heathrow i had a smile that made my face hurt .
2 comet - xv814 , last ever flying comet 4b , round the coast of britain when i was apprentice at rae farnborough .
glad to say i flew in first and fastest jet airliners .
nic mccartney , fareham , england my grandma and granddad flying off on honeymoon to holland from liverpool airport in the early 1930s .
it was quite the event in their hometown of bolton and got them in the local paper with a picture of them standing by the plane on the runway , with a headline reading " bolton couple fly " .
the plane looked like it was made out of balsawood .
it was the one and only time in her long life that my grandma flew , despite all the things we told her about the advances they 'd made since those early days .
david walmsley , reading , uk thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk i have just started learning to fly this year and i must say it 's the most fantastic thing i have ever done .
already i have some memories to treasure .
flying over complete overcast in a surreal yet beautiful environment , or at 5000ft as the sun goes down is simply awesome and makes the whole thing worthwhile .
thank you wilbur and orville !
chris hodgson , manchester uk for me a flight coming home from the falkland islands to the uk and i was on the flight deck of the tristar as it crossed the equator and i watched as the dials showed the latitude and longitude readings .
the other must be watching a beautiful sunrise over the south pacific when flying to new zealand from honolulu .
the colours were breathtaking .
david hamilton , barkingside , essex uk when a student pilot , i took off at exeter with concorde on the apron , the red arrows getting ready to line up , and when i made contact with atc , they said to look out for a lancaster , a spitfire and a hurricane in the area .
definitely one to tell the grand-children paul , devon , uk i spent a lot of my childhood in seattle , usa as my father went to work for boeing , and his pet projects were the 747 and 747-400 .
when i was a small child , i would look up at the sky and call any plane in the sky a boeing .
most memorable flight i can remember was on a british airways 747 flight from seattle-tacoma to london heathrow , and i was allowed up in the cockpit .
we were flying over greenland at the time , and although it was the middle of the night , it was broad daylight .
kate , manchester , england i never really liked flying but am now just about used to it !
the last flight was from london to bangkok - a return journey of 24 hours but it was so smooth the seatbelt lights never went on once ... people go on about concorde but i think 747 's are also amazing and quite underrated .
safe flying everyone !
johnny , windsor , windsor , uk i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane paul , colchester , uk although my feet were firmly on terra-firma , my most vivid memory of flight was watching impromptu demonstration by a spitfire during a visit to duxford a few years back .
i can not think of a more perfect marriage of beauty and sheer brute power , despite its sixty years of age the spitfire 's spectacle was the most awesome sight in aviation that i 'd ever seen .
i was amazed by the grace , manoeuvrability and speed of the wwii vintage plane and the almost primeval howl of that rolls royce merlin engine as the pilot flung the machine through a series of tight turns and passes .
paul , colchester , uk i took my first flying lesson yesterday and the instructor let me take control of the aircraft from the moment we were in the air until the final landing approach .
45 minutes buzzing around the skies above my county at 3000 feet - what a rush !
rich , uk of all the aircraft i have flown in , from gliders to large commercial jets , by far and away the best was my flight on concorde .
this is the only aircraft i have flown in where you can positively feel when it speeds up and slows down in the air .
the power felt amazing , plus the view from 58,000 feet and being able to see the darker skies above and the curvature of the earth .
all this whilst sipping champagne .
truly amazing .
i long for the days when i will be able to fly higher and faster .
the views and thrills as an astronaut must be amazing .

your comments : i loved flying a cessna 172sp from san juan pr to christiansted , st. croix , or when i bought a ride in a stearman over napa valley ... but the most memorable was in a dc-3 approaching canaima in the venezuelan amazon and circling angel falls ...
rich nasser , minneapolis , mn around five years ago , flying from the main maldives airport out to one of the island atolls in a tiny sea plane that sat around 6 passengers .
the pilot was from canada and to complement his neatly pressed shirt was sporting a cool pair of flip flops ! .
there was even an in flight magazine .
looking down from a few hundred feet -lrb- well it seemed like that -rrb- onto the indian ocean and all the atolls , then coming in to land by what seemed no more than a floating wooden strip about 20 foot square was definately unforgettable .
phil , nimes , france the most memorable thing for me was seeing concorde leave edinburgh airport for the last time ever .
people were openly crying all around me .
very sad .
how nice would it have been to have sent a concorde to the us yesterday to fly over kitty hawk and stamp its presence on history .
ba lets us down again !
gordon , falkirk uk flying low and fast over hartebeespoort dam , south africa , in a saaf puma helicopter ; and doing tactical night landings and take-offs whilst sitting on the cot behind the pilots in a c-160 transall .
my brother-in-law was flying the transall and it was both frightening and thrilling .
sadly he was killed last year test-flying an aerobatic aircraft .
graeme ballantyne , worksop , uk my first soloflight - incredible !
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark being the son of a former airforce- and later on business-pilot , i ´ ve spend countless hours in the cockpit on test flights etc. and , once in a while , on a few days trip around europe .
the most memorable flights i ´ ve had however , was when i joined the danish airforce .
my first soloflight - incredible !
i was flying the saab t-17 supporter , alone !
what a kick !
then came the first loop , roll , high-speed stall etc. etc . - all clear memories from my ' fly-boy-past ' .
i later failed a few tests , and had to leave the course .
oh you lucky guys up there ...
asger , nykøbing f. , denmark easily the most memorable flight of my life was when i visited the tiger moth club 's flying day at woburn abbey some years back as a guest of an old friend of my father 's .
not only did i meet night fighter ace john cunningham , one of my boyhood heroes , but i had a joyride in a tiger moth - complete with flying helmet inna biggles stylee !
guy chapman , reading , uk in october 1998 my girlfriend , now my wife , and i trekked up to everest base camp , starting from lukla at 9,500 ft .
our group of 16 flew from kathmandu to lukla in a light aircraft .
the flight through the snow-capped himalayas was magnificent and then we went into a very steep descent towards the side of a valley to land at lukla , an unmade , 500 metre airstrip on about a 40 degree slope on the side of a mountain !
as we hit the runway the noise of the twin props on reverse pitch and the stones bouncing off the underside of the aircraft were deafening .
the aircraft bounced and thundered up the slope of the runway and somehow managed to stop at the top to the relief of everyone .
it was the best ' white-knuckle ride ' ever !
david salmons , stevenage , hertfordshire i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight giles olley , winchester , uk i learned to fly this year .
my most memorable moment was september 11th 2003 when i flew solo for the first time .
i wo n't quickly forget the thrill of taking off on my own from southampton airport .
the feeling of elation as i successfully landed was incredible .
i now have my licence and just took a flight over the south of england to celebrate the 100th anniversary of powered flight .
giles olley , winchester , uk i will always remember the first time i went up in a glider .
i must have been about 7 or 8 and my dad took me up over the black mountains and i remember feeling as though i could fly .
emily , sandhurst , berkshire finally getting onto a flight home from the us after september 11th .
very mixed feelings .
getting struck by lightning when coming into land in germany and having to abort landing at the last moment .
flying from barbados to mystique in an 8-seater plane like a flying camper van , feeling completely safe and being able to see the fish in the water below .
kathy , marlborough , uk it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon charlie , oxford , uk i flew in a tiny cessna over miles and miles of the venezuelan jungle to see angel falls , the world 's highest waterfall .
it was just incredible to fly into the green canyon and see water cascading almost 1km to the base .
the falls were discovered by a pilot , jimmy angel - without planes we 'd probably still be unaware of their existence charlie , oxford , uk four years ago in my last weeks of university , my flatmate took us up in a light aircraft from filton , where concorde was partly built .
the views were absolutely incredible on that rare sunny day around bristol , and we wheeled over the river severn to look at a shipwreck .
we could even see a cricket match down below .
the sense of freedom is indescribable , and even in a small plane , the technical achievement of flight remains impressive .
julian , london , uk my most memorable flight was my first solo in a cessna 150 two-seater at age 48 .
i thought it was amazing to be piloting an aircraft all by myself !

brian manning , cleobury mortimer , worcs i wonder what observations and comments the wright brothers would have made of helicopter flight russell aisbitt , lower slaughter , uk my first helicopter flight 13 years ago was the most memorable .
