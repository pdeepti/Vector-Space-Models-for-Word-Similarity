the chancellor is now turning his focus to his own solutions . faced with a job-killing economy , chancellor gerhard schröder decided it was time to call together the country 's business and union leaders on monday evening for talks without taboos .
but when the meeting was over , schröder saw that his talks without taboos were nothing more than discussions without a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " it became clear that the basic positions of the employers ' groups on the one hand and the unions on the other ... were too far apart , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a television interview late monday .
as a result of these colliding interests , the chancellor said he would take it upon himself to point the way for the two groups when he makes a major economic address on march 14 to the country 's parliament .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said .
alliance for jobs created the chancellor made the comments after he failed to revive a round of talks he called " alliance for jobs " .
the alliance was created in december 1998 , roughly two months after schröder took office , as a forum where leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government could seek consensus solutions to the country 's employment problems .
but the push for consensus created conflict as the unions and the employers fought over such things as apprenticeships , overtime hours and layoff rules .
these conflicts became public once again after monday evening 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations dieter hundt , who leads the confederation of german employers ' associations , said the time for talking was over .
" getting out of this misery will require more than a focus on trivial little details , " hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a radio interview on tuesday morning .
but the unions continued to express their skepticism about the employers ' true aims .
hilmar höhn of the german trade union federation said the employers ' goal was to advance a " widespread program designed to dismantle social policies . "
economy continues to slide the breakdown of the talks took place against a backdrop of ever-worsening economic news .
more than 34,500 german companies filed for bankruptcy between january and november 2002 , and the federal statistics office estimates that the total number of business failures for the year could rise to 38,000 , an increase of 18 percent from 32,200 the previous year .
the number of jobless germans surged to 4.6 million , or 11.1 percent , in january .
the economy nearly fell into recession in 2002 with an estimated growth rate of 0.2 percent .
it was the economy 's worst performance since 1993 .
the prospects are not much better this year with the government expecting a growth rate of 1 percent .
the end of the alliance of jobs began to take shape early last month , when hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
in addressing one of the unions ' major concerns , he suggested that employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
such a suggestion would reverse a drop in such positions .
through september , for instance , the number of apprenticeships fell by 7.1 percent to 570,600 .
in return , hundt asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
but michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , rejected the program outright .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
minister to hold talks following monday evening 's meeting , schröder said his labor and economics minister , wolfgang clement , would continue to hold separate talks with the unions and employers ' groups about various issues in the hopes of finding a common ground .
if sufficient progress is made , schröder said he would be willing to meet with the groups once again .
but the chancellor said his main focus would be on the economic challenges presented by such subjects as globalization , and on the " fair and just solutions " he would offer in the march 14 address .
" and the groups can then form their own opinion on them , good and bad , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german employers and unions clashing anew germany 's employers are offering a plan that they say will help create desperately needed jobs .
but the country 's unions react with a wave of protest that may sink a key element of the government 's employment push . -lrb- feb .

the chancellor is now turning his focus to his own solutions . faced with a job-killing economy , chancellor gerhard schröder decided it was time to call together the country 's business and union leaders on monday evening for talks without taboos .
but when the meeting was over , schröder saw that his talks without taboos were nothing more than discussions without a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " it became clear that the basic positions of the employers ' groups on the one hand and the unions on the other ... were too far apart , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a television interview late monday .
as a result of these colliding interests , the chancellor said he would take it upon himself to point the way for the two groups when he makes a major economic address on march 14 to the country 's parliament .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said .
alliance for jobs created the chancellor made the comments after he failed to revive a round of talks he called " alliance for jobs " .
the alliance was created in december 1998 , roughly two months after schröder took office , as a forum where leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government could seek consensus solutions to the country 's employment problems .
but the push for consensus created conflict as the unions and the employers fought over such things as apprenticeships , overtime hours and layoff rules .
these conflicts became public once again after monday evening 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations dieter hundt , who leads the confederation of german employers ' associations , said the time for talking was over .
" getting out of this misery will require more than a focus on trivial little details , " hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a radio interview on tuesday morning .
but the unions continued to express their skepticism about the employers ' true aims .
hilmar höhn of the german trade union federation said the employers ' goal was to advance a " widespread program designed to dismantle social policies . "
economy continues to slide the breakdown of the talks took place against a backdrop of ever-worsening economic news .
more than 34,500 german companies filed for bankruptcy between january and november 2002 , and the federal statistics office estimates that the total number of business failures for the year could rise to 38,000 , an increase of 18 percent from 32,200 the previous year .
the number of jobless germans surged to 4.6 million , or 11.1 percent , in january .
the economy nearly fell into recession in 2002 with an estimated growth rate of 0.2 percent .
it was the economy 's worst performance since 1993 .
the prospects are not much better this year with the government expecting a growth rate of 1 percent .
the end of the alliance of jobs began to take shape early last month , when hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
in addressing one of the unions ' major concerns , he suggested that employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
such a suggestion would reverse a drop in such positions .
through september , for instance , the number of apprenticeships fell by 7.1 percent to 570,600 .

as a result of these colliding interests , the chancellor said he would take it upon himself to point the way for the two groups when he makes a major economic address on march 14 to the country 's parliament .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said .
alliance for jobs created the chancellor made the comments after he failed to revive a round of talks he called " alliance for jobs " .
the alliance was created in december 1998 , roughly two months after schröder took office , as a forum where leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government could seek consensus solutions to the country 's employment problems .
but the push for consensus created conflict as the unions and the employers fought over such things as apprenticeships , overtime hours and layoff rules .
these conflicts became public once again after monday evening 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations dieter hundt , who leads the confederation of german employers ' associations , said the time for talking was over .
" getting out of this misery will require more than a focus on trivial little details , " hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a radio interview on tuesday morning .
but the unions continued to express their skepticism about the employers ' true aims .
hilmar höhn of the german trade union federation said the employers ' goal was to advance a " widespread program designed to dismantle social policies . "
economy continues to slide the breakdown of the talks took place against a backdrop of ever-worsening economic news .
more than 34,500 german companies filed for bankruptcy between january and november 2002 , and the federal statistics office estimates that the total number of business failures for the year could rise to 38,000 , an increase of 18 percent from 32,200 the previous year .
the number of jobless germans surged to 4.6 million , or 11.1 percent , in january .
the economy nearly fell into recession in 2002 with an estimated growth rate of 0.2 percent .
it was the economy 's worst performance since 1993 .
the prospects are not much better this year with the government expecting a growth rate of 1 percent .
the end of the alliance of jobs began to take shape early last month , when hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
in addressing one of the unions ' major concerns , he suggested that employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
such a suggestion would reverse a drop in such positions .
through september , for instance , the number of apprenticeships fell by 7.1 percent to 570,600 .
in return , hundt asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
but michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , rejected the program outright .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
minister to hold talks following monday evening 's meeting , schröder said his labor and economics minister , wolfgang clement , would continue to hold separate talks with the unions and employers ' groups about various issues in the hopes of finding a common ground .
if sufficient progress is made , schröder said he would be willing to meet with the groups once again .
but the chancellor said his main focus would be on the economic challenges presented by such subjects as globalization , and on the " fair and just solutions " he would offer in the march 14 address .

the chancellor is now turning his focus to his own solutions . faced with a job-killing economy , chancellor gerhard schröder decided it was time to call together the country 's business and union leaders on monday evening for talks without taboos .
but when the meeting was over , schröder saw that his talks without taboos were nothing more than discussions without a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " it became clear that the basic positions of the employers ' groups on the one hand and the unions on the other ... were too far apart , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a television interview late monday .
as a result of these colliding interests , the chancellor said he would take it upon himself to point the way for the two groups when he makes a major economic address on march 14 to the country 's parliament .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said .
alliance for jobs created the chancellor made the comments after he failed to revive a round of talks he called " alliance for jobs " .
the alliance was created in december 1998 , roughly two months after schröder took office , as a forum where leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government could seek consensus solutions to the country 's employment problems .
but the push for consensus created conflict as the unions and the employers fought over such things as apprenticeships , overtime hours and layoff rules .
these conflicts became public once again after monday evening 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations dieter hundt , who leads the confederation of german employers ' associations , said the time for talking was over .
" getting out of this misery will require more than a focus on trivial little details , " hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a radio interview on tuesday morning .
but the unions continued to express their skepticism about the employers ' true aims .
hilmar höhn of the german trade union federation said the employers ' goal was to advance a " widespread program designed to dismantle social policies . "
economy continues to slide the breakdown of the talks took place against a backdrop of ever-worsening economic news .
more than 34,500 german companies filed for bankruptcy between january and november 2002 , and the federal statistics office estimates that the total number of business failures for the year could rise to 38,000 , an increase of 18 percent from 32,200 the previous year .
the number of jobless germans surged to 4.6 million , or 11.1 percent , in january .
the economy nearly fell into recession in 2002 with an estimated growth rate of 0.2 percent .
it was the economy 's worst performance since 1993 .
the prospects are not much better this year with the government expecting a growth rate of 1 percent .
the end of the alliance of jobs began to take shape early last month , when hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
in addressing one of the unions ' major concerns , he suggested that employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
such a suggestion would reverse a drop in such positions .
through september , for instance , the number of apprenticeships fell by 7.1 percent to 570,600 .
in return , hundt asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
but michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , rejected the program outright .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
minister to hold talks following monday evening 's meeting , schröder said his labor and economics minister , wolfgang clement , would continue to hold separate talks with the unions and employers ' groups about various issues in the hopes of finding a common ground .
if sufficient progress is made , schröder said he would be willing to meet with the groups once again .
but the chancellor said his main focus would be on the economic challenges presented by such subjects as globalization , and on the " fair and just solutions " he would offer in the march 14 address .

hilmar höhn of the german trade union federation said the employers ' goal was to advance a " widespread program designed to dismantle social policies . "
economy continues to slide the breakdown of the talks took place against a backdrop of ever-worsening economic news .
more than 34,500 german companies filed for bankruptcy between january and november 2002 , and the federal statistics office estimates that the total number of business failures for the year could rise to 38,000 , an increase of 18 percent from 32,200 the previous year .
the number of jobless germans surged to 4.6 million , or 11.1 percent , in january .
the economy nearly fell into recession in 2002 with an estimated growth rate of 0.2 percent .
it was the economy 's worst performance since 1993 .
the prospects are not much better this year with the government expecting a growth rate of 1 percent .
the end of the alliance of jobs began to take shape early last month , when hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
in addressing one of the unions ' major concerns , he suggested that employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
such a suggestion would reverse a drop in such positions .
through september , for instance , the number of apprenticeships fell by 7.1 percent to 570,600 .
in return , hundt asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
but michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , rejected the program outright .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
minister to hold talks following monday evening 's meeting , schröder said his labor and economics minister , wolfgang clement , would continue to hold separate talks with the unions and employers ' groups about various issues in the hopes of finding a common ground .
if sufficient progress is made , schröder said he would be willing to meet with the groups once again .
but the chancellor said his main focus would be on the economic challenges presented by such subjects as globalization , and on the " fair and just solutions " he would offer in the march 14 address .

the chancellor is now turning his focus to his own solutions . faced with a job-killing economy , chancellor gerhard schröder decided it was time to call together the country 's business and union leaders on monday evening for talks without taboos .
but when the meeting was over , schröder saw that his talks without taboos were nothing more than discussions without a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " it became clear that the basic positions of the employers ' groups on the one hand and the unions on the other ... were too far apart , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a television interview late monday .
as a result of these colliding interests , the chancellor said he would take it upon himself to point the way for the two groups when he makes a major economic address on march 14 to the country 's parliament .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said .
alliance for jobs created the chancellor made the comments after he failed to revive a round of talks he called " alliance for jobs " .
the alliance was created in december 1998 , roughly two months after schröder took office , as a forum where leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government could seek consensus solutions to the country 's employment problems .
but the push for consensus created conflict as the unions and the employers fought over such things as apprenticeships , overtime hours and layoff rules .

the minister said that the government would give the go-ahead for the new regulations in the cabinet in may , so that agricultural products such as maize and seeds that have been genetically engineered could once again be imported into germany after a freeze lasting several years .
with the decision , the government has given in to long-standing demands of industry and business to open up the markets for green biotechnology .
according to biocom ag , a publishing company specialising in the life sciences sector , there are some 600 biotech companies in germany , heavily involved in biotechnological research .
eu regulations still fuzzy künast made it clear that the new german law would only be implemented once eu regulations on the import and labeling of gm foods came into effect .
künast indicated that the german government would then support the lifting of the eu-wide ban on the import of gm plants that has been in place since june 1999 - a move that the european commission has been urging member states for months to take .
before that can happen , the european parliament first has to approve of tough gmo -lrb- genetically modified organisms -rrb- labeling laws in food and animal feed passed by eu agricultural ministers last november .
but the new eu legislation has still not cleared up the confusion about how exactly foods that include genetically modified organisms should be handled .
the regulations would force the labeling of foods that are derived from gm crops but do not contain any measurable gm protein or dna .
this would include glucose syrup produced from gm maize or soybean and rape oil from gm plants .
the proposed laws would allow some food that contains detectable gm ingredients to go unlabelled .
any food with less than 0.9 percent of detectable gm components would not require a gm label .
another new feature of the proposed law is that animal feed produced from gm crops would also require labeling .
so too will animal feed containing gm-derived ingredients such as flavorings or vitamin additives .
the new regulations also lay down that production and processing of the products must be transparent and documented comprehensively .
minister künast also wants tough german regulations in place for a worst-case scenario such as genetically modified seeds spreading uncontrollably .
" thanks to labeling , the consumers can in future choose between buying gm food or not , " she said .
" no obvious advantages " : critic but not everybody is happy with künast ’ s decision .
mr. wolfschmidt of foodwatch , a watchdog organization in germany that stresses food safety to protect consumers , told dw-world he sees no reason for the german government to make such an announcement now .
" from the point of view of the consumer , it brings absolutely no kind of advantage for anyone at present , " he said .
künast said that even today gm products were used in certain production processes , without the knowledge of the consumers .
" that would come to an end in the future , " she said .
wolfschmidt says that the minister ’ s statement gives a wrong signal .
" she ’ s legitimizing what we don ’ t know for sure to be true , " he said .
he said that there are such a variety of components involved in products such as biscuits and other baked products that it was difficult to prove whether some contained traces of gm food .
wolfschmidt also said that the new law would only flood the german market with surplus products that weren ’ t really needed .
" the biotechnology lobby only wants to pursue its interests and hopes that the consumers will eventually give up their resistance to gm products , " he said .
economic argument beginning to weigh with the germans indeed ordinary germans , with their famed eco-consciousness , worries about the ethical implications of genetically engineered organisms , and strict regulations governing genetic research , have been among the most resistant to new genetic technology .
however that may be changing as germany ’ s politicians are waking up to the enormous economic potential of biotechnology .
in 1997 , german politicians backed the biotechnology patent law approved by the european parliament .
on sunday , künast too emphasized that genetically modified products had become a " world-wide reality " .
she said that globally genetically engineered plants were being planted on some 60 million hectares of land , with the u.s. alone accounting for more than half of that amount .
" in the face of such facts , we are not going to have a yes-no debate , " she added .
the german government , she said , was for freedom of choice and for coexistence between conventional , ecological and genetically modified plants .
the european commission has repeated in the past that the eu member states are in danger of losing out in the international biotechnology race with their resistance to gm products .
besides , the u.s. , countries such as china , india and argentina are seen as edging past several european countries to pick up a bigger slice of a globally growing industry .
transatlantic trade spat spurs germans to act ?
wolfschmidt of foodwatch suspects that the reason the government suddenly seems to be rushing its decision on gm production is to lay to rest the " transatlantic spat " over gm food .
indeed the u.s. and the eu are locked in a trade battle over gm food for the past four years ever since the eu banned imports of gm foods .
last month , in the strongest indication that things might be coming to a head , the bush administration ’ s top trade official , robert zoellick threatened to file a case against the eu at the wto and said he had lost his patience with the four-year feud about the safety of american biotechnology food .
he called the european position , " immoral " for leading to starvation in the developing world .
the european union for its part released a statement that it had approved 18 genetically modified products and that while it was " aware of u.s. frustration " , officials warned against any action at the wto . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new rules for genetically modified foods but the new eu legislation has still not cleared up the confusion about how exactly foods that include genetically modified organisms should be handled .

the chancellor is now turning his focus to his own solutions . faced with a job-killing economy , chancellor gerhard schröder decided it was time to call together the country 's business and union leaders on monday evening for talks without taboos .
but when the meeting was over , schröder saw that his talks without taboos were nothing more than discussions without a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " it became clear that the basic positions of the employers ' groups on the one hand and the unions on the other ... were too far apart , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a television interview late monday .
as a result of these colliding interests , the chancellor said he would take it upon himself to point the way for the two groups when he makes a major economic address on march 14 to the country 's parliament .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said .
alliance for jobs created the chancellor made the comments after he failed to revive a round of talks he called " alliance for jobs " .
the alliance was created in december 1998 , roughly two months after schröder took office , as a forum where leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government could seek consensus solutions to the country 's employment problems .
but the push for consensus created conflict as the unions and the employers fought over such things as apprenticeships , overtime hours and layoff rules .
these conflicts became public once again after monday evening 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations dieter hundt , who leads the confederation of german employers ' associations , said the time for talking was over .
" getting out of this misery will require more than a focus on trivial little details , " hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a radio interview on tuesday morning .
but the unions continued to express their skepticism about the employers ' true aims .
hilmar höhn of the german trade union federation said the employers ' goal was to advance a " widespread program designed to dismantle social policies . "
economy continues to slide the breakdown of the talks took place against a backdrop of ever-worsening economic news .
more than 34,500 german companies filed for bankruptcy between january and november 2002 , and the federal statistics office estimates that the total number of business failures for the year could rise to 38,000 , an increase of 18 percent from 32,200 the previous year .
the number of jobless germans surged to 4.6 million , or 11.1 percent , in january .
the economy nearly fell into recession in 2002 with an estimated growth rate of 0.2 percent .
it was the economy 's worst performance since 1993 .
the prospects are not much better this year with the government expecting a growth rate of 1 percent .
the end of the alliance of jobs began to take shape early last month , when hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
in addressing one of the unions ' major concerns , he suggested that employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
such a suggestion would reverse a drop in such positions .
through september , for instance , the number of apprenticeships fell by 7.1 percent to 570,600 .
in return , hundt asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
but michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , rejected the program outright .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
minister to hold talks following monday evening 's meeting , schröder said his labor and economics minister , wolfgang clement , would continue to hold separate talks with the unions and employers ' groups about various issues in the hopes of finding a common ground .
if sufficient progress is made , schröder said he would be willing to meet with the groups once again .
but the chancellor said his main focus would be on the economic challenges presented by such subjects as globalization , and on the " fair and just solutions " he would offer in the march 14 address .

but the push for consensus created conflict as the unions and the employers fought over such things as apprenticeships , overtime hours and layoff rules .
these conflicts became public once again after monday evening 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations dieter hundt , who leads the confederation of german employers ' associations , said the time for talking was over .
" getting out of this misery will require more than a focus on trivial little details , " hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a radio interview on tuesday morning .
but the unions continued to express their skepticism about the employers ' true aims .
hilmar höhn of the german trade union federation said the employers ' goal was to advance a " widespread program designed to dismantle social policies . "
economy continues to slide the breakdown of the talks took place against a backdrop of ever-worsening economic news .
more than 34,500 german companies filed for bankruptcy between january and november 2002 , and the federal statistics office estimates that the total number of business failures for the year could rise to 38,000 , an increase of 18 percent from 32,200 the previous year .
the number of jobless germans surged to 4.6 million , or 11.1 percent , in january .
the economy nearly fell into recession in 2002 with an estimated growth rate of 0.2 percent .
it was the economy 's worst performance since 1993 .
the prospects are not much better this year with the government expecting a growth rate of 1 percent .
the end of the alliance of jobs began to take shape early last month , when hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
in addressing one of the unions ' major concerns , he suggested that employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
such a suggestion would reverse a drop in such positions .
through september , for instance , the number of apprenticeships fell by 7.1 percent to 570,600 .
in return , hundt asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
but michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , rejected the program outright .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
minister to hold talks following monday evening 's meeting , schröder said his labor and economics minister , wolfgang clement , would continue to hold separate talks with the unions and employers ' groups about various issues in the hopes of finding a common ground .
if sufficient progress is made , schröder said he would be willing to meet with the groups once again .

the minister said that the government would give the go-ahead for the new regulations in the cabinet in may , so that agricultural products such as maize and seeds that have been genetically engineered could once again be imported into germany after a freeze lasting several years .
with the decision , the government has given in to long-standing demands of industry and business to open up the markets for green biotechnology .
according to biocom ag , a publishing company specialising in the life sciences sector , there are some 600 biotech companies in germany , heavily involved in biotechnological research .
eu regulations still fuzzy künast made it clear that the new german law would only be implemented once eu regulations on the import and labeling of gm foods came into effect .
künast indicated that the german government would then support the lifting of the eu-wide ban on the import of gm plants that has been in place since june 1999 - a move that the european commission has been urging member states for months to take .
before that can happen , the european parliament first has to approve of tough gmo -lrb- genetically modified organisms -rrb- labeling laws in food and animal feed passed by eu agricultural ministers last november .
but the new eu legislation has still not cleared up the confusion about how exactly foods that include genetically modified organisms should be handled .
the regulations would force the labeling of foods that are derived from gm crops but do not contain any measurable gm protein or dna .
this would include glucose syrup produced from gm maize or soybean and rape oil from gm plants .
the proposed laws would allow some food that contains detectable gm ingredients to go unlabelled .
any food with less than 0.9 percent of detectable gm components would not require a gm label .
another new feature of the proposed law is that animal feed produced from gm crops would also require labeling .
so too will animal feed containing gm-derived ingredients such as flavorings or vitamin additives .
the new regulations also lay down that production and processing of the products must be transparent and documented comprehensively .
minister künast also wants tough german regulations in place for a worst-case scenario such as genetically modified seeds spreading uncontrollably .
" thanks to labeling , the consumers can in future choose between buying gm food or not , " she said .
" no obvious advantages " : critic but not everybody is happy with künast ’ s decision .
mr. wolfschmidt of foodwatch , a watchdog organization in germany that stresses food safety to protect consumers , told dw-world he sees no reason for the german government to make such an announcement now .
" from the point of view of the consumer , it brings absolutely no kind of advantage for anyone at present , " he said .
künast said that even today gm products were used in certain production processes , without the knowledge of the consumers .
" that would come to an end in the future , " she said .
wolfschmidt says that the minister ’ s statement gives a wrong signal .
" she ’ s legitimizing what we don ’ t know for sure to be true , " he said .
he said that there are such a variety of components involved in products such as biscuits and other baked products that it was difficult to prove whether some contained traces of gm food .
wolfschmidt also said that the new law would only flood the german market with surplus products that weren ’ t really needed .
" the biotechnology lobby only wants to pursue its interests and hopes that the consumers will eventually give up their resistance to gm products , " he said .
economic argument beginning to weigh with the germans indeed ordinary germans , with their famed eco-consciousness , worries about the ethical implications of genetically engineered organisms , and strict regulations governing genetic research , have been among the most resistant to new genetic technology .
however that may be changing as germany ’ s politicians are waking up to the enormous economic potential of biotechnology .
in 1997 , german politicians backed the biotechnology patent law approved by the european parliament .
on sunday , künast too emphasized that genetically modified products had become a " world-wide reality " .
she said that globally genetically engineered plants were being planted on some 60 million hectares of land , with the u.s. alone accounting for more than half of that amount .
" in the face of such facts , we are not going to have a yes-no debate , " she added .
the german government , she said , was for freedom of choice and for coexistence between conventional , ecological and genetically modified plants .
the european commission has repeated in the past that the eu member states are in danger of losing out in the international biotechnology race with their resistance to gm products .
besides , the u.s. , countries such as china , india and argentina are seen as edging past several european countries to pick up a bigger slice of a globally growing industry .
transatlantic trade spat spurs germans to act ?
wolfschmidt of foodwatch suspects that the reason the government suddenly seems to be rushing its decision on gm production is to lay to rest the " transatlantic spat " over gm food .
indeed the u.s. and the eu are locked in a trade battle over gm food for the past four years ever since the eu banned imports of gm foods .
last month , in the strongest indication that things might be coming to a head , the bush administration ’ s top trade official , robert zoellick threatened to file a case against the eu at the wto and said he had lost his patience with the four-year feud about the safety of american biotechnology food .
he called the european position , " immoral " for leading to starvation in the developing world .
the european union for its part released a statement that it had approved 18 genetically modified products and that while it was " aware of u.s. frustration " , officials warned against any action at the wto . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new rules for genetically modified foods but the new eu legislation has still not cleared up the confusion about how exactly foods that include genetically modified organisms should be handled .

the chancellor is now turning his focus to his own solutions . faced with a job-killing economy , chancellor gerhard schröder decided it was time to call together the country 's business and union leaders on monday evening for talks without taboos .
but when the meeting was over , schröder saw that his talks without taboos were nothing more than discussions without a future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder " it became clear that the basic positions of the employers ' groups on the one hand and the unions on the other ... were too far apart , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a television interview late monday .
as a result of these colliding interests , the chancellor said he would take it upon himself to point the way for the two groups when he makes a major economic address on march 14 to the country 's parliament .
" we do n't have any time to waste , " schröder said .
alliance for jobs created the chancellor made the comments after he failed to revive a round of talks he called " alliance for jobs " .
the alliance was created in december 1998 , roughly two months after schröder took office , as a forum where leading members of germany 's business community , labor unions and government could seek consensus solutions to the country 's employment problems .
but the push for consensus created conflict as the unions and the employers fought over such things as apprenticeships , overtime hours and layoff rules .
these conflicts became public once again after monday evening 's meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ' associations dieter hundt , who leads the confederation of german employers ' associations , said the time for talking was over .
" getting out of this misery will require more than a focus on trivial little details , " hundt -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a radio interview on tuesday morning .
but the unions continued to express their skepticism about the employers ' true aims .
hilmar höhn of the german trade union federation said the employers ' goal was to advance a " widespread program designed to dismantle social policies . "
economy continues to slide the breakdown of the talks took place against a backdrop of ever-worsening economic news .
more than 34,500 german companies filed for bankruptcy between january and november 2002 , and the federal statistics office estimates that the total number of business failures for the year could rise to 38,000 , an increase of 18 percent from 32,200 the previous year .
the number of jobless germans surged to 4.6 million , or 11.1 percent , in january .
the economy nearly fell into recession in 2002 with an estimated growth rate of 0.2 percent .
it was the economy 's worst performance since 1993 .
the prospects are not much better this year with the government expecting a growth rate of 1 percent .
the end of the alliance of jobs began to take shape early last month , when hundt presented a six-point plan designed to promote " a consensus between the government , unions and employers that would get us out of our crisis in growth . "
in the plan , hundt suggested that the employers and union make a deal .
in addressing one of the unions ' major concerns , he suggested that employers would guarantee a training position to every qualified young person .
such a suggestion would reverse a drop in such positions .
through september , for instance , the number of apprenticeships fell by 7.1 percent to 570,600 .
in return , hundt asked the unions to accept looser rules on one of their most cherished benefits - protection against layoffs .
hundt proposed that the rules would apply to companies with more than 20 employers and take effect once a worker had been with a company for three years .
currently , those rules apply to companies with more than five workers .
but michael sommer , the leader of the german trade union federation , rejected the program outright .
" we will not allow these protections to be trampled on , " sommer said .
" there is not one credible study that shows such changes would create jobs . "
minister to hold talks following monday evening 's meeting , schröder said his labor and economics minister , wolfgang clement , would continue to hold separate talks with the unions and employers ' groups about various issues in the hopes of finding a common ground .
if sufficient progress is made , schröder said he would be willing to meet with the groups once again .

researchers at tel aviv university in israel are urging parents not to give in too often to their child 's demands for a later bedtime .
they looked at the sleeping habits of 77 children aged between nine and 11 , monitoring both the time they went to bed and the number of times they woke up in the night .
they then asked the children to either spend an extra hour asleep for a few nights , or to give up an hour 's sleep .
the results , published in were clear-cut - children who got an hour less were significantly more fatigued during the evenings and performed less well at various tests of mental sharpness , which measured reaction times and memory .
dr avi sadeh , who led the study , said : " previous studies have suggested that children today are getting less and less sleep over the years . "
i would not allow a child to have a television or computer in their bedroom " professor jim horne , loughborough sleep research centre " parents and childcare professionals can explore the appropriate sleep needs of a specific child by experimenting with extending or restricting sleep , tracking the changes in the child 's behaviour and well-being , and finding the child 's optimal sleep needs . "
a separate study published in the journal pediatrics suggested a link between a common sleep disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -lrb- adhd -rrb- in children .
irritable dr david gozal of the university of louisville looked at five to seven year olds diagnosed with mild adhd symptoms and found that a quarter of them snored - more than might be expected in a non-adhd group .
this , said gozal , raised the suggestion that mild sleep apnoea - characterised by breathing difficulties during sleep - might be harming the quality of the children 's sleep .
this might be producing symptoms of attention deficit and mild hyperactivity in some of them .
professor jim horne , of the sleep research centre at loughborough university , told bbc news online that younger children deprived of sleep tended not to show obvious signs of fatigue , but became hyperactive and irritable .
he said that modern child lifestyles were increasing the risk of sleep deprivation .
he said : " bedrooms are changing from places of rest and tranquility to places where there are lots of things to keep a child awake , such as computers and televisions .
" i would not allow a child to have a television or computer in their bedroom - or at least place firm limits on their use . "

professor jim horne , of the sleep research centre at loughborough university , told bbc news online that younger children deprived of sleep tended not to show obvious signs of fatigue , but became hyperactive and irritable .
he said that modern child lifestyles were increasing the risk of sleep deprivation .
he said : " bedrooms are changing from places of rest and tranquility to places where there are lots of things to keep a child awake , such as computers and televisions .
" i would not allow a child to have a television or computer in their bedroom - or at least place firm limits on their use . "

researchers at tel aviv university in israel are urging parents not to give in too often to their child 's demands for a later bedtime .
they looked at the sleeping habits of 77 children aged between nine and 11 , monitoring both the time they went to bed and the number of times they woke up in the night .
they then asked the children to either spend an extra hour asleep for a few nights , or to give up an hour 's sleep .
the results , published in were clear-cut - children who got an hour less were significantly more fatigued during the evenings and performed less well at various tests of mental sharpness , which measured reaction times and memory .
dr avi sadeh , who led the study , said : " previous studies have suggested that children today are getting less and less sleep over the years .
i would not allow a child to have a television or computer in their bedroom professor jim horne , loughborough sleep research centre " parents and childcare professionals can explore the appropriate sleep needs of a specific child by experimenting with extending or restricting sleep , tracking the changes in the child 's behaviour and well-being , and finding the child 's optimal sleep needs . "
a separate study published in the journal pediatrics suggested a link between a common sleep disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -lrb- adhd -rrb- in children .
irritable dr david gozal of the university of louisville looked at five to seven year olds diagnosed with mild adhd symptoms and found that a quarter of them snored - more than might be expected in a non-adhd group .
this , said gozal , raised the suggestion that mild sleep apnoea - characterised by breathing difficulties during sleep - might be harming the quality of the children 's sleep .
this might be producing symptoms of attention deficit and mild hyperactivity in some of them .

0600 nairobi prison is a maze of chain-link fences , razor wire and guard towers in the city 's busy industrial area .
there are 12 inmates here in this cell meant for only three people prison official david mwania inside , the first roll-call , to ensure all inmates are accounted for , is under way .
in quick succession , iron doors open to reveal hundreds of half naked bodies , pressed together on the concrete floor of their cells .
their cages are filled with the fetid smell of sweat , dirt and human waste .
evidence that the prison is being choked with inmates , some on short sentences and others waiting to appear in court , is not exactly hard to find .
here more than 3,000 inmates - 3,800 on today 's count - share a prison designed for only 800 prisoners .
the daily budget : $ 0.30 per prisoner .
" this is the worst congested prison in the country , " says david mwania , who is in charge of nairobi prison , built in 1911 .
in the capital wing , housing more than 400 inmates facing the capital punishment , dozens of inmates are herded into tiny cells with the capacity for between one and five prisoners .
kenyan prisons are notoriously overcrowded " there are 12 inmates here in this cell meant for only three people , " mr mwania says , pointing to an old , stinking cell .
" there are only two mattresses and no blankets . "
one of the inmates is 30-year-old john njoroge njagi , who has been here for four years , facing a charge of robbery with violence , a capital offence .
" i have n't put on my clothes because we 've been sweating throughout the night , " he says .
" four years on , my case is still pending in court and i am still here . " 0700 it is breakfast time - a mixture of boiled water and maize flour with no sugar is served in the open air grounds of the prison .
thousands of inmates in tattered prison uniforms , and some in civilian clothes , emerge from their cells .
i do n't think any human being can survive here .
nigerian prisoner colin alexander this is the frontline of the prison overcrowding crisis in kenya .
you can sense the tension here .
" as you can see , some of them have no prison uniform - this is another problem here , " says david mwania .
" we do n't have enough uniform for all prisoners . "
in one prison ward , 250 squatting inmates serving short sentences , are crammed into one room meant for only 50 prisoners sharing only five mattresses .
the prison is also home for nationals of other countries .
colin alexander from nigeria has been here for eight months , surviving on half-cooked ugali , kenyans ' staple food , awaiting trial : " this is the worst prison i have ever seen .
everything about this place is bad , including the treatment from the wardens .
" we are surviving by the grace of god - i do n't think any human being can survive here . "
and men of god are also doing time here - people like bishop makhokha of a home-grown church , who claims he was arrested during the december election campaign after his congregation stoned former president daniel arap moi 's motorcade in kakamega , western kenya .
" i spend my time here preaching and spreading the word of god , " he says .
but not many have found consolation in religion .
fifty-two-year-old thuo thiong 'o - popularly known as tt - has been here for four years facing a charge of murder .
he says sodomy , a criminal offence in kenya , is common in the prison : many are waiting for a trial date " because of congestion , people here sleep pressed body to body and this body contact leads to these kind of tendencies . "
but the nairobi jail , like many other facets of kenyan life , is also catching the wave of freedom after the collapse of former president moi 's 24-year rule .
thiong 'o and his fellow inmates are now demanding change .
" you ca n't solve any problem here without dealing with congestion .
also we want provision for basic necessities - blankets , for example , mattresses , good food , and we want a prisoner-friendly system and law , and less delays in processing our cases in court , " thiong 'o says .
" we are not here thinking about sex .
but if other countries can make provision for an inmate to meet his wife while in jail - why not us ?
we would also like that . " 1300 it is lunchtime and the prison staff conduct the second roll call of the day .
the smell of ugali and boiled vegetables mingling with the overpowering stench of raw sewage is everywhere .
until now , little was known about what went on inside prison walls in kenya .
there is no room for the new arrivals for many years , concerns have been raised over the inhuman conditions in kenyan jails and claims of torture , brutality and congestion have been frequent .
since coming to power two months ago , the new narc government , which overthrew kanu after four decades in power , has promised to review the prison system and improve the living conditions of more than 50,000 prisoners in the country .
but for now , the brutality and negligence which have been so present at nairobi prison is the hallmark of jails throughout kenya .
mr mwania , who has been in the prison service for 20 years , sums up the frustrations shared by the prison staff and prisoners : " the story is the same everywhere in our jails .
congestion because of delays in court cases , leading to more and more congestion .
lack of funds to provide for basic essentials for inmates .
simply , the system can not cope anymore . "
