as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy . in a report published by the european institute for tourism -lrb- eti -rrb- on monday , 41 percent of the german population said it feared a terrorist attack on holiday .
so it is perhaps not surprising that almost a third of germans say they would sooner stay at home this year than run the risk of taking a vacation .
in the past three months , the number of germans afraid to travel rose by more than ten percent - a figure likely to climb with the onset of war in iraq .
but the war itself isn ’ t unsettling would-be travelers as much as a deep-seated concern that heading abroad might make them a target for terrorists . attacks in djerba , tunisia and bali , indonesia over the past year claimed the lives of more than 20 german tourists .

but even those who say conflict and terrorism will not get in the way of their annual sojourn in the sunshine are being more selective about their vacation destination this year .
over 80 percent said they would not visit turkey and egypt during a war .
results for other top german holiday destinations including tunisia , morocco and the united states were not far behind .
almost half said they would keep their distance from great britain throughout the crisis .
package tour operators hardest hit already suffering in the wake of the september 11th terrorist attacks in the united states , the travel industry has had to become even more flexible with the outbreak of war in iraq .
hardest hit have been the large companies , such as package tour operators tui and thomas cook , which buy holidays in bulk to sell to sun-seeking customers far in advance .
with global uncertainty keeping people from making early reservations this year , companies are now slashing prices to catch the imagination of still undecided travelers .
some travel agents have also begun offering apprehensive passengers intending to travel to countries close to the fighting an option to rebook at no additional cost .
but the association for german travel agencies and tour companies -lrb- drv -rrb- said there was no guarantee that passengers could be able to back out of vacation plans without incurring fees .
" as long as the foreign ministry does not issue a travel warning , travel agents are not obliged to cover the costs of cancellation as a result of the war in iraq , " said drv spokeswoman sybille zeuch .
with many germans holding off making vacation plans to see how the situation in iraq develops , last-minute travel operators are hoping to gain where the package tour groups stand to loose .
by one estimate , some 12 million germans will opt for spur-of-the moment vacations this year , with companies such as l 'tur or 5 vor flug .

aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .
annan calls for urgent measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan in new york on monday , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said he believed urgent measures were required to restore power and water to the population .
" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .

aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .

" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .

concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .

as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy . in a report published by the european institute for tourism -lrb- eti -rrb- on monday , 41 percent of the german population said it feared a terrorist attack on holiday .
so it is perhaps not surprising that almost a third of germans say they would sooner stay at home this year than run the risk of taking a vacation .
in the past three months , the number of germans afraid to travel rose by more than ten percent - a figure likely to climb with the onset of war in iraq .
but the war itself isn ’ t unsettling would-be travelers as much as a deep-seated concern that heading abroad might make them a target for terrorists . attacks in djerba , tunisia and bali , indonesia over the past year claimed the lives of more than 20 german tourists .
the eti believes this fear , which half of german citizens share , is having the greatest influence on travelers as they make their summer holiday plans .
with a high standard of living and an average six weeks annual paid leave , germans are some of the world ’ s biggest globetrotters .
but even those who say conflict and terrorism will not get in the way of their annual sojourn in the sunshine are being more selective about their vacation destination this year .
over 80 percent said they would not visit turkey and egypt during a war .
results for other top german holiday destinations including tunisia , morocco and the united states were not far behind .
almost half said they would keep their distance from great britain throughout the crisis .
package tour operators hardest hit already suffering in the wake of the september 11th terrorist attacks in the united states , the travel industry has had to become even more flexible with the outbreak of war in iraq .
hardest hit have been the large companies , such as package tour operators tui and thomas cook , which buy holidays in bulk to sell to sun-seeking customers far in advance .
with global uncertainty keeping people from making early reservations this year , companies are now slashing prices to catch the imagination of still undecided travelers .
some travel agents have also begun offering apprehensive passengers intending to travel to countries close to the fighting an option to rebook at no additional cost .
but the association for german travel agencies and tour companies -lrb- drv -rrb- said there was no guarantee that passengers could be able to back out of vacation plans without incurring fees .
" as long as the foreign ministry does not issue a travel warning , travel agents are not obliged to cover the costs of cancellation as a result of the war in iraq , " said drv spokeswoman sybille zeuch .
with many germans holding off making vacation plans to see how the situation in iraq develops , last-minute travel operators are hoping to gain where the package tour groups stand to loose .
by one estimate , some 12 million germans will opt for spur-of-the moment vacations this year , with companies such as l 'tur or 5 vor flug .
opportunity for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmendorfer beach on the baltic coast .
despite germany ’ s strong opposition to the war , 33 percent of germans still fear terrorism on their own soil , according to the european institute for tourism report .
but eti manager bert hallerbach believes the conflict overseas opens up a great opportunity for germany ’ s domestic tourist industry . “ it ’ s a huge chance for regions in the countryside where there ’ s a small likelihood for attacks , ” said hallerbach .
and 75 percent of those surveyed by eti said that germany has become a genuine alternative vacation destination , with focus on tradition hot spots on the coasts along the north and baltic seas and the alpine region .
that could end up making the summer holidays at home a crowed affair , characterized more by traffic jams and overfilled hotels than sun and surf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

there is now a total number of seven soldiers listed as missing prisoners of war -lrb- pows -rrb- by the pentagon - a small number compared to the allegedly 2,000 iraqi prisoners of war captured by the allied forces .
nevertheless , the treatment of the american pows and the issue of media coverage has led to worldwide concerns and contempt international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush u.s president george w. bush and british premier tony blair sharply criticised the exposure of the american pows on television .

iraq 's defence minister , sultan hashim ahmed , said iraq would " not harm the captured prisoners of war " .

aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .
annan calls for urgent measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan in new york on monday , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said he believed urgent measures were required to restore power and water to the population .
" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .
conditions in the capital , baghdad , appear to be slightly less dramatic so far . huguenin told dw-tv that despite heavy aerial bombardment , electricity and waters services were still operating .
key port now under control a british commander said on tuesday that the southern port town of umm qasr , home to iraq 's only deep water harbor , and a key point of access for supplies , is now " safe and open , " a claim disputed by iraqi vice president taha yassin ramadan . brigadier jim dutton , commander of the british royal marines ' 3 commando brigade , told reporters he hoped the first ship bringing aid to iraq would arrive within 48 hours . british prime minister tony blair said on tuesday that there were " huge stockpiles " of humanitarian aid waiting to be brought in from kuwait . " all that is holding us back at present is the threat of iraqi mines , " blair told a news conference . the british supply ship sir galahad , laden with vital civilian supplies , is anchored offshore and is awaiting clearance to enter the port .
talks stalled negotiations to reinstate the u.n. oil-for-food program are set to resume at the united nations in new york on tuesday following the postponement of a security council resolution to restructure the program for 45 days .
reuters news agency quoted diplomats from the permanent security council members russia , france and china , as well as non-permanent member syria , all of which are staunchly opposed to the war , as saying they were wary of language that would have the united nations coordinate efforts with u.s.-led troops and thereby legitimize their military action .
russia , reuters said , is adamant that existing contracts remain unchanged , while germany , which also opposes the war but has remained neutral in this particular dispute , has been making compromise proposals in its capacity as chair of the panel monitoring the program . " we 're demanding , or hoping , that the coordination of the humanitarian aid will be carried out through the united nations , " wolfgang jamann , coordinator for the nonprofit aktion deutschland hilft , told dw-tv .
" we do n't believe that the warring parties should be able to coordinate or control humanitarian aid . "
the british international development minister , clare short , said in parliament on monday , " if this program is not reinstated , it would be very difficult to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
we have to get it up and running very quickly . "
us accused of breaching geneva convention the french aid organization action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- has accused the united states of using hunger as a weapon , which would be a breach of the geneva convention .
it also accused the united nations of playing into the hands of the u.s.-led coalition .
the french doctor jean-christophe rufin , president of action contre la faim , said kofi annan suspended the oil-for-food program without discussion or consultation .
" that means the people in iraq will only get food again when they capitulate , " he told dw-radio .
" aid will only come after the soldiers .
food is therefore being used as a form of pressure .
people are being left to starve . " the oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to ease human suffering caused by economic sanctions imposed in august 1990 after iraq invaded kuwait .
it allows the iraqi authorities to use oil revenues to purchase food , medicine and civilian goods .
baghdad has ordered and paid for goods worth some € 8.4 billion -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- whose delivery has been put off by the war .
16 million dependent on program the united nations estimates that 60 percent of the iraqi population of 26 million people -lrb- almost 16 million -rrb- have to rely on the program for food .
the u.n. children 's fund , unicef , says 1.3 million iraqi children under five already suffer from malnutrition .
the un world food program says it believes some 2.1 million people could require food aid over the next four weeks , while the entire population would need help if the war dragged on any longer .
eu willing to help rebuild iraq meanwhile , the european union 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , has said the eu would be willing to play its part in the reconstruction of iraq after the war .
but , he said , it could only do this with a u.n. mandate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german international development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the german international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- , meanwhile , said on german breakfast tv on tuesday that those responsible for the war should also bear the brunt of reconstruction costs . describing the war as " scandalous " , she said the united states would have to pay the lion 's share of the costs , while any reconstruction program would have to take place under the auspices of the united nations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links unicef official website world food programme -lrb- wfp -rrb- official website .

tv pictures of frightened u.s. soldiers , captured by iraqi military have been broadcast - and have sparked worldwide debate . the iraqi state television and the arab station al-jazeera showed video footage of five captured american soldiers – four men and one woman – on sunday , four days after the beginning of the war in iraq .
the soldiers were interviewed by iraqi officials and appeared frightened .
the footage also included pictures of dead bodies dressed in american uniforms wounded in the head .
on monday , iraqi television showed another two american pilots , from a u.s. helicopter lost on monday during an attack by several of the aircraft on iraqi republican guards near the town of kerbala .
there is now a total number of seven soldiers listed as missing prisoners of war -lrb- pows -rrb- by the pentagon - a small number compared to the allegedly 2,000 iraqi prisoners of war captured by the allied forces .
nevertheless , the treatment of the american pows and the issue of media coverage has led to worldwide concerns and contempt international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush u.s president george w. bush and british premier tony blair sharply criticised the exposure of the american pows on television .

" what i have seen so far , namely 2 captured helicopter pilots and interviews with four u.s. soldiers does not violate the protection against public curiosity " said ipsen on tuesday in bochum .
he stated that pictures of pows are part of the media coverage of the war just like footage of injured people in hospitals .
both the united states and iraq have signed the geneva conventions that date back to 1949 .
after world war ii , a conference was held in geneva on the protection of war victims and international humanitarian law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.03.2003 humanitarian crisis looms in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british artillery forces engage iraqi positions outside basra .
aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .
annan calls for urgent measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan in new york on monday , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said he believed urgent measures were required to restore power and water to the population .
" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .
conditions in the capital , baghdad , appear to be slightly less dramatic so far . huguenin told dw-tv that despite heavy aerial bombardment , electricity and waters services were still operating .
key port now under control a british commander said on tuesday that the southern port town of umm qasr , home to iraq 's only deep water harbor , and a key point of access for supplies , is now " safe and open , " a claim disputed by iraqi vice president taha yassin ramadan . brigadier jim dutton , commander of the british royal marines ' 3 commando brigade , told reporters he hoped the first ship bringing aid to iraq would arrive within 48 hours . british prime minister tony blair said on tuesday that there were " huge stockpiles " of humanitarian aid waiting to be brought in from kuwait . " all that is holding us back at present is the threat of iraqi mines , " blair told a news conference . the british supply ship sir galahad , laden with vital civilian supplies , is anchored offshore and is awaiting clearance to enter the port .
talks stalled negotiations to reinstate the u.n. oil-for-food program are set to resume at the united nations in new york on tuesday following the postponement of a security council resolution to restructure the program for 45 days .
reuters news agency quoted diplomats from the permanent security council members russia , france and china , as well as non-permanent member syria , all of which are staunchly opposed to the war , as saying they were wary of language that would have the united nations coordinate efforts with u.s.-led troops and thereby legitimize their military action .
russia , reuters said , is adamant that existing contracts remain unchanged , while germany , which also opposes the war but has remained neutral in this particular dispute , has been making compromise proposals in its capacity as chair of the panel monitoring the program . " we 're demanding , or hoping , that the coordination of the humanitarian aid will be carried out through the united nations , " wolfgang jamann , coordinator for the nonprofit aktion deutschland hilft , told dw-tv .
" we do n't believe that the warring parties should be able to coordinate or control humanitarian aid . "
the british international development minister , clare short , said in parliament on monday , " if this program is not reinstated , it would be very difficult to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
we have to get it up and running very quickly . "
us accused of breaching geneva convention the french aid organization action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- has accused the united states of using hunger as a weapon , which would be a breach of the geneva convention .
it also accused the united nations of playing into the hands of the u.s.-led coalition .
the french doctor jean-christophe rufin , president of action contre la faim , said kofi annan suspended the oil-for-food program without discussion or consultation .
" that means the people in iraq will only get food again when they capitulate , " he told dw-radio .
" aid will only come after the soldiers .
food is therefore being used as a form of pressure .
people are being left to starve . " the oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to ease human suffering caused by economic sanctions imposed in august 1990 after iraq invaded kuwait .
it allows the iraqi authorities to use oil revenues to purchase food , medicine and civilian goods .
baghdad has ordered and paid for goods worth some € 8.4 billion -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- whose delivery has been put off by the war .
16 million dependent on program the united nations estimates that 60 percent of the iraqi population of 26 million people -lrb- almost 16 million -rrb- have to rely on the program for food .
the u.n. children 's fund , unicef , says 1.3 million iraqi children under five already suffer from malnutrition .
the un world food program says it believes some 2.1 million people could require food aid over the next four weeks , while the entire population would need help if the war dragged on any longer .
eu willing to help rebuild iraq meanwhile , the european union 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , has said the eu would be willing to play its part in the reconstruction of iraq after the war .
but , he said , it could only do this with a u.n. mandate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german international development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the german international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- , meanwhile , said on german breakfast tv on tuesday that those responsible for the war should also bear the brunt of reconstruction costs . describing the war as " scandalous " , she said the united states would have to pay the lion 's share of the costs , while any reconstruction program would have to take place under the auspices of the united nations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links unicef official website world food programme -lrb- wfp -rrb- official website .

aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .
annan calls for urgent measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan in new york on monday , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said he believed urgent measures were required to restore power and water to the population .
" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .
conditions in the capital , baghdad , appear to be slightly less dramatic so far . huguenin told dw-tv that despite heavy aerial bombardment , electricity and waters services were still operating .
key port now under control a british commander said on tuesday that the southern port town of umm qasr , home to iraq 's only deep water harbor , and a key point of access for supplies , is now " safe and open , " a claim disputed by iraqi vice president taha yassin ramadan . brigadier jim dutton , commander of the british royal marines ' 3 commando brigade , told reporters he hoped the first ship bringing aid to iraq would arrive within 48 hours . british prime minister tony blair said on tuesday that there were " huge stockpiles " of humanitarian aid waiting to be brought in from kuwait .

reuters news agency quoted diplomats from the permanent security council members russia , france and china , as well as non-permanent member syria , all of which are staunchly opposed to the war , as saying they were wary of language that would have the united nations coordinate efforts with u.s.-led troops and thereby legitimize their military action .
russia , reuters said , is adamant that existing contracts remain unchanged , while germany , which also opposes the war but has remained neutral in this particular dispute , has been making compromise proposals in its capacity as chair of the panel monitoring the program . " we 're demanding , or hoping , that the coordination of the humanitarian aid will be carried out through the united nations , " wolfgang jamann , coordinator for the nonprofit aktion deutschland hilft , told dw-tv .
" we do n't believe that the warring parties should be able to coordinate or control humanitarian aid . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.03.2003 germans opt to stay home amid global uncertainty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airports like cologne-bonn could see fewer travelers this summer .
as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy . in a report published by the european institute for tourism -lrb- eti -rrb- on monday , 41 percent of the german population said it feared a terrorist attack on holiday .
so it is perhaps not surprising that almost a third of germans say they would sooner stay at home this year than run the risk of taking a vacation .
in the past three months , the number of germans afraid to travel rose by more than ten percent - a figure likely to climb with the onset of war in iraq .
but the war itself isn ’ t unsettling would-be travelers as much as a deep-seated concern that heading abroad might make them a target for terrorists . attacks in djerba , tunisia and bali , indonesia over the past year claimed the lives of more than 20 german tourists .
the eti believes this fear , which half of german citizens share , is having the greatest influence on travelers as they make their summer holiday plans .
with a high standard of living and an average six weeks annual paid leave , germans are some of the world ’ s biggest globetrotters .
but even those who say conflict and terrorism will not get in the way of their annual sojourn in the sunshine are being more selective about their vacation destination this year .
over 80 percent said they would not visit turkey and egypt during a war .
results for other top german holiday destinations including tunisia , morocco and the united states were not far behind .
almost half said they would keep their distance from great britain throughout the crisis .
package tour operators hardest hit already suffering in the wake of the september 11th terrorist attacks in the united states , the travel industry has had to become even more flexible with the outbreak of war in iraq .
hardest hit have been the large companies , such as package tour operators tui and thomas cook , which buy holidays in bulk to sell to sun-seeking customers far in advance .
with global uncertainty keeping people from making early reservations this year , companies are now slashing prices to catch the imagination of still undecided travelers .
some travel agents have also begun offering apprehensive passengers intending to travel to countries close to the fighting an option to rebook at no additional cost .
but the association for german travel agencies and tour companies -lrb- drv -rrb- said there was no guarantee that passengers could be able to back out of vacation plans without incurring fees .
" as long as the foreign ministry does not issue a travel warning , travel agents are not obliged to cover the costs of cancellation as a result of the war in iraq , " said drv spokeswoman sybille zeuch .
with many germans holding off making vacation plans to see how the situation in iraq develops , last-minute travel operators are hoping to gain where the package tour groups stand to loose .
by one estimate , some 12 million germans will opt for spur-of-the moment vacations this year , with companies such as l 'tur or 5 vor flug .
opportunity for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmendorfer beach on the baltic coast .
despite germany ’ s strong opposition to the war , 33 percent of germans still fear terrorism on their own soil , according to the european institute for tourism report .
but eti manager bert hallerbach believes the conflict overseas opens up a great opportunity for germany ’ s domestic tourist industry . “ it ’ s a huge chance for regions in the countryside where there ’ s a small likelihood for attacks , ” said hallerbach .
and 75 percent of those surveyed by eti said that germany has become a genuine alternative vacation destination , with focus on tradition hot spots on the coasts along the north and baltic seas and the alpine region .
that could end up making the summer holidays at home a crowed affair , characterized more by traffic jams and overfilled hotels than sun and surf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .
annan calls for urgent measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan in new york on monday , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said he believed urgent measures were required to restore power and water to the population .
" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .
conditions in the capital , baghdad , appear to be slightly less dramatic so far . huguenin told dw-tv that despite heavy aerial bombardment , electricity and waters services were still operating .
key port now under control a british commander said on tuesday that the southern port town of umm qasr , home to iraq 's only deep water harbor , and a key point of access for supplies , is now " safe and open , " a claim disputed by iraqi vice president taha yassin ramadan . brigadier jim dutton , commander of the british royal marines ' 3 commando brigade , told reporters he hoped the first ship bringing aid to iraq would arrive within 48 hours . british prime minister tony blair said on tuesday that there were " huge stockpiles " of humanitarian aid waiting to be brought in from kuwait . " all that is holding us back at present is the threat of iraqi mines , " blair told a news conference . the british supply ship sir galahad , laden with vital civilian supplies , is anchored offshore and is awaiting clearance to enter the port .
talks stalled negotiations to reinstate the u.n. oil-for-food program are set to resume at the united nations in new york on tuesday following the postponement of a security council resolution to restructure the program for 45 days .
reuters news agency quoted diplomats from the permanent security council members russia , france and china , as well as non-permanent member syria , all of which are staunchly opposed to the war , as saying they were wary of language that would have the united nations coordinate efforts with u.s.-led troops and thereby legitimize their military action .
russia , reuters said , is adamant that existing contracts remain unchanged , while germany , which also opposes the war but has remained neutral in this particular dispute , has been making compromise proposals in its capacity as chair of the panel monitoring the program . " we 're demanding , or hoping , that the coordination of the humanitarian aid will be carried out through the united nations , " wolfgang jamann , coordinator for the nonprofit aktion deutschland hilft , told dw-tv .
" we do n't believe that the warring parties should be able to coordinate or control humanitarian aid . "
the british international development minister , clare short , said in parliament on monday , " if this program is not reinstated , it would be very difficult to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
we have to get it up and running very quickly . "
us accused of breaching geneva convention the french aid organization action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- has accused the united states of using hunger as a weapon , which would be a breach of the geneva convention .
it also accused the united nations of playing into the hands of the u.s.-led coalition .
the french doctor jean-christophe rufin , president of action contre la faim , said kofi annan suspended the oil-for-food program without discussion or consultation .
" that means the people in iraq will only get food again when they capitulate , " he told dw-radio .
" aid will only come after the soldiers .
food is therefore being used as a form of pressure .
people are being left to starve . " the oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to ease human suffering caused by economic sanctions imposed in august 1990 after iraq invaded kuwait .
it allows the iraqi authorities to use oil revenues to purchase food , medicine and civilian goods .
baghdad has ordered and paid for goods worth some € 8.4 billion -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- whose delivery has been put off by the war .
16 million dependent on program the united nations estimates that 60 percent of the iraqi population of 26 million people -lrb- almost 16 million -rrb- have to rely on the program for food .
the u.n. children 's fund , unicef , says 1.3 million iraqi children under five already suffer from malnutrition .
the un world food program says it believes some 2.1 million people could require food aid over the next four weeks , while the entire population would need help if the war dragged on any longer .
eu willing to help rebuild iraq meanwhile , the european union 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , has said the eu would be willing to play its part in the reconstruction of iraq after the war .
but , he said , it could only do this with a u.n. mandate .

as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy . in a report published by the european institute for tourism -lrb- eti -rrb- on monday , 41 percent of the german population said it feared a terrorist attack on holiday .
so it is perhaps not surprising that almost a third of germans say they would sooner stay at home this year than run the risk of taking a vacation .
in the past three months , the number of germans afraid to travel rose by more than ten percent - a figure likely to climb with the onset of war in iraq .
but the war itself isn ’ t unsettling would-be travelers as much as a deep-seated concern that heading abroad might make them a target for terrorists . attacks in djerba , tunisia and bali , indonesia over the past year claimed the lives of more than 20 german tourists .
the eti believes this fear , which half of german citizens share , is having the greatest influence on travelers as they make their summer holiday plans .
with a high standard of living and an average six weeks annual paid leave , germans are some of the world ’ s biggest globetrotters .
but even those who say conflict and terrorism will not get in the way of their annual sojourn in the sunshine are being more selective about their vacation destination this year .
over 80 percent said they would not visit turkey and egypt during a war .
results for other top german holiday destinations including tunisia , morocco and the united states were not far behind .
almost half said they would keep their distance from great britain throughout the crisis .
package tour operators hardest hit already suffering in the wake of the september 11th terrorist attacks in the united states , the travel industry has had to become even more flexible with the outbreak of war in iraq .
hardest hit have been the large companies , such as package tour operators tui and thomas cook , which buy holidays in bulk to sell to sun-seeking customers far in advance .
with global uncertainty keeping people from making early reservations this year , companies are now slashing prices to catch the imagination of still undecided travelers .
some travel agents have also begun offering apprehensive passengers intending to travel to countries close to the fighting an option to rebook at no additional cost .
but the association for german travel agencies and tour companies -lrb- drv -rrb- said there was no guarantee that passengers could be able to back out of vacation plans without incurring fees .
" as long as the foreign ministry does not issue a travel warning , travel agents are not obliged to cover the costs of cancellation as a result of the war in iraq , " said drv spokeswoman sybille zeuch .
with many germans holding off making vacation plans to see how the situation in iraq develops , last-minute travel operators are hoping to gain where the package tour groups stand to loose .
by one estimate , some 12 million germans will opt for spur-of-the moment vacations this year , with companies such as l 'tur or 5 vor flug .

but eti manager bert hallerbach believes the conflict overseas opens up a great opportunity for germany ’ s domestic tourist industry . “ it ’ s a huge chance for regions in the countryside where there ’ s a small likelihood for attacks , ” said hallerbach .

tv pictures of frightened u.s. soldiers , captured by iraqi military have been broadcast - and have sparked worldwide debate . the iraqi state television and the arab station al-jazeera showed video footage of five captured american soldiers – four men and one woman – on sunday , four days after the beginning of the war in iraq .
the soldiers were interviewed by iraqi officials and appeared frightened .
the footage also included pictures of dead bodies dressed in american uniforms wounded in the head .
on monday , iraqi television showed another two american pilots , from a u.s. helicopter lost on monday during an attack by several of the aircraft on iraqi republican guards near the town of kerbala .
there is now a total number of seven soldiers listed as missing prisoners of war -lrb- pows -rrb- by the pentagon - a small number compared to the allegedly 2,000 iraqi prisoners of war captured by the allied forces .
nevertheless , the treatment of the american pows and the issue of media coverage has led to worldwide concerns and contempt international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush u.s president george w. bush and british premier tony blair sharply criticised the exposure of the american pows on television .
however , pictures of iraqi pows , captured by the allied forces have been previously shown on television networks all over the world .
in a speech to the un human rights commission on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to all warring parties to abide by international humanitarian laws .
iraq 's defence minister , sultan hashim ahmed , said iraq would " not harm the captured prisoners of war " .
he added : " it will treat them in accordance with the geneva convention on prisoners of war . "
the geneva conventions the international red cross is strongly opposed to showing any prisoners of war on television , stating article 13 of the geneva conventions : " prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated . -lrb- ... -rrb-
likewise , prisoners of war must at all times be protected , particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity .
but according to german red cross president knut ipsen , the media reports on the american soldiers captured in iraq do not violate the geneva conventions .
" what i have seen so far , namely 2 captured helicopter pilots and interviews with four u.s. soldiers does not violate the protection against public curiosity " said ipsen on tuesday in bochum .
he stated that pictures of pows are part of the media coverage of the war just like footage of injured people in hospitals .
both the united states and iraq have signed the geneva conventions that date back to 1949 .
after world war ii , a conference was held in geneva on the protection of war victims and international humanitarian law .
the international red cross controls if the parties at war abide by the geneva conventions , and has the right to access pows on both sides , making sure they are treated properly .
so far , the red cross expects no problems accessing pows in iraq .
personal tragedies shown on tv american audiences were spared the controversial footage at first or only got access to small snippets .
u.s. television networks mainly abided by the government 's request not to show the video footage .
short clips of the footage were first shown on cbs , later on cnn and nbc .
david westin , news editor of the tv channel abc said that pictures of dead american soldiers were n't " newsworthy " and that they had only been filmed to " create anger and disruption among the -lrb- american -rrb- people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph hudson indeed , anger and disruption was created among the families of the american pows .
anicita hudson , the mother of joseph hudson -lrb- photo -rrb- who was deployed to the gulf last month , told u.s. journalists that she had seen images of her son on a philippine channel to which she subcribes .
" i was shocked to see my son being interviewed " , she said , " all i did was scream and i started crying . "
bad memories come back british pilot john nichol knows first hand what it was like to be forced to appear on television after falling into enemy hands .
he was a pow in iraq during the last gulf war in 1991 .
" going on television was a humiliating , degrading , disgusting , despicable experience .
i did it under the threat of death , " he told bbc radio .
nichol thinks that iraqi assurances of treating the american pows according to the geneva conventions will bring little comfort to the victims .
" it must have been a horrific terrifying experience for the people there and their loved ones watching back home . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy . in a report published by the european institute for tourism -lrb- eti -rrb- on monday , 41 percent of the german population said it feared a terrorist attack on holiday .
so it is perhaps not surprising that almost a third of germans say they would sooner stay at home this year than run the risk of taking a vacation .
in the past three months , the number of germans afraid to travel rose by more than ten percent - a figure likely to climb with the onset of war in iraq .
but the war itself isn ’ t unsettling would-be travelers as much as a deep-seated concern that heading abroad might make them a target for terrorists . attacks in djerba , tunisia and bali , indonesia over the past year claimed the lives of more than 20 german tourists .
the eti believes this fear , which half of german citizens share , is having the greatest influence on travelers as they make their summer holiday plans .
with a high standard of living and an average six weeks annual paid leave , germans are some of the world ’ s biggest globetrotters .
but even those who say conflict and terrorism will not get in the way of their annual sojourn in the sunshine are being more selective about their vacation destination this year .
over 80 percent said they would not visit turkey and egypt during a war .

almost half said they would keep their distance from great britain throughout the crisis .
package tour operators hardest hit already suffering in the wake of the september 11th terrorist attacks in the united states , the travel industry has had to become even more flexible with the outbreak of war in iraq .
hardest hit have been the large companies , such as package tour operators tui and thomas cook , which buy holidays in bulk to sell to sun-seeking customers far in advance .
with global uncertainty keeping people from making early reservations this year , companies are now slashing prices to catch the imagination of still undecided travelers .
some travel agents have also begun offering apprehensive passengers intending to travel to countries close to the fighting an option to rebook at no additional cost .
but the association for german travel agencies and tour companies -lrb- drv -rrb- said there was no guarantee that passengers could be able to back out of vacation plans without incurring fees .
" as long as the foreign ministry does not issue a travel warning , travel agents are not obliged to cover the costs of cancellation as a result of the war in iraq , " said drv spokeswoman sybille zeuch .
with many germans holding off making vacation plans to see how the situation in iraq develops , last-minute travel operators are hoping to gain where the package tour groups stand to loose .

package tour operators hardest hit already suffering in the wake of the september 11th terrorist attacks in the united states , the travel industry has had to become even more flexible with the outbreak of war in iraq .
hardest hit have been the large companies , such as package tour operators tui and thomas cook , which buy holidays in bulk to sell to sun-seeking customers far in advance .
with global uncertainty keeping people from making early reservations this year , companies are now slashing prices to catch the imagination of still undecided travelers .
some travel agents have also begun offering apprehensive passengers intending to travel to countries close to the fighting an option to rebook at no additional cost .
but the association for german travel agencies and tour companies -lrb- drv -rrb- said there was no guarantee that passengers could be able to back out of vacation plans without incurring fees .
" as long as the foreign ministry does not issue a travel warning , travel agents are not obliged to cover the costs of cancellation as a result of the war in iraq , " said drv spokeswoman sybille zeuch .
with many germans holding off making vacation plans to see how the situation in iraq develops , last-minute travel operators are hoping to gain where the package tour groups stand to loose .
by one estimate , some 12 million germans will opt for spur-of-the moment vacations this year , with companies such as l 'tur or 5 vor flug .

despite germany ’ s strong opposition to the war , 33 percent of germans still fear terrorism on their own soil , according to the european institute for tourism report .
but eti manager bert hallerbach believes the conflict overseas opens up a great opportunity for germany ’ s domestic tourist industry . “ it ’ s a huge chance for regions in the countryside where there ’ s a small likelihood for attacks , ” said hallerbach .
and 75 percent of those surveyed by eti said that germany has become a genuine alternative vacation destination , with focus on tradition hot spots on the coasts along the north and baltic seas and the alpine region .

aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .
annan calls for urgent measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan in new york on monday , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said he believed urgent measures were required to restore power and water to the population .
" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .
conditions in the capital , baghdad , appear to be slightly less dramatic so far . huguenin told dw-tv that despite heavy aerial bombardment , electricity and waters services were still operating .
key port now under control a british commander said on tuesday that the southern port town of umm qasr , home to iraq 's only deep water harbor , and a key point of access for supplies , is now " safe and open , " a claim disputed by iraqi vice president taha yassin ramadan . brigadier jim dutton , commander of the british royal marines ' 3 commando brigade , told reporters he hoped the first ship bringing aid to iraq would arrive within 48 hours . british prime minister tony blair said on tuesday that there were " huge stockpiles " of humanitarian aid waiting to be brought in from kuwait . " all that is holding us back at present is the threat of iraqi mines , " blair told a news conference . the british supply ship sir galahad , laden with vital civilian supplies , is anchored offshore and is awaiting clearance to enter the port .
talks stalled negotiations to reinstate the u.n. oil-for-food program are set to resume at the united nations in new york on tuesday following the postponement of a security council resolution to restructure the program for 45 days .
reuters news agency quoted diplomats from the permanent security council members russia , france and china , as well as non-permanent member syria , all of which are staunchly opposed to the war , as saying they were wary of language that would have the united nations coordinate efforts with u.s.-led troops and thereby legitimize their military action .
russia , reuters said , is adamant that existing contracts remain unchanged , while germany , which also opposes the war but has remained neutral in this particular dispute , has been making compromise proposals in its capacity as chair of the panel monitoring the program . " we 're demanding , or hoping , that the coordination of the humanitarian aid will be carried out through the united nations , " wolfgang jamann , coordinator for the nonprofit aktion deutschland hilft , told dw-tv .
" we do n't believe that the warring parties should be able to coordinate or control humanitarian aid . "
the british international development minister , clare short , said in parliament on monday , " if this program is not reinstated , it would be very difficult to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
we have to get it up and running very quickly . "
us accused of breaching geneva convention the french aid organization action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- has accused the united states of using hunger as a weapon , which would be a breach of the geneva convention .
it also accused the united nations of playing into the hands of the u.s.-led coalition .
the french doctor jean-christophe rufin , president of action contre la faim , said kofi annan suspended the oil-for-food program without discussion or consultation .
" that means the people in iraq will only get food again when they capitulate , " he told dw-radio .
" aid will only come after the soldiers .
food is therefore being used as a form of pressure .
people are being left to starve . " the oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to ease human suffering caused by economic sanctions imposed in august 1990 after iraq invaded kuwait .
it allows the iraqi authorities to use oil revenues to purchase food , medicine and civilian goods .
baghdad has ordered and paid for goods worth some € 8.4 billion -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- whose delivery has been put off by the war .
16 million dependent on program the united nations estimates that 60 percent of the iraqi population of 26 million people -lrb- almost 16 million -rrb- have to rely on the program for food .
the u.n. children 's fund , unicef , says 1.3 million iraqi children under five already suffer from malnutrition .
the un world food program says it believes some 2.1 million people could require food aid over the next four weeks , while the entire population would need help if the war dragged on any longer .
eu willing to help rebuild iraq meanwhile , the european union 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , has said the eu would be willing to play its part in the reconstruction of iraq after the war .
but , he said , it could only do this with a u.n. mandate .

situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .
annan calls for urgent measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan in new york on monday , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said he believed urgent measures were required to restore power and water to the population .
" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .
conditions in the capital , baghdad , appear to be slightly less dramatic so far . huguenin told dw-tv that despite heavy aerial bombardment , electricity and waters services were still operating .
key port now under control a british commander said on tuesday that the southern port town of umm qasr , home to iraq 's only deep water harbor , and a key point of access for supplies , is now " safe and open , " a claim disputed by iraqi vice president taha yassin ramadan . brigadier jim dutton , commander of the british royal marines ' 3 commando brigade , told reporters he hoped the first ship bringing aid to iraq would arrive within 48 hours . british prime minister tony blair said on tuesday that there were " huge stockpiles " of humanitarian aid waiting to be brought in from kuwait . " all that is holding us back at present is the threat of iraqi mines , " blair told a news conference . the british supply ship sir galahad , laden with vital civilian supplies , is anchored offshore and is awaiting clearance to enter the port .
talks stalled negotiations to reinstate the u.n. oil-for-food program are set to resume at the united nations in new york on tuesday following the postponement of a security council resolution to restructure the program for 45 days .
reuters news agency quoted diplomats from the permanent security council members russia , france and china , as well as non-permanent member syria , all of which are staunchly opposed to the war , as saying they were wary of language that would have the united nations coordinate efforts with u.s.-led troops and thereby legitimize their military action .
russia , reuters said , is adamant that existing contracts remain unchanged , while germany , which also opposes the war but has remained neutral in this particular dispute , has been making compromise proposals in its capacity as chair of the panel monitoring the program . " we 're demanding , or hoping , that the coordination of the humanitarian aid will be carried out through the united nations , " wolfgang jamann , coordinator for the nonprofit aktion deutschland hilft , told dw-tv .
" we do n't believe that the warring parties should be able to coordinate or control humanitarian aid . "
the british international development minister , clare short , said in parliament on monday , " if this program is not reinstated , it would be very difficult to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
we have to get it up and running very quickly . "
us accused of breaching geneva convention the french aid organization action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- has accused the united states of using hunger as a weapon , which would be a breach of the geneva convention .
it also accused the united nations of playing into the hands of the u.s.-led coalition .
the french doctor jean-christophe rufin , president of action contre la faim , said kofi annan suspended the oil-for-food program without discussion or consultation .
" that means the people in iraq will only get food again when they capitulate , " he told dw-radio .
" aid will only come after the soldiers .
food is therefore being used as a form of pressure .
people are being left to starve . " the oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to ease human suffering caused by economic sanctions imposed in august 1990 after iraq invaded kuwait .
it allows the iraqi authorities to use oil revenues to purchase food , medicine and civilian goods .
baghdad has ordered and paid for goods worth some € 8.4 billion -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- whose delivery has been put off by the war .
16 million dependent on program the united nations estimates that 60 percent of the iraqi population of 26 million people -lrb- almost 16 million -rrb- have to rely on the program for food .
the u.n. children 's fund , unicef , says 1.3 million iraqi children under five already suffer from malnutrition .
the un world food program says it believes some 2.1 million people could require food aid over the next four weeks , while the entire population would need help if the war dragged on any longer .
eu willing to help rebuild iraq meanwhile , the european union 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , has said the eu would be willing to play its part in the reconstruction of iraq after the war .
but , he said , it could only do this with a u.n. mandate .

tv pictures of frightened u.s. soldiers , captured by iraqi military have been broadcast - and have sparked worldwide debate . the iraqi state television and the arab station al-jazeera showed video footage of five captured american soldiers – four men and one woman – on sunday , four days after the beginning of the war in iraq .
the soldiers were interviewed by iraqi officials and appeared frightened .
the footage also included pictures of dead bodies dressed in american uniforms wounded in the head .
on monday , iraqi television showed another two american pilots , from a u.s. helicopter lost on monday during an attack by several of the aircraft on iraqi republican guards near the town of kerbala .
there is now a total number of seven soldiers listed as missing prisoners of war -lrb- pows -rrb- by the pentagon - a small number compared to the allegedly 2,000 iraqi prisoners of war captured by the allied forces .
nevertheless , the treatment of the american pows and the issue of media coverage has led to worldwide concerns and contempt international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush u.s president george w. bush and british premier tony blair sharply criticised the exposure of the american pows on television .
however , pictures of iraqi pows , captured by the allied forces have been previously shown on television networks all over the world .
in a speech to the un human rights commission on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to all warring parties to abide by international humanitarian laws .
iraq 's defence minister , sultan hashim ahmed , said iraq would " not harm the captured prisoners of war " .
he added : " it will treat them in accordance with the geneva convention on prisoners of war . "
the geneva conventions the international red cross is strongly opposed to showing any prisoners of war on television , stating article 13 of the geneva conventions : " prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated . -lrb- ... -rrb-
likewise , prisoners of war must at all times be protected , particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity .
but according to german red cross president knut ipsen , the media reports on the american soldiers captured in iraq do not violate the geneva conventions .
" what i have seen so far , namely 2 captured helicopter pilots and interviews with four u.s. soldiers does not violate the protection against public curiosity " said ipsen on tuesday in bochum .
he stated that pictures of pows are part of the media coverage of the war just like footage of injured people in hospitals .
both the united states and iraq have signed the geneva conventions that date back to 1949 .
after world war ii , a conference was held in geneva on the protection of war victims and international humanitarian law .
the international red cross controls if the parties at war abide by the geneva conventions , and has the right to access pows on both sides , making sure they are treated properly .
so far , the red cross expects no problems accessing pows in iraq .

tv pictures of frightened u.s. soldiers , captured by iraqi military have been broadcast - and have sparked worldwide debate . the iraqi state television and the arab station al-jazeera showed video footage of five captured american soldiers – four men and one woman – on sunday , four days after the beginning of the war in iraq .
the soldiers were interviewed by iraqi officials and appeared frightened .
the footage also included pictures of dead bodies dressed in american uniforms wounded in the head .
on monday , iraqi television showed another two american pilots , from a u.s. helicopter lost on monday during an attack by several of the aircraft on iraqi republican guards near the town of kerbala .
there is now a total number of seven soldiers listed as missing prisoners of war -lrb- pows -rrb- by the pentagon - a small number compared to the allegedly 2,000 iraqi prisoners of war captured by the allied forces .
nevertheless , the treatment of the american pows and the issue of media coverage has led to worldwide concerns and contempt international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush u.s president george w. bush and british premier tony blair sharply criticised the exposure of the american pows on television .
however , pictures of iraqi pows , captured by the allied forces have been previously shown on television networks all over the world .

aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .
annan calls for urgent measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan in new york on monday , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said he believed urgent measures were required to restore power and water to the population .
" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .

a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .

concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .

as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy . in a report published by the european institute for tourism -lrb- eti -rrb- on monday , 41 percent of the german population said it feared a terrorist attack on holiday .
so it is perhaps not surprising that almost a third of germans say they would sooner stay at home this year than run the risk of taking a vacation .
in the past three months , the number of germans afraid to travel rose by more than ten percent - a figure likely to climb with the onset of war in iraq .
but the war itself isn ’ t unsettling would-be travelers as much as a deep-seated concern that heading abroad might make them a target for terrorists . attacks in djerba , tunisia and bali , indonesia over the past year claimed the lives of more than 20 german tourists .
the eti believes this fear , which half of german citizens share , is having the greatest influence on travelers as they make their summer holiday plans .
with a high standard of living and an average six weeks annual paid leave , germans are some of the world ’ s biggest globetrotters .
but even those who say conflict and terrorism will not get in the way of their annual sojourn in the sunshine are being more selective about their vacation destination this year .
over 80 percent said they would not visit turkey and egypt during a war .
results for other top german holiday destinations including tunisia , morocco and the united states were not far behind .
almost half said they would keep their distance from great britain throughout the crisis .
package tour operators hardest hit already suffering in the wake of the september 11th terrorist attacks in the united states , the travel industry has had to become even more flexible with the outbreak of war in iraq .
hardest hit have been the large companies , such as package tour operators tui and thomas cook , which buy holidays in bulk to sell to sun-seeking customers far in advance .
with global uncertainty keeping people from making early reservations this year , companies are now slashing prices to catch the imagination of still undecided travelers .
some travel agents have also begun offering apprehensive passengers intending to travel to countries close to the fighting an option to rebook at no additional cost .
but the association for german travel agencies and tour companies -lrb- drv -rrb- said there was no guarantee that passengers could be able to back out of vacation plans without incurring fees .
" as long as the foreign ministry does not issue a travel warning , travel agents are not obliged to cover the costs of cancellation as a result of the war in iraq , " said drv spokeswoman sybille zeuch .
with many germans holding off making vacation plans to see how the situation in iraq develops , last-minute travel operators are hoping to gain where the package tour groups stand to loose .
by one estimate , some 12 million germans will opt for spur-of-the moment vacations this year , with companies such as l 'tur or 5 vor flug .
opportunity for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmendorfer beach on the baltic coast .
despite germany ’ s strong opposition to the war , 33 percent of germans still fear terrorism on their own soil , according to the european institute for tourism report .
but eti manager bert hallerbach believes the conflict overseas opens up a great opportunity for germany ’ s domestic tourist industry . “ it ’ s a huge chance for regions in the countryside where there ’ s a small likelihood for attacks , ” said hallerbach .
and 75 percent of those surveyed by eti said that germany has become a genuine alternative vacation destination , with focus on tradition hot spots on the coasts along the north and baltic seas and the alpine region .
that could end up making the summer holidays at home a crowed affair , characterized more by traffic jams and overfilled hotels than sun and surf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .
annan calls for urgent measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan in new york on monday , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said he believed urgent measures were required to restore power and water to the population .
" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .
conditions in the capital , baghdad , appear to be slightly less dramatic so far . huguenin told dw-tv that despite heavy aerial bombardment , electricity and waters services were still operating .
key port now under control a british commander said on tuesday that the southern port town of umm qasr , home to iraq 's only deep water harbor , and a key point of access for supplies , is now " safe and open , " a claim disputed by iraqi vice president taha yassin ramadan . brigadier jim dutton , commander of the british royal marines ' 3 commando brigade , told reporters he hoped the first ship bringing aid to iraq would arrive within 48 hours . british prime minister tony blair said on tuesday that there were " huge stockpiles " of humanitarian aid waiting to be brought in from kuwait . " all that is holding us back at present is the threat of iraqi mines , " blair told a news conference . the british supply ship sir galahad , laden with vital civilian supplies , is anchored offshore and is awaiting clearance to enter the port .
talks stalled negotiations to reinstate the u.n. oil-for-food program are set to resume at the united nations in new york on tuesday following the postponement of a security council resolution to restructure the program for 45 days .
reuters news agency quoted diplomats from the permanent security council members russia , france and china , as well as non-permanent member syria , all of which are staunchly opposed to the war , as saying they were wary of language that would have the united nations coordinate efforts with u.s.-led troops and thereby legitimize their military action .
russia , reuters said , is adamant that existing contracts remain unchanged , while germany , which also opposes the war but has remained neutral in this particular dispute , has been making compromise proposals in its capacity as chair of the panel monitoring the program . " we 're demanding , or hoping , that the coordination of the humanitarian aid will be carried out through the united nations , " wolfgang jamann , coordinator for the nonprofit aktion deutschland hilft , told dw-tv .
" we do n't believe that the warring parties should be able to coordinate or control humanitarian aid . "
the british international development minister , clare short , said in parliament on monday , " if this program is not reinstated , it would be very difficult to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
we have to get it up and running very quickly . "
us accused of breaching geneva convention the french aid organization action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- has accused the united states of using hunger as a weapon , which would be a breach of the geneva convention .
it also accused the united nations of playing into the hands of the u.s.-led coalition .
the french doctor jean-christophe rufin , president of action contre la faim , said kofi annan suspended the oil-for-food program without discussion or consultation .
" that means the people in iraq will only get food again when they capitulate , " he told dw-radio .
" aid will only come after the soldiers .
food is therefore being used as a form of pressure .
people are being left to starve . " the oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to ease human suffering caused by economic sanctions imposed in august 1990 after iraq invaded kuwait .
it allows the iraqi authorities to use oil revenues to purchase food , medicine and civilian goods .
baghdad has ordered and paid for goods worth some € 8.4 billion -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- whose delivery has been put off by the war .
16 million dependent on program the united nations estimates that 60 percent of the iraqi population of 26 million people -lrb- almost 16 million -rrb- have to rely on the program for food .
the u.n. children 's fund , unicef , says 1.3 million iraqi children under five already suffer from malnutrition .
the un world food program says it believes some 2.1 million people could require food aid over the next four weeks , while the entire population would need help if the war dragged on any longer .
eu willing to help rebuild iraq meanwhile , the european union 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , has said the eu would be willing to play its part in the reconstruction of iraq after the war .
but , he said , it could only do this with a u.n. mandate .

tv pictures of frightened u.s. soldiers , captured by iraqi military have been broadcast - and have sparked worldwide debate . the iraqi state television and the arab station al-jazeera showed video footage of five captured american soldiers – four men and one woman – on sunday , four days after the beginning of the war in iraq .
the soldiers were interviewed by iraqi officials and appeared frightened .
the footage also included pictures of dead bodies dressed in american uniforms wounded in the head .
on monday , iraqi television showed another two american pilots , from a u.s. helicopter lost on monday during an attack by several of the aircraft on iraqi republican guards near the town of kerbala .
there is now a total number of seven soldiers listed as missing prisoners of war -lrb- pows -rrb- by the pentagon - a small number compared to the allegedly 2,000 iraqi prisoners of war captured by the allied forces .
nevertheless , the treatment of the american pows and the issue of media coverage has led to worldwide concerns and contempt international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush u.s president george w. bush and british premier tony blair sharply criticised the exposure of the american pows on television .
however , pictures of iraqi pows , captured by the allied forces have been previously shown on television networks all over the world .
in a speech to the un human rights commission on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to all warring parties to abide by international humanitarian laws .
iraq 's defence minister , sultan hashim ahmed , said iraq would " not harm the captured prisoners of war " .
he added : " it will treat them in accordance with the geneva convention on prisoners of war . "
the geneva conventions the international red cross is strongly opposed to showing any prisoners of war on television , stating article 13 of the geneva conventions : " prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated . -lrb- ... -rrb-
likewise , prisoners of war must at all times be protected , particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity .
but according to german red cross president knut ipsen , the media reports on the american soldiers captured in iraq do not violate the geneva conventions .
" what i have seen so far , namely 2 captured helicopter pilots and interviews with four u.s. soldiers does not violate the protection against public curiosity " said ipsen on tuesday in bochum .
he stated that pictures of pows are part of the media coverage of the war just like footage of injured people in hospitals .
both the united states and iraq have signed the geneva conventions that date back to 1949 .
after world war ii , a conference was held in geneva on the protection of war victims and international humanitarian law .
the international red cross controls if the parties at war abide by the geneva conventions , and has the right to access pows on both sides , making sure they are treated properly .

as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy . in a report published by the european institute for tourism -lrb- eti -rrb- on monday , 41 percent of the german population said it feared a terrorist attack on holiday .
so it is perhaps not surprising that almost a third of germans say they would sooner stay at home this year than run the risk of taking a vacation .
in the past three months , the number of germans afraid to travel rose by more than ten percent - a figure likely to climb with the onset of war in iraq .
but the war itself isn ’ t unsettling would-be travelers as much as a deep-seated concern that heading abroad might make them a target for terrorists . attacks in djerba , tunisia and bali , indonesia over the past year claimed the lives of more than 20 german tourists .
the eti believes this fear , which half of german citizens share , is having the greatest influence on travelers as they make their summer holiday plans .
with a high standard of living and an average six weeks annual paid leave , germans are some of the world ’ s biggest globetrotters .
but even those who say conflict and terrorism will not get in the way of their annual sojourn in the sunshine are being more selective about their vacation destination this year .
over 80 percent said they would not visit turkey and egypt during a war .
results for other top german holiday destinations including tunisia , morocco and the united states were not far behind .
almost half said they would keep their distance from great britain throughout the crisis .
package tour operators hardest hit already suffering in the wake of the september 11th terrorist attacks in the united states , the travel industry has had to become even more flexible with the outbreak of war in iraq .
hardest hit have been the large companies , such as package tour operators tui and thomas cook , which buy holidays in bulk to sell to sun-seeking customers far in advance .
with global uncertainty keeping people from making early reservations this year , companies are now slashing prices to catch the imagination of still undecided travelers .
some travel agents have also begun offering apprehensive passengers intending to travel to countries close to the fighting an option to rebook at no additional cost .
but the association for german travel agencies and tour companies -lrb- drv -rrb- said there was no guarantee that passengers could be able to back out of vacation plans without incurring fees .
" as long as the foreign ministry does not issue a travel warning , travel agents are not obliged to cover the costs of cancellation as a result of the war in iraq , " said drv spokeswoman sybille zeuch .
with many germans holding off making vacation plans to see how the situation in iraq develops , last-minute travel operators are hoping to gain where the package tour groups stand to loose .
by one estimate , some 12 million germans will opt for spur-of-the moment vacations this year , with companies such as l 'tur or 5 vor flug .

a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .

aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .
conditions in the capital , baghdad , appear to be slightly less dramatic so far . huguenin told dw-tv that despite heavy aerial bombardment , electricity and waters services were still operating .
key port now under control a british commander said on tuesday that the southern port town of umm qasr , home to iraq 's only deep water harbor , and a key point of access for supplies , is now " safe and open , " a claim disputed by iraqi vice president taha yassin ramadan . brigadier jim dutton , commander of the british royal marines ' 3 commando brigade , told reporters he hoped the first ship bringing aid to iraq would arrive within 48 hours . british prime minister tony blair said on tuesday that there were " huge stockpiles " of humanitarian aid waiting to be brought in from kuwait . " all that is holding us back at present is the threat of iraqi mines , " blair told a news conference . the british supply ship sir galahad , laden with vital civilian supplies , is anchored offshore and is awaiting clearance to enter the port .
talks stalled negotiations to reinstate the u.n. oil-for-food program are set to resume at the united nations in new york on tuesday following the postponement of a security council resolution to restructure the program for 45 days .
reuters news agency quoted diplomats from the permanent security council members russia , france and china , as well as non-permanent member syria , all of which are staunchly opposed to the war , as saying they were wary of language that would have the united nations coordinate efforts with u.s.-led troops and thereby legitimize their military action .
russia , reuters said , is adamant that existing contracts remain unchanged , while germany , which also opposes the war but has remained neutral in this particular dispute , has been making compromise proposals in its capacity as chair of the panel monitoring the program . " we 're demanding , or hoping , that the coordination of the humanitarian aid will be carried out through the united nations , " wolfgang jamann , coordinator for the nonprofit aktion deutschland hilft , told dw-tv .
" we do n't believe that the warring parties should be able to coordinate or control humanitarian aid . "
the british international development minister , clare short , said in parliament on monday , " if this program is not reinstated , it would be very difficult to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
we have to get it up and running very quickly . "
us accused of breaching geneva convention the french aid organization action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- has accused the united states of using hunger as a weapon , which would be a breach of the geneva convention .
it also accused the united nations of playing into the hands of the u.s.-led coalition .
the french doctor jean-christophe rufin , president of action contre la faim , said kofi annan suspended the oil-for-food program without discussion or consultation .
" that means the people in iraq will only get food again when they capitulate , " he told dw-radio .
" aid will only come after the soldiers .
food is therefore being used as a form of pressure .
people are being left to starve . " the oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to ease human suffering caused by economic sanctions imposed in august 1990 after iraq invaded kuwait .
it allows the iraqi authorities to use oil revenues to purchase food , medicine and civilian goods .
baghdad has ordered and paid for goods worth some € 8.4 billion -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- whose delivery has been put off by the war .
16 million dependent on program the united nations estimates that 60 percent of the iraqi population of 26 million people -lrb- almost 16 million -rrb- have to rely on the program for food .
the u.n. children 's fund , unicef , says 1.3 million iraqi children under five already suffer from malnutrition .
the un world food program says it believes some 2.1 million people could require food aid over the next four weeks , while the entire population would need help if the war dragged on any longer .
eu willing to help rebuild iraq meanwhile , the european union 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , has said the eu would be willing to play its part in the reconstruction of iraq after the war .
but , he said , it could only do this with a u.n. mandate .

aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .

as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy . in a report published by the european institute for tourism -lrb- eti -rrb- on monday , 41 percent of the german population said it feared a terrorist attack on holiday .
so it is perhaps not surprising that almost a third of germans say they would sooner stay at home this year than run the risk of taking a vacation .
in the past three months , the number of germans afraid to travel rose by more than ten percent - a figure likely to climb with the onset of war in iraq .
but the war itself isn ’ t unsettling would-be travelers as much as a deep-seated concern that heading abroad might make them a target for terrorists . attacks in djerba , tunisia and bali , indonesia over the past year claimed the lives of more than 20 german tourists .

hardest hit have been the large companies , such as package tour operators tui and thomas cook , which buy holidays in bulk to sell to sun-seeking customers far in advance .
with global uncertainty keeping people from making early reservations this year , companies are now slashing prices to catch the imagination of still undecided travelers .
some travel agents have also begun offering apprehensive passengers intending to travel to countries close to the fighting an option to rebook at no additional cost .
but the association for german travel agencies and tour companies -lrb- drv -rrb- said there was no guarantee that passengers could be able to back out of vacation plans without incurring fees .
" as long as the foreign ministry does not issue a travel warning , travel agents are not obliged to cover the costs of cancellation as a result of the war in iraq , " said drv spokeswoman sybille zeuch .
with many germans holding off making vacation plans to see how the situation in iraq develops , last-minute travel operators are hoping to gain where the package tour groups stand to loose .

as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy . in a report published by the european institute for tourism -lrb- eti -rrb- on monday , 41 percent of the german population said it feared a terrorist attack on holiday .
so it is perhaps not surprising that almost a third of germans say they would sooner stay at home this year than run the risk of taking a vacation .
in the past three months , the number of germans afraid to travel rose by more than ten percent - a figure likely to climb with the onset of war in iraq .
but the war itself isn ’ t unsettling would-be travelers as much as a deep-seated concern that heading abroad might make them a target for terrorists . attacks in djerba , tunisia and bali , indonesia over the past year claimed the lives of more than 20 german tourists .
the eti believes this fear , which half of german citizens share , is having the greatest influence on travelers as they make their summer holiday plans .
with a high standard of living and an average six weeks annual paid leave , germans are some of the world ’ s biggest globetrotters .
but even those who say conflict and terrorism will not get in the way of their annual sojourn in the sunshine are being more selective about their vacation destination this year .
over 80 percent said they would not visit turkey and egypt during a war .
results for other top german holiday destinations including tunisia , morocco and the united states were not far behind .
almost half said they would keep their distance from great britain throughout the crisis .
package tour operators hardest hit already suffering in the wake of the september 11th terrorist attacks in the united states , the travel industry has had to become even more flexible with the outbreak of war in iraq .
hardest hit have been the large companies , such as package tour operators tui and thomas cook , which buy holidays in bulk to sell to sun-seeking customers far in advance .
with global uncertainty keeping people from making early reservations this year , companies are now slashing prices to catch the imagination of still undecided travelers .
some travel agents have also begun offering apprehensive passengers intending to travel to countries close to the fighting an option to rebook at no additional cost .
but the association for german travel agencies and tour companies -lrb- drv -rrb- said there was no guarantee that passengers could be able to back out of vacation plans without incurring fees .
" as long as the foreign ministry does not issue a travel warning , travel agents are not obliged to cover the costs of cancellation as a result of the war in iraq , " said drv spokeswoman sybille zeuch .
with many germans holding off making vacation plans to see how the situation in iraq develops , last-minute travel operators are hoping to gain where the package tour groups stand to loose .
by one estimate , some 12 million germans will opt for spur-of-the moment vacations this year , with companies such as l 'tur or 5 vor flug .
opportunity for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : timmendorfer beach on the baltic coast .
despite germany ’ s strong opposition to the war , 33 percent of germans still fear terrorism on their own soil , according to the european institute for tourism report .
but eti manager bert hallerbach believes the conflict overseas opens up a great opportunity for germany ’ s domestic tourist industry . “ it ’ s a huge chance for regions in the countryside where there ’ s a small likelihood for attacks , ” said hallerbach .
and 75 percent of those surveyed by eti said that germany has become a genuine alternative vacation destination , with focus on tradition hot spots on the coasts along the north and baltic seas and the alpine region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.03.2003 controversy over media coverage of prisoners of war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied soldiers take prisoners of war in iraq only days after the start war in iraq , prisoners of war have been taken on both sides .
tv pictures of frightened u.s. soldiers , captured by iraqi military have been broadcast - and have sparked worldwide debate . the iraqi state television and the arab station al-jazeera showed video footage of five captured american soldiers – four men and one woman – on sunday , four days after the beginning of the war in iraq .
the soldiers were interviewed by iraqi officials and appeared frightened .
the footage also included pictures of dead bodies dressed in american uniforms wounded in the head .
on monday , iraqi television showed another two american pilots , from a u.s. helicopter lost on monday during an attack by several of the aircraft on iraqi republican guards near the town of kerbala .
there is now a total number of seven soldiers listed as missing prisoners of war -lrb- pows -rrb- by the pentagon - a small number compared to the allegedly 2,000 iraqi prisoners of war captured by the allied forces .
nevertheless , the treatment of the american pows and the issue of media coverage has led to worldwide concerns and contempt international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush u.s president george w. bush and british premier tony blair sharply criticised the exposure of the american pows on television .
however , pictures of iraqi pows , captured by the allied forces have been previously shown on television networks all over the world .
in a speech to the un human rights commission on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to all warring parties to abide by international humanitarian laws .
iraq 's defence minister , sultan hashim ahmed , said iraq would " not harm the captured prisoners of war " .
he added : " it will treat them in accordance with the geneva convention on prisoners of war . "
the geneva conventions the international red cross is strongly opposed to showing any prisoners of war on television , stating article 13 of the geneva conventions : " prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated . -lrb- ... -rrb-
likewise , prisoners of war must at all times be protected , particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity .
but according to german red cross president knut ipsen , the media reports on the american soldiers captured in iraq do not violate the geneva conventions .
" what i have seen so far , namely 2 captured helicopter pilots and interviews with four u.s. soldiers does not violate the protection against public curiosity " said ipsen on tuesday in bochum .
he stated that pictures of pows are part of the media coverage of the war just like footage of injured people in hospitals .
both the united states and iraq have signed the geneva conventions that date back to 1949 .
after world war ii , a conference was held in geneva on the protection of war victims and international humanitarian law .
the international red cross controls if the parties at war abide by the geneva conventions , and has the right to access pows on both sides , making sure they are treated properly .
so far , the red cross expects no problems accessing pows in iraq .
personal tragedies shown on tv american audiences were spared the controversial footage at first or only got access to small snippets .
u.s. television networks mainly abided by the government 's request not to show the video footage .
short clips of the footage were first shown on cbs , later on cnn and nbc .
david westin , news editor of the tv channel abc said that pictures of dead american soldiers were n't " newsworthy " and that they had only been filmed to " create anger and disruption among the -lrb- american -rrb- people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph hudson indeed , anger and disruption was created among the families of the american pows .
anicita hudson , the mother of joseph hudson -lrb- photo -rrb- who was deployed to the gulf last month , told u.s. journalists that she had seen images of her son on a philippine channel to which she subcribes .
" i was shocked to see my son being interviewed " , she said , " all i did was scream and i started crying . "
bad memories come back british pilot john nichol knows first hand what it was like to be forced to appear on television after falling into enemy hands .
he was a pow in iraq during the last gulf war in 1991 .
" going on television was a humiliating , degrading , disgusting , despicable experience .
i did it under the threat of death , " he told bbc radio .
nichol thinks that iraqi assurances of treating the american pows according to the geneva conventions will bring little comfort to the victims .
" it must have been a horrific terrifying experience for the people there and their loved ones watching back home . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .
annan calls for urgent measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan in new york on monday , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said he believed urgent measures were required to restore power and water to the population .
" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .
conditions in the capital , baghdad , appear to be slightly less dramatic so far . huguenin told dw-tv that despite heavy aerial bombardment , electricity and waters services were still operating .
key port now under control a british commander said on tuesday that the southern port town of umm qasr , home to iraq 's only deep water harbor , and a key point of access for supplies , is now " safe and open , " a claim disputed by iraqi vice president taha yassin ramadan . brigadier jim dutton , commander of the british royal marines ' 3 commando brigade , told reporters he hoped the first ship bringing aid to iraq would arrive within 48 hours . british prime minister tony blair said on tuesday that there were " huge stockpiles " of humanitarian aid waiting to be brought in from kuwait . " all that is holding us back at present is the threat of iraqi mines , " blair told a news conference . the british supply ship sir galahad , laden with vital civilian supplies , is anchored offshore and is awaiting clearance to enter the port .
talks stalled negotiations to reinstate the u.n. oil-for-food program are set to resume at the united nations in new york on tuesday following the postponement of a security council resolution to restructure the program for 45 days .
reuters news agency quoted diplomats from the permanent security council members russia , france and china , as well as non-permanent member syria , all of which are staunchly opposed to the war , as saying they were wary of language that would have the united nations coordinate efforts with u.s.-led troops and thereby legitimize their military action .
russia , reuters said , is adamant that existing contracts remain unchanged , while germany , which also opposes the war but has remained neutral in this particular dispute , has been making compromise proposals in its capacity as chair of the panel monitoring the program . " we 're demanding , or hoping , that the coordination of the humanitarian aid will be carried out through the united nations , " wolfgang jamann , coordinator for the nonprofit aktion deutschland hilft , told dw-tv .
" we do n't believe that the warring parties should be able to coordinate or control humanitarian aid . "
the british international development minister , clare short , said in parliament on monday , " if this program is not reinstated , it would be very difficult to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
we have to get it up and running very quickly . "
us accused of breaching geneva convention the french aid organization action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- has accused the united states of using hunger as a weapon , which would be a breach of the geneva convention .
it also accused the united nations of playing into the hands of the u.s.-led coalition .
the french doctor jean-christophe rufin , president of action contre la faim , said kofi annan suspended the oil-for-food program without discussion or consultation .
" that means the people in iraq will only get food again when they capitulate , " he told dw-radio .
" aid will only come after the soldiers .
food is therefore being used as a form of pressure .
people are being left to starve . " the oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to ease human suffering caused by economic sanctions imposed in august 1990 after iraq invaded kuwait .
it allows the iraqi authorities to use oil revenues to purchase food , medicine and civilian goods .
baghdad has ordered and paid for goods worth some € 8.4 billion -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- whose delivery has been put off by the war .
16 million dependent on program the united nations estimates that 60 percent of the iraqi population of 26 million people -lrb- almost 16 million -rrb- have to rely on the program for food .
the u.n. children 's fund , unicef , says 1.3 million iraqi children under five already suffer from malnutrition .
the un world food program says it believes some 2.1 million people could require food aid over the next four weeks , while the entire population would need help if the war dragged on any longer .
eu willing to help rebuild iraq meanwhile , the european union 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , has said the eu would be willing to play its part in the reconstruction of iraq after the war .
but , he said , it could only do this with a u.n. mandate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german international development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the german international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- , meanwhile , said on german breakfast tv on tuesday that those responsible for the war should also bear the brunt of reconstruction costs . describing the war as " scandalous " , she said the united states would have to pay the lion 's share of the costs , while any reconstruction program would have to take place under the auspices of the united nations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links unicef official website world food programme -lrb- wfp -rrb- official website .

aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .

" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .
conditions in the capital , baghdad , appear to be slightly less dramatic so far . huguenin told dw-tv that despite heavy aerial bombardment , electricity and waters services were still operating .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 25.03.2003 controversy over media coverage of prisoners of war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied soldiers take prisoners of war in iraq only days after the start war in iraq , prisoners of war have been taken on both sides .
tv pictures of frightened u.s. soldiers , captured by iraqi military have been broadcast - and have sparked worldwide debate . the iraqi state television and the arab station al-jazeera showed video footage of five captured american soldiers – four men and one woman – on sunday , four days after the beginning of the war in iraq .
the soldiers were interviewed by iraqi officials and appeared frightened .
the footage also included pictures of dead bodies dressed in american uniforms wounded in the head .
on monday , iraqi television showed another two american pilots , from a u.s. helicopter lost on monday during an attack by several of the aircraft on iraqi republican guards near the town of kerbala .
there is now a total number of seven soldiers listed as missing prisoners of war -lrb- pows -rrb- by the pentagon - a small number compared to the allegedly 2,000 iraqi prisoners of war captured by the allied forces .
nevertheless , the treatment of the american pows and the issue of media coverage has led to worldwide concerns and contempt international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush u.s president george w. bush and british premier tony blair sharply criticised the exposure of the american pows on television .
however , pictures of iraqi pows , captured by the allied forces have been previously shown on television networks all over the world .
in a speech to the un human rights commission on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to all warring parties to abide by international humanitarian laws .
iraq 's defence minister , sultan hashim ahmed , said iraq would " not harm the captured prisoners of war " .
he added : " it will treat them in accordance with the geneva convention on prisoners of war . "
the geneva conventions the international red cross is strongly opposed to showing any prisoners of war on television , stating article 13 of the geneva conventions : " prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated . -lrb- ... -rrb-
likewise , prisoners of war must at all times be protected , particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity .
but according to german red cross president knut ipsen , the media reports on the american soldiers captured in iraq do not violate the geneva conventions .
" what i have seen so far , namely 2 captured helicopter pilots and interviews with four u.s. soldiers does not violate the protection against public curiosity " said ipsen on tuesday in bochum .
he stated that pictures of pows are part of the media coverage of the war just like footage of injured people in hospitals .
both the united states and iraq have signed the geneva conventions that date back to 1949 .
after world war ii , a conference was held in geneva on the protection of war victims and international humanitarian law .
the international red cross controls if the parties at war abide by the geneva conventions , and has the right to access pows on both sides , making sure they are treated properly .
so far , the red cross expects no problems accessing pows in iraq .
personal tragedies shown on tv american audiences were spared the controversial footage at first or only got access to small snippets .
u.s. television networks mainly abided by the government 's request not to show the video footage .
short clips of the footage were first shown on cbs , later on cnn and nbc .
david westin , news editor of the tv channel abc said that pictures of dead american soldiers were n't " newsworthy " and that they had only been filmed to " create anger and disruption among the -lrb- american -rrb- people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph hudson indeed , anger and disruption was created among the families of the american pows .
anicita hudson , the mother of joseph hudson -lrb- photo -rrb- who was deployed to the gulf last month , told u.s. journalists that she had seen images of her son on a philippine channel to which she subcribes .
" i was shocked to see my son being interviewed " , she said , " all i did was scream and i started crying . "
bad memories come back british pilot john nichol knows first hand what it was like to be forced to appear on television after falling into enemy hands .
he was a pow in iraq during the last gulf war in 1991 .
" going on television was a humiliating , degrading , disgusting , despicable experience .
i did it under the threat of death , " he told bbc radio .
nichol thinks that iraqi assurances of treating the american pows according to the geneva conventions will bring little comfort to the victims .
" it must have been a horrific terrifying experience for the people there and their loved ones watching back home . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

tv pictures of frightened u.s. soldiers , captured by iraqi military have been broadcast - and have sparked worldwide debate . the iraqi state television and the arab station al-jazeera showed video footage of five captured american soldiers – four men and one woman – on sunday , four days after the beginning of the war in iraq .
the soldiers were interviewed by iraqi officials and appeared frightened .
the footage also included pictures of dead bodies dressed in american uniforms wounded in the head .
on monday , iraqi television showed another two american pilots , from a u.s. helicopter lost on monday during an attack by several of the aircraft on iraqi republican guards near the town of kerbala .
there is now a total number of seven soldiers listed as missing prisoners of war -lrb- pows -rrb- by the pentagon - a small number compared to the allegedly 2,000 iraqi prisoners of war captured by the allied forces .
nevertheless , the treatment of the american pows and the issue of media coverage has led to worldwide concerns and contempt international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush u.s president george w. bush and british premier tony blair sharply criticised the exposure of the american pows on television .
however , pictures of iraqi pows , captured by the allied forces have been previously shown on television networks all over the world .
in a speech to the un human rights commission on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer appealed to all warring parties to abide by international humanitarian laws .
iraq 's defence minister , sultan hashim ahmed , said iraq would " not harm the captured prisoners of war " .
he added : " it will treat them in accordance with the geneva convention on prisoners of war . "
the geneva conventions the international red cross is strongly opposed to showing any prisoners of war on television , stating article 13 of the geneva conventions : " prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated . -lrb- ... -rrb-
likewise , prisoners of war must at all times be protected , particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity .
but according to german red cross president knut ipsen , the media reports on the american soldiers captured in iraq do not violate the geneva conventions .
" what i have seen so far , namely 2 captured helicopter pilots and interviews with four u.s. soldiers does not violate the protection against public curiosity " said ipsen on tuesday in bochum .
he stated that pictures of pows are part of the media coverage of the war just like footage of injured people in hospitals .
both the united states and iraq have signed the geneva conventions that date back to 1949 .
after world war ii , a conference was held in geneva on the protection of war victims and international humanitarian law .
the international red cross controls if the parties at war abide by the geneva conventions , and has the right to access pows on both sides , making sure they are treated properly .
so far , the red cross expects no problems accessing pows in iraq .
personal tragedies shown on tv american audiences were spared the controversial footage at first or only got access to small snippets .
u.s. television networks mainly abided by the government 's request not to show the video footage .
short clips of the footage were first shown on cbs , later on cnn and nbc .
david westin , news editor of the tv channel abc said that pictures of dead american soldiers were n't " newsworthy " and that they had only been filmed to " create anger and disruption among the -lrb- american -rrb- people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph hudson indeed , anger and disruption was created among the families of the american pows .
anicita hudson , the mother of joseph hudson -lrb- photo -rrb- who was deployed to the gulf last month , told u.s. journalists that she had seen images of her son on a philippine channel to which she subcribes .
" i was shocked to see my son being interviewed " , she said , " all i did was scream and i started crying . "
bad memories come back british pilot john nichol knows first hand what it was like to be forced to appear on television after falling into enemy hands .
he was a pow in iraq during the last gulf war in 1991 .
" going on television was a humiliating , degrading , disgusting , despicable experience .
i did it under the threat of death , " he told bbc radio .
nichol thinks that iraqi assurances of treating the american pows according to the geneva conventions will bring little comfort to the victims .

as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy . in a report published by the european institute for tourism -lrb- eti -rrb- on monday , 41 percent of the german population said it feared a terrorist attack on holiday .
so it is perhaps not surprising that almost a third of germans say they would sooner stay at home this year than run the risk of taking a vacation .
in the past three months , the number of germans afraid to travel rose by more than ten percent - a figure likely to climb with the onset of war in iraq .
but the war itself isn ’ t unsettling would-be travelers as much as a deep-seated concern that heading abroad might make them a target for terrorists . attacks in djerba , tunisia and bali , indonesia over the past year claimed the lives of more than 20 german tourists .
the eti believes this fear , which half of german citizens share , is having the greatest influence on travelers as they make their summer holiday plans .
with a high standard of living and an average six weeks annual paid leave , germans are some of the world ’ s biggest globetrotters .
but even those who say conflict and terrorism will not get in the way of their annual sojourn in the sunshine are being more selective about their vacation destination this year .
over 80 percent said they would not visit turkey and egypt during a war .
results for other top german holiday destinations including tunisia , morocco and the united states were not far behind .
almost half said they would keep their distance from great britain throughout the crisis .
package tour operators hardest hit already suffering in the wake of the september 11th terrorist attacks in the united states , the travel industry has had to become even more flexible with the outbreak of war in iraq .
hardest hit have been the large companies , such as package tour operators tui and thomas cook , which buy holidays in bulk to sell to sun-seeking customers far in advance .
with global uncertainty keeping people from making early reservations this year , companies are now slashing prices to catch the imagination of still undecided travelers .
some travel agents have also begun offering apprehensive passengers intending to travel to countries close to the fighting an option to rebook at no additional cost .
but the association for german travel agencies and tour companies -lrb- drv -rrb- said there was no guarantee that passengers could be able to back out of vacation plans without incurring fees .
" as long as the foreign ministry does not issue a travel warning , travel agents are not obliged to cover the costs of cancellation as a result of the war in iraq , " said drv spokeswoman sybille zeuch .
with many germans holding off making vacation plans to see how the situation in iraq develops , last-minute travel operators are hoping to gain where the package tour groups stand to loose .
by one estimate , some 12 million germans will opt for spur-of-the moment vacations this year , with companies such as l 'tur or 5 vor flug .

despite germany ’ s strong opposition to the war , 33 percent of germans still fear terrorism on their own soil , according to the european institute for tourism report .
but eti manager bert hallerbach believes the conflict overseas opens up a great opportunity for germany ’ s domestic tourist industry . “ it ’ s a huge chance for regions in the countryside where there ’ s a small likelihood for attacks , ” said hallerbach .
and 75 percent of those surveyed by eti said that germany has become a genuine alternative vacation destination , with focus on tradition hot spots on the coasts along the north and baltic seas and the alpine region .

aid agencies are warning that a humanitarian crisis could unfold in iraq if emergency supplies are not brought in soon .
a french aid organization has accused the united states of using food as a weapon . fears of a humanitarian crisis in iraq are intensifying as u.s.-led troops meet stiff resistance in the south of the country , blocking supplies of much-needed aid .
negotiations to restart the u.n. oil-for-food program , which was suspended when u.n. staff members were withdrawn from iraq ahead of the u.s.-led war , have been stymied by disagreements between security council members .
situation critical in basra the situation is especially critical in the southern city of basra , where fierce fighting has held up u.s. and british troops .
supplies of drinking water have been reduced to less than half their normal levels after power outages at treatment plants , caused by massive ground and air attacks .
roland huguenin , a spokesman for the international committee of the red cross in baghdad , told dw-tv on tuesday that basra is now in its fourth day of water and power shortages .
he said icrc engineers were ready to go in as soon as they are given access .
basra is home to two million people and temperatures there can reach up to 40 degrees celcius -lrb- 104 fahrenheit -rrb- .
annan calls for urgent measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan in new york on monday , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said he believed urgent measures were required to restore power and water to the population .
" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .
conditions in the capital , baghdad , appear to be slightly less dramatic so far . huguenin told dw-tv that despite heavy aerial bombardment , electricity and waters services were still operating .
key port now under control a british commander said on tuesday that the southern port town of umm qasr , home to iraq 's only deep water harbor , and a key point of access for supplies , is now " safe and open , " a claim disputed by iraqi vice president taha yassin ramadan . brigadier jim dutton , commander of the british royal marines ' 3 commando brigade , told reporters he hoped the first ship bringing aid to iraq would arrive within 48 hours . british prime minister tony blair said on tuesday that there were " huge stockpiles " of humanitarian aid waiting to be brought in from kuwait . " all that is holding us back at present is the threat of iraqi mines , " blair told a news conference . the british supply ship sir galahad , laden with vital civilian supplies , is anchored offshore and is awaiting clearance to enter the port .
talks stalled negotiations to reinstate the u.n. oil-for-food program are set to resume at the united nations in new york on tuesday following the postponement of a security council resolution to restructure the program for 45 days .
reuters news agency quoted diplomats from the permanent security council members russia , france and china , as well as non-permanent member syria , all of which are staunchly opposed to the war , as saying they were wary of language that would have the united nations coordinate efforts with u.s.-led troops and thereby legitimize their military action .
russia , reuters said , is adamant that existing contracts remain unchanged , while germany , which also opposes the war but has remained neutral in this particular dispute , has been making compromise proposals in its capacity as chair of the panel monitoring the program . " we 're demanding , or hoping , that the coordination of the humanitarian aid will be carried out through the united nations , " wolfgang jamann , coordinator for the nonprofit aktion deutschland hilft , told dw-tv .
" we do n't believe that the warring parties should be able to coordinate or control humanitarian aid . "
the british international development minister , clare short , said in parliament on monday , " if this program is not reinstated , it would be very difficult to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
we have to get it up and running very quickly . "
us accused of breaching geneva convention the french aid organization action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- has accused the united states of using hunger as a weapon , which would be a breach of the geneva convention .
it also accused the united nations of playing into the hands of the u.s.-led coalition .
the french doctor jean-christophe rufin , president of action contre la faim , said kofi annan suspended the oil-for-food program without discussion or consultation .
" that means the people in iraq will only get food again when they capitulate , " he told dw-radio .
" aid will only come after the soldiers .
food is therefore being used as a form of pressure .
people are being left to starve . " the oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to ease human suffering caused by economic sanctions imposed in august 1990 after iraq invaded kuwait .
it allows the iraqi authorities to use oil revenues to purchase food , medicine and civilian goods .
baghdad has ordered and paid for goods worth some € 8.4 billion -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- whose delivery has been put off by the war .
16 million dependent on program the united nations estimates that 60 percent of the iraqi population of 26 million people -lrb- almost 16 million -rrb- have to rely on the program for food .
the u.n. children 's fund , unicef , says 1.3 million iraqi children under five already suffer from malnutrition .
the un world food program says it believes some 2.1 million people could require food aid over the next four weeks , while the entire population would need help if the war dragged on any longer .
eu willing to help rebuild iraq meanwhile , the european union 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , has said the eu would be willing to play its part in the reconstruction of iraq after the war .
but , he said , it could only do this with a u.n. mandate .

annan calls for urgent measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. secretary general kofi annan in new york on monday , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- said he believed urgent measures were required to restore power and water to the population .
" a city of that size can not afford to go without electricity or water for long .
aside from the water aspect , you can imagine what it does for sanitation , " he said .
concerns that conditions for the civilian population could worsen were heightened on tuesday when british defense officials said they had no intention of sending troops into the city , and preferred to view it as a politically significant target .
if coalition forces do not control the town , it is likely to remain unsafe for aid organizations to enter .
a british army spokesman , colonel chris vernon , said british troops were " seizing fleeting opportunities " on the thinly populated outskirts of basra to hit iraqi tanks and artillery .
" we 're picking away at it piece by piece but on our terms and where we see critical opportunities , " he said .
conditions in the capital , baghdad , appear to be slightly less dramatic so far . huguenin told dw-tv that despite heavy aerial bombardment , electricity and waters services were still operating .
key port now under control a british commander said on tuesday that the southern port town of umm qasr , home to iraq 's only deep water harbor , and a key point of access for supplies , is now " safe and open , " a claim disputed by iraqi vice president taha yassin ramadan . brigadier jim dutton , commander of the british royal marines ' 3 commando brigade , told reporters he hoped the first ship bringing aid to iraq would arrive within 48 hours . british prime minister tony blair said on tuesday that there were " huge stockpiles " of humanitarian aid waiting to be brought in from kuwait . " all that is holding us back at present is the threat of iraqi mines , " blair told a news conference . the british supply ship sir galahad , laden with vital civilian supplies , is anchored offshore and is awaiting clearance to enter the port .
talks stalled negotiations to reinstate the u.n. oil-for-food program are set to resume at the united nations in new york on tuesday following the postponement of a security council resolution to restructure the program for 45 days .
reuters news agency quoted diplomats from the permanent security council members russia , france and china , as well as non-permanent member syria , all of which are staunchly opposed to the war , as saying they were wary of language that would have the united nations coordinate efforts with u.s.-led troops and thereby legitimize their military action .
russia , reuters said , is adamant that existing contracts remain unchanged , while germany , which also opposes the war but has remained neutral in this particular dispute , has been making compromise proposals in its capacity as chair of the panel monitoring the program . " we 're demanding , or hoping , that the coordination of the humanitarian aid will be carried out through the united nations , " wolfgang jamann , coordinator for the nonprofit aktion deutschland hilft , told dw-tv .
" we do n't believe that the warring parties should be able to coordinate or control humanitarian aid . "
the british international development minister , clare short , said in parliament on monday , " if this program is not reinstated , it would be very difficult to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
we have to get it up and running very quickly . "
us accused of breaching geneva convention the french aid organization action contre la faim -lrb- action against hunger -rrb- has accused the united states of using hunger as a weapon , which would be a breach of the geneva convention .
it also accused the united nations of playing into the hands of the u.s.-led coalition .
the french doctor jean-christophe rufin , president of action contre la faim , said kofi annan suspended the oil-for-food program without discussion or consultation .
" that means the people in iraq will only get food again when they capitulate , " he told dw-radio .
" aid will only come after the soldiers .
food is therefore being used as a form of pressure .
people are being left to starve . " the oil-for-food program was launched in 1996 to ease human suffering caused by economic sanctions imposed in august 1990 after iraq invaded kuwait .
it allows the iraqi authorities to use oil revenues to purchase food , medicine and civilian goods .
baghdad has ordered and paid for goods worth some € 8.4 billion -lrb- $ 8.9 billion -rrb- whose delivery has been put off by the war .
16 million dependent on program the united nations estimates that 60 percent of the iraqi population of 26 million people -lrb- almost 16 million -rrb- have to rely on the program for food .
the u.n. children 's fund , unicef , says 1.3 million iraqi children under five already suffer from malnutrition .
the un world food program says it believes some 2.1 million people could require food aid over the next four weeks , while the entire population would need help if the war dragged on any longer .
eu willing to help rebuild iraq meanwhile , the european union 's foreign policy coordinator , javier solana , has said the eu would be willing to play its part in the reconstruction of iraq after the war .
but , he said , it could only do this with a u.n. mandate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german international development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul the german international development minister , heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- , meanwhile , said on german breakfast tv on tuesday that those responsible for the war should also bear the brunt of reconstruction costs . describing the war as " scandalous " , she said the united states would have to pay the lion 's share of the costs , while any reconstruction program would have to take place under the auspices of the united nations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links unicef official website world food programme -lrb- wfp -rrb- official website .

tv pictures of frightened u.s. soldiers , captured by iraqi military have been broadcast - and have sparked worldwide debate . the iraqi state television and the arab station al-jazeera showed video footage of five captured american soldiers – four men and one woman – on sunday , four days after the beginning of the war in iraq .
the soldiers were interviewed by iraqi officials and appeared frightened .
the footage also included pictures of dead bodies dressed in american uniforms wounded in the head .
on monday , iraqi television showed another two american pilots , from a u.s. helicopter lost on monday during an attack by several of the aircraft on iraqi republican guards near the town of kerbala .
there is now a total number of seven soldiers listed as missing prisoners of war -lrb- pows -rrb- by the pentagon - a small number compared to the allegedly 2,000 iraqi prisoners of war captured by the allied forces .
nevertheless , the treatment of the american pows and the issue of media coverage has led to worldwide concerns and contempt international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george bush u.s president george w. bush and british premier tony blair sharply criticised the exposure of the american pows on television .
however , pictures of iraqi pows , captured by the allied forces have been previously shown on television networks all over the world .

likewise , prisoners of war must at all times be protected , particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity .
but according to german red cross president knut ipsen , the media reports on the american soldiers captured in iraq do not violate the geneva conventions .
" what i have seen so far , namely 2 captured helicopter pilots and interviews with four u.s. soldiers does not violate the protection against public curiosity " said ipsen on tuesday in bochum .
he stated that pictures of pows are part of the media coverage of the war just like footage of injured people in hospitals .
both the united states and iraq have signed the geneva conventions that date back to 1949 .
after world war ii , a conference was held in geneva on the protection of war victims and international humanitarian law .

as u.s.-led military action against iraq continues , the german tourism industry is bracing itself for the effects of a nation turned travel shy . in a report published by the european institute for tourism -lrb- eti -rrb- on monday , 41 percent of the german population said it feared a terrorist attack on holiday .
so it is perhaps not surprising that almost a third of germans say they would sooner stay at home this year than run the risk of taking a vacation .
in the past three months , the number of germans afraid to travel rose by more than ten percent - a figure likely to climb with the onset of war in iraq .
but the war itself isn ’ t unsettling would-be travelers as much as a deep-seated concern that heading abroad might make them a target for terrorists . attacks in djerba , tunisia and bali , indonesia over the past year claimed the lives of more than 20 german tourists .
