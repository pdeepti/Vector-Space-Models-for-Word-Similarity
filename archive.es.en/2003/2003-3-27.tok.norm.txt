" " we know the world will not take heed of us until we put an end to our divisions .
until we stop relying on the european union for economic growth and the united states for security , " prodi said in a speech to the european parliament on wednesday . the nato accession of bulgaria , romania , slovenia , slovakia , estonia , latvia and lithuania - six of which are slated to join the eu in 2004 - has sparked renewed discussion in europe on an old topic : common security and foreign policy . in the past , talk of security policy has not been followed by the increase in defense budgets and inter-eu military cooperation needed to back such a plan .
different eu governments continue to work on similar projects , rather than pool their resources , say critics .
when multinational ventures are undertaken - as in the plan to purchase much-needed airbus military transport planes or assemble a european army - they are often delayed for months . more " european arrows " in nato in order to get access to absent military resources , the eu signed a cooperation agreement with nato in december .
now , european leaders are calling for more european contributions to nato 's military arsenal . chancellor gerhard schröder , who has said in recent days that germany should increase its defense budget , called for a " strengthening of nato through what you could call european arrows , " after a recent meeting with his colleagues . those new arrows are not likely to come from the new members , who have comparatively small defense budgets .
the new members do bring additional voices to a body that was recently wracked by internal disputes over nato defense equipment and planes deployed in turkey . the former communist countries , all of whom support the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , got caught in a recent transatlantic dispute between the pro and anti-war camps in america and europe .

10 , 2003 .
france and belgium angered washington on monday by blocking a nato plan to boost turkish defenses in case of a war with iraq .
there was no talk of dispute or crisis at the signing ceremony in brussels on wednesday .
the three-hour affair was attended by outgoing nato secretary general george robertson and the foreign ministers of the seven countries , some of whom alluded to nato 's possible role in the aftermath of the iraq war . " nato , together with other international organizations , mainly the united nations and the eu , has the potential to play a role in overcoming the difficulties in the aftermath of the war , " said romania 's foreign minister mircea geoana . lord robertson denied a report in the the wall street journal that nato could provide troops to a stabilization or peacekeeping force in iraq following saddam hussein 's removal from power .
according to the report , european nato members were pressuring france to support a key role for nato in post-war iraq .
france has emphasized it wants to see the u.n. in that role . " if somebody comes along and asks the alliance to do something in the aftermath of that conflict , then the nato council will consider , " robertson told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.03.2003 disputed arab tv network launches english web site großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the launch of its english web site , al-jazeera hopes to broaden its reach beyond the arab world .
a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .
with the start of the u.s. bombing campaign in afghanistan in autumn 2001 , traffic to its website in arabic leapt from an average 700,000 page impressions a day before the sept .
11 attacks , to 1.2 million page views a day in the immediate aftermath . although al-jazeera 's web site was entirely in arabic , the site mainly attracted american visitors : 40 percent of its visitors were from the u.s. , the station told the wall street journal .
an increasing number of english-speaking westerners , eager for an alternative perspective on the current conflict in iraq , are now expected to boost page impresssions on its new english web site , which focuses mainly on covering the iraq conflict . with headlines such as " basra facing humanitarian crisis " or " u.s. precision bomb destroys civilian bus " , the site aims to offer readers an intimate , raw view of the sufferings inflicted upon ordinary people in iraq as a result of the raging war . the site , which was launched on monday , is dedicated to special coverage on the current crisis in the middle east .
the channel prides itself on reporting on the middle east from a unique arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the western media . more freedoms unlike most western television networks operating in iraq that face heavy scrutiny and monitoring from the authorities , al-jazeera enjoys relative freedom in its reporting of the conflict . with eight camera crews operating outside the confines of the military , and only a few of its journalists taking part in the allied forces " embedded " program , which allows a limited number of reporters to accompany u.s.-led troops , the qatar-based channel is making the most of the special status endowed upon it by the iraqi authorities . the channel is also known to have the only operating television crew working in the key port city of basra , which has been under attack by coalition forces since the start of the war . banned from the trading floor of the ny stock exchange al-jazeera 's provocative reporting in the current conflict in iraq , in particular its broadcasting of captured american soldiers in iraq has sparked heated discussions in many western countries about how far the media can go while covering a war . in the past week , al-jazeera drew the ire of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld after broadcasting captured and frightened american prisoners of war by iraqi troops .
rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .
these include a picture of a child with its head spilt open , allegedly after a u.s.-led attack in basra . " al-jazeera has an editorial line and a way of presenting news that appeals to the arab public .
they watch it and they magnify the minor successes of the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- regime .
they tend to portray our efforts in a negative light , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with american radio . the channel 's blunt stance has already led to consequences for the network : on tuesday , al-jazeera was banned from the floor of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- .
the nyse stopped al-jazeera broadcasts , saying credentials were only for networks that provided " responsible " coverage .
al-jazeera was also denied a request to broadcast live from new york 's nasdaq exchange . the channel also reported that hackers had downed both its arab and newly-launched english language web site on tuesday and wednesday . al-jazeera spokesman , jihad ballout defended the broadcaster 's stance .
" there has to be a national effort to protect the freedom of the press even more , " he said .
" we appeal to the authorities to pay attention to this . " access to osama bin laden al-jazeera , launched in 1996 , first made its name during the war in afghanistan due to its exclusive access to the leader of the al-qaeda terrorist organization , osama bin laden , and the subsequent airing of the notorious terrorist 's recorded video messages . though respected for its brand of independent and outspoken reporting , the network has often been labeled as a " mouthpiece " of osama bin laden and u.s. officials in the past have voiced concern at what they see as its increasingly anti-western tone . the arabic channel first ran into controversy after it broadcast several interviews and speeches by senior iraqi officials , including the iraqi president saddam hussein in the first few days following the launch of operation " desert fox " by u.s. and british forces in iraq in december 1999 . on its web site , al-jazeera has been aiming for a broader view of the conflict as it reports on both the fighting in iraq as well as inflamed passions in the arab world as a result of it .
it also reports on alleged attacks on british consular buildings in beirut and ecuador by angry anti-war protestors this past week . protests from arab governments according to alan marmion , al-jazeera 's media consultant , the recent rise in interest for the television network -lrb- since the start of the war in iraq , its european subscribers have doubled -rrb- is not just due to the war . still , " the fact that we provide alternative images means people are coming to us rather than going to them -lrb- western media -rrb- , " he told the guardian newspaper . but this " alternative view " has in the past even provoked protests infrom arab governments like saudi arabia , kuwait and egypt .
these complaints have focused mainly on the fact that political dissidents regularly make an appearance on the channel . arab governments accuse al-jazeera of providing dissidents with a platform to criticise their various regimes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy over media coverage of prisoners of war only days after the start war in iraq , prisoners of war have been taken on both sides .
tv pictures of frightened u.s. soldiers , captured by iraqi military have been broadcast - and have sparked worldwide debate .

" " we know the world will not take heed of us until we put an end to our divisions .
until we stop relying on the european union for economic growth and the united states for security , " prodi said in a speech to the european parliament on wednesday . the nato accession of bulgaria , romania , slovenia , slovakia , estonia , latvia and lithuania - six of which are slated to join the eu in 2004 - has sparked renewed discussion in europe on an old topic : common security and foreign policy . in the past , talk of security policy has not been followed by the increase in defense budgets and inter-eu military cooperation needed to back such a plan .
different eu governments continue to work on similar projects , rather than pool their resources , say critics .
when multinational ventures are undertaken - as in the plan to purchase much-needed airbus military transport planes or assemble a european army - they are often delayed for months . more " european arrows " in nato in order to get access to absent military resources , the eu signed a cooperation agreement with nato in december .
now , european leaders are calling for more european contributions to nato 's military arsenal . chancellor gerhard schröder , who has said in recent days that germany should increase its defense budget , called for a " strengthening of nato through what you could call european arrows , " after a recent meeting with his colleagues . those new arrows are not likely to come from the new members , who have comparatively small defense budgets .
the new members do bring additional voices to a body that was recently wracked by internal disputes over nato defense equipment and planes deployed in turkey . the former communist countries , all of whom support the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , got caught in a recent transatlantic dispute between the pro and anti-war camps in america and europe .
president jacques chirac said their pro-war stances could harm their chances of joining the european union . nato in postwar iraq ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general lord robertson speaks during a media conference at nato headquarters in brussels , monday , feb .
10 , 2003 .
france and belgium angered washington on monday by blocking a nato plan to boost turkish defenses in case of a war with iraq .
there was no talk of dispute or crisis at the signing ceremony in brussels on wednesday .
the three-hour affair was attended by outgoing nato secretary general george robertson and the foreign ministers of the seven countries , some of whom alluded to nato 's possible role in the aftermath of the iraq war . " nato , together with other international organizations , mainly the united nations and the eu , has the potential to play a role in overcoming the difficulties in the aftermath of the war , " said romania 's foreign minister mircea geoana . lord robertson denied a report in the the wall street journal that nato could provide troops to a stabilization or peacekeeping force in iraq following saddam hussein 's removal from power .
according to the report , european nato members were pressuring france to support a key role for nato in post-war iraq .
france has emphasized it wants to see the u.n. in that role . " if somebody comes along and asks the alliance to do something in the aftermath of that conflict , then the nato council will consider , " robertson told reporters .

" " we know the world will not take heed of us until we put an end to our divisions .
until we stop relying on the european union for economic growth and the united states for security , " prodi said in a speech to the european parliament on wednesday . the nato accession of bulgaria , romania , slovenia , slovakia , estonia , latvia and lithuania - six of which are slated to join the eu in 2004 - has sparked renewed discussion in europe on an old topic : common security and foreign policy . in the past , talk of security policy has not been followed by the increase in defense budgets and inter-eu military cooperation needed to back such a plan .
different eu governments continue to work on similar projects , rather than pool their resources , say critics .
when multinational ventures are undertaken - as in the plan to purchase much-needed airbus military transport planes or assemble a european army - they are often delayed for months . more " european arrows " in nato in order to get access to absent military resources , the eu signed a cooperation agreement with nato in december .
now , european leaders are calling for more european contributions to nato 's military arsenal . chancellor gerhard schröder , who has said in recent days that germany should increase its defense budget , called for a " strengthening of nato through what you could call european arrows , " after a recent meeting with his colleagues . those new arrows are not likely to come from the new members , who have comparatively small defense budgets .
the new members do bring additional voices to a body that was recently wracked by internal disputes over nato defense equipment and planes deployed in turkey . the former communist countries , all of whom support the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , got caught in a recent transatlantic dispute between the pro and anti-war camps in america and europe .

10 , 2003 .
france and belgium angered washington on monday by blocking a nato plan to boost turkish defenses in case of a war with iraq .
there was no talk of dispute or crisis at the signing ceremony in brussels on wednesday .
the three-hour affair was attended by outgoing nato secretary general george robertson and the foreign ministers of the seven countries , some of whom alluded to nato 's possible role in the aftermath of the iraq war . " nato , together with other international organizations , mainly the united nations and the eu , has the potential to play a role in overcoming the difficulties in the aftermath of the war , " said romania 's foreign minister mircea geoana . lord robertson denied a report in the the wall street journal that nato could provide troops to a stabilization or peacekeeping force in iraq following saddam hussein 's removal from power .
according to the report , european nato members were pressuring france to support a key role for nato in post-war iraq .
france has emphasized it wants to see the u.n. in that role . " if somebody comes along and asks the alliance to do something in the aftermath of that conflict , then the nato council will consider , " robertson told reporters .

a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .
with the start of the u.s. bombing campaign in afghanistan in autumn 2001 , traffic to its website in arabic leapt from an average 700,000 page impressions a day before the sept .
11 attacks , to 1.2 million page views a day in the immediate aftermath . although al-jazeera 's web site was entirely in arabic , the site mainly attracted american visitors : 40 percent of its visitors were from the u.s. , the station told the wall street journal .
an increasing number of english-speaking westerners , eager for an alternative perspective on the current conflict in iraq , are now expected to boost page impresssions on its new english web site , which focuses mainly on covering the iraq conflict . with headlines such as " basra facing humanitarian crisis " or " u.s. precision bomb destroys civilian bus " , the site aims to offer readers an intimate , raw view of the sufferings inflicted upon ordinary people in iraq as a result of the raging war . the site , which was launched on monday , is dedicated to special coverage on the current crisis in the middle east .
the channel prides itself on reporting on the middle east from a unique arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the western media . more freedoms unlike most western television networks operating in iraq that face heavy scrutiny and monitoring from the authorities , al-jazeera enjoys relative freedom in its reporting of the conflict . with eight camera crews operating outside the confines of the military , and only a few of its journalists taking part in the allied forces " embedded " program , which allows a limited number of reporters to accompany u.s.-led troops , the qatar-based channel is making the most of the special status endowed upon it by the iraqi authorities . the channel is also known to have the only operating television crew working in the key port city of basra , which has been under attack by coalition forces since the start of the war . banned from the trading floor of the ny stock exchange al-jazeera 's provocative reporting in the current conflict in iraq , in particular its broadcasting of captured american soldiers in iraq has sparked heated discussions in many western countries about how far the media can go while covering a war . in the past week , al-jazeera drew the ire of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld after broadcasting captured and frightened american prisoners of war by iraqi troops .
rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .
these include a picture of a child with its head spilt open , allegedly after a u.s.-led attack in basra . " al-jazeera has an editorial line and a way of presenting news that appeals to the arab public .
they watch it and they magnify the minor successes of the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- regime .

the nyse stopped al-jazeera broadcasts , saying credentials were only for networks that provided " responsible " coverage .
al-jazeera was also denied a request to broadcast live from new york 's nasdaq exchange . the channel also reported that hackers had downed both its arab and newly-launched english language web site on tuesday and wednesday . al-jazeera spokesman , jihad ballout defended the broadcaster 's stance .
" there has to be a national effort to protect the freedom of the press even more , " he said .
" we appeal to the authorities to pay attention to this . " access to osama bin laden al-jazeera , launched in 1996 , first made its name during the war in afghanistan due to its exclusive access to the leader of the al-qaeda terrorist organization , osama bin laden , and the subsequent airing of the notorious terrorist 's recorded video messages . though respected for its brand of independent and outspoken reporting , the network has often been labeled as a " mouthpiece " of osama bin laden and u.s. officials in the past have voiced concern at what they see as its increasingly anti-western tone . the arabic channel first ran into controversy after it broadcast several interviews and speeches by senior iraqi officials , including the iraqi president saddam hussein in the first few days following the launch of operation " desert fox " by u.s. and british forces in iraq in december 1999 . on its web site , al-jazeera has been aiming for a broader view of the conflict as it reports on both the fighting in iraq as well as inflamed passions in the arab world as a result of it .
it also reports on alleged attacks on british consular buildings in beirut and ecuador by angry anti-war protestors this past week . protests from arab governments according to alan marmion , al-jazeera 's media consultant , the recent rise in interest for the television network -lrb- since the start of the war in iraq , its european subscribers have doubled -rrb- is not just due to the war . still , " the fact that we provide alternative images means people are coming to us rather than going to them -lrb- western media -rrb- , " he told the guardian newspaper . but this " alternative view " has in the past even provoked protests infrom arab governments like saudi arabia , kuwait and egypt .

a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .
with the start of the u.s. bombing campaign in afghanistan in autumn 2001 , traffic to its website in arabic leapt from an average 700,000 page impressions a day before the sept .
11 attacks , to 1.2 million page views a day in the immediate aftermath . although al-jazeera 's web site was entirely in arabic , the site mainly attracted american visitors : 40 percent of its visitors were from the u.s. , the station told the wall street journal .
an increasing number of english-speaking westerners , eager for an alternative perspective on the current conflict in iraq , are now expected to boost page impresssions on its new english web site , which focuses mainly on covering the iraq conflict . with headlines such as " basra facing humanitarian crisis " or " u.s. precision bomb destroys civilian bus " , the site aims to offer readers an intimate , raw view of the sufferings inflicted upon ordinary people in iraq as a result of the raging war . the site , which was launched on monday , is dedicated to special coverage on the current crisis in the middle east .
the channel prides itself on reporting on the middle east from a unique arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the western media . more freedoms unlike most western television networks operating in iraq that face heavy scrutiny and monitoring from the authorities , al-jazeera enjoys relative freedom in its reporting of the conflict . with eight camera crews operating outside the confines of the military , and only a few of its journalists taking part in the allied forces " embedded " program , which allows a limited number of reporters to accompany u.s.-led troops , the qatar-based channel is making the most of the special status endowed upon it by the iraqi authorities . the channel is also known to have the only operating television crew working in the key port city of basra , which has been under attack by coalition forces since the start of the war . banned from the trading floor of the ny stock exchange al-jazeera 's provocative reporting in the current conflict in iraq , in particular its broadcasting of captured american soldiers in iraq has sparked heated discussions in many western countries about how far the media can go while covering a war . in the past week , al-jazeera drew the ire of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld after broadcasting captured and frightened american prisoners of war by iraqi troops .
rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .
these include a picture of a child with its head spilt open , allegedly after a u.s.-led attack in basra . " al-jazeera has an editorial line and a way of presenting news that appeals to the arab public .
they watch it and they magnify the minor successes of the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- regime .
they tend to portray our efforts in a negative light , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with american radio . the channel 's blunt stance has already led to consequences for the network : on tuesday , al-jazeera was banned from the floor of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- .
the nyse stopped al-jazeera broadcasts , saying credentials were only for networks that provided " responsible " coverage .
al-jazeera was also denied a request to broadcast live from new york 's nasdaq exchange . the channel also reported that hackers had downed both its arab and newly-launched english language web site on tuesday and wednesday . al-jazeera spokesman , jihad ballout defended the broadcaster 's stance .
" there has to be a national effort to protect the freedom of the press even more , " he said .

a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .

rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .

a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .
with the start of the u.s. bombing campaign in afghanistan in autumn 2001 , traffic to its website in arabic leapt from an average 700,000 page impressions a day before the sept .
11 attacks , to 1.2 million page views a day in the immediate aftermath . although al-jazeera 's web site was entirely in arabic , the site mainly attracted american visitors : 40 percent of its visitors were from the u.s. , the station told the wall street journal .
an increasing number of english-speaking westerners , eager for an alternative perspective on the current conflict in iraq , are now expected to boost page impresssions on its new english web site , which focuses mainly on covering the iraq conflict . with headlines such as " basra facing humanitarian crisis " or " u.s. precision bomb destroys civilian bus " , the site aims to offer readers an intimate , raw view of the sufferings inflicted upon ordinary people in iraq as a result of the raging war . the site , which was launched on monday , is dedicated to special coverage on the current crisis in the middle east .
the channel prides itself on reporting on the middle east from a unique arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the western media . more freedoms unlike most western television networks operating in iraq that face heavy scrutiny and monitoring from the authorities , al-jazeera enjoys relative freedom in its reporting of the conflict . with eight camera crews operating outside the confines of the military , and only a few of its journalists taking part in the allied forces " embedded " program , which allows a limited number of reporters to accompany u.s.-led troops , the qatar-based channel is making the most of the special status endowed upon it by the iraqi authorities . the channel is also known to have the only operating television crew working in the key port city of basra , which has been under attack by coalition forces since the start of the war . banned from the trading floor of the ny stock exchange al-jazeera 's provocative reporting in the current conflict in iraq , in particular its broadcasting of captured american soldiers in iraq has sparked heated discussions in many western countries about how far the media can go while covering a war . in the past week , al-jazeera drew the ire of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld after broadcasting captured and frightened american prisoners of war by iraqi troops .
rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .
these include a picture of a child with its head spilt open , allegedly after a u.s.-led attack in basra . " al-jazeera has an editorial line and a way of presenting news that appeals to the arab public .
they watch it and they magnify the minor successes of the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- regime .
they tend to portray our efforts in a negative light , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with american radio . the channel 's blunt stance has already led to consequences for the network : on tuesday , al-jazeera was banned from the floor of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- .
the nyse stopped al-jazeera broadcasts , saying credentials were only for networks that provided " responsible " coverage .
al-jazeera was also denied a request to broadcast live from new york 's nasdaq exchange . the channel also reported that hackers had downed both its arab and newly-launched english language web site on tuesday and wednesday . al-jazeera spokesman , jihad ballout defended the broadcaster 's stance .
" there has to be a national effort to protect the freedom of the press even more , " he said .
" we appeal to the authorities to pay attention to this . " access to osama bin laden al-jazeera , launched in 1996 , first made its name during the war in afghanistan due to its exclusive access to the leader of the al-qaeda terrorist organization , osama bin laden , and the subsequent airing of the notorious terrorist 's recorded video messages . though respected for its brand of independent and outspoken reporting , the network has often been labeled as a " mouthpiece " of osama bin laden and u.s. officials in the past have voiced concern at what they see as its increasingly anti-western tone . the arabic channel first ran into controversy after it broadcast several interviews and speeches by senior iraqi officials , including the iraqi president saddam hussein in the first few days following the launch of operation " desert fox " by u.s. and british forces in iraq in december 1999 . on its web site , al-jazeera has been aiming for a broader view of the conflict as it reports on both the fighting in iraq as well as inflamed passions in the arab world as a result of it .
it also reports on alleged attacks on british consular buildings in beirut and ecuador by angry anti-war protestors this past week . protests from arab governments according to alan marmion , al-jazeera 's media consultant , the recent rise in interest for the television network -lrb- since the start of the war in iraq , its european subscribers have doubled -rrb- is not just due to the war . still , " the fact that we provide alternative images means people are coming to us rather than going to them -lrb- western media -rrb- , " he told the guardian newspaper . but this " alternative view " has in the past even provoked protests infrom arab governments like saudi arabia , kuwait and egypt .
these complaints have focused mainly on the fact that political dissidents regularly make an appearance on the channel . arab governments accuse al-jazeera of providing dissidents with a platform to criticise their various regimes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy over media coverage of prisoners of war only days after the start war in iraq , prisoners of war have been taken on both sides .

" " we know the world will not take heed of us until we put an end to our divisions .
until we stop relying on the european union for economic growth and the united states for security , " prodi said in a speech to the european parliament on wednesday . the nato accession of bulgaria , romania , slovenia , slovakia , estonia , latvia and lithuania - six of which are slated to join the eu in 2004 - has sparked renewed discussion in europe on an old topic : common security and foreign policy . in the past , talk of security policy has not been followed by the increase in defense budgets and inter-eu military cooperation needed to back such a plan .
different eu governments continue to work on similar projects , rather than pool their resources , say critics .
when multinational ventures are undertaken - as in the plan to purchase much-needed airbus military transport planes or assemble a european army - they are often delayed for months . more " european arrows " in nato in order to get access to absent military resources , the eu signed a cooperation agreement with nato in december .
now , european leaders are calling for more european contributions to nato 's military arsenal . chancellor gerhard schröder , who has said in recent days that germany should increase its defense budget , called for a " strengthening of nato through what you could call european arrows , " after a recent meeting with his colleagues . those new arrows are not likely to come from the new members , who have comparatively small defense budgets .
the new members do bring additional voices to a body that was recently wracked by internal disputes over nato defense equipment and planes deployed in turkey . the former communist countries , all of whom support the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , got caught in a recent transatlantic dispute between the pro and anti-war camps in america and europe .

10 , 2003 .
france and belgium angered washington on monday by blocking a nato plan to boost turkish defenses in case of a war with iraq .
there was no talk of dispute or crisis at the signing ceremony in brussels on wednesday .
the three-hour affair was attended by outgoing nato secretary general george robertson and the foreign ministers of the seven countries , some of whom alluded to nato 's possible role in the aftermath of the iraq war . " nato , together with other international organizations , mainly the united nations and the eu , has the potential to play a role in overcoming the difficulties in the aftermath of the war , " said romania 's foreign minister mircea geoana . lord robertson denied a report in the the wall street journal that nato could provide troops to a stabilization or peacekeeping force in iraq following saddam hussein 's removal from power .
according to the report , european nato members were pressuring france to support a key role for nato in post-war iraq .
france has emphasized it wants to see the u.n. in that role . " if somebody comes along and asks the alliance to do something in the aftermath of that conflict , then the nato council will consider , " robertson told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.03.2003 disputed arab tv network launches english web site großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the launch of its english web site , al-jazeera hopes to broaden its reach beyond the arab world .
a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .
with the start of the u.s. bombing campaign in afghanistan in autumn 2001 , traffic to its website in arabic leapt from an average 700,000 page impressions a day before the sept .
11 attacks , to 1.2 million page views a day in the immediate aftermath . although al-jazeera 's web site was entirely in arabic , the site mainly attracted american visitors : 40 percent of its visitors were from the u.s. , the station told the wall street journal .
an increasing number of english-speaking westerners , eager for an alternative perspective on the current conflict in iraq , are now expected to boost page impresssions on its new english web site , which focuses mainly on covering the iraq conflict . with headlines such as " basra facing humanitarian crisis " or " u.s. precision bomb destroys civilian bus " , the site aims to offer readers an intimate , raw view of the sufferings inflicted upon ordinary people in iraq as a result of the raging war . the site , which was launched on monday , is dedicated to special coverage on the current crisis in the middle east .
the channel prides itself on reporting on the middle east from a unique arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the western media . more freedoms unlike most western television networks operating in iraq that face heavy scrutiny and monitoring from the authorities , al-jazeera enjoys relative freedom in its reporting of the conflict . with eight camera crews operating outside the confines of the military , and only a few of its journalists taking part in the allied forces " embedded " program , which allows a limited number of reporters to accompany u.s.-led troops , the qatar-based channel is making the most of the special status endowed upon it by the iraqi authorities . the channel is also known to have the only operating television crew working in the key port city of basra , which has been under attack by coalition forces since the start of the war . banned from the trading floor of the ny stock exchange al-jazeera 's provocative reporting in the current conflict in iraq , in particular its broadcasting of captured american soldiers in iraq has sparked heated discussions in many western countries about how far the media can go while covering a war . in the past week , al-jazeera drew the ire of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld after broadcasting captured and frightened american prisoners of war by iraqi troops .
rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .
these include a picture of a child with its head spilt open , allegedly after a u.s.-led attack in basra . " al-jazeera has an editorial line and a way of presenting news that appeals to the arab public .
they watch it and they magnify the minor successes of the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- regime .
they tend to portray our efforts in a negative light , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with american radio . the channel 's blunt stance has already led to consequences for the network : on tuesday , al-jazeera was banned from the floor of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- .
the nyse stopped al-jazeera broadcasts , saying credentials were only for networks that provided " responsible " coverage .
al-jazeera was also denied a request to broadcast live from new york 's nasdaq exchange . the channel also reported that hackers had downed both its arab and newly-launched english language web site on tuesday and wednesday . al-jazeera spokesman , jihad ballout defended the broadcaster 's stance .
" there has to be a national effort to protect the freedom of the press even more , " he said .
" we appeal to the authorities to pay attention to this . " access to osama bin laden al-jazeera , launched in 1996 , first made its name during the war in afghanistan due to its exclusive access to the leader of the al-qaeda terrorist organization , osama bin laden , and the subsequent airing of the notorious terrorist 's recorded video messages . though respected for its brand of independent and outspoken reporting , the network has often been labeled as a " mouthpiece " of osama bin laden and u.s. officials in the past have voiced concern at what they see as its increasingly anti-western tone . the arabic channel first ran into controversy after it broadcast several interviews and speeches by senior iraqi officials , including the iraqi president saddam hussein in the first few days following the launch of operation " desert fox " by u.s. and british forces in iraq in december 1999 . on its web site , al-jazeera has been aiming for a broader view of the conflict as it reports on both the fighting in iraq as well as inflamed passions in the arab world as a result of it .
it also reports on alleged attacks on british consular buildings in beirut and ecuador by angry anti-war protestors this past week . protests from arab governments according to alan marmion , al-jazeera 's media consultant , the recent rise in interest for the television network -lrb- since the start of the war in iraq , its european subscribers have doubled -rrb- is not just due to the war . still , " the fact that we provide alternative images means people are coming to us rather than going to them -lrb- western media -rrb- , " he told the guardian newspaper . but this " alternative view " has in the past even provoked protests infrom arab governments like saudi arabia , kuwait and egypt .
these complaints have focused mainly on the fact that political dissidents regularly make an appearance on the channel . arab governments accuse al-jazeera of providing dissidents with a platform to criticise their various regimes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy over media coverage of prisoners of war only days after the start war in iraq , prisoners of war have been taken on both sides .

" " we know the world will not take heed of us until we put an end to our divisions .
until we stop relying on the european union for economic growth and the united states for security , " prodi said in a speech to the european parliament on wednesday . the nato accession of bulgaria , romania , slovenia , slovakia , estonia , latvia and lithuania - six of which are slated to join the eu in 2004 - has sparked renewed discussion in europe on an old topic : common security and foreign policy . in the past , talk of security policy has not been followed by the increase in defense budgets and inter-eu military cooperation needed to back such a plan .
different eu governments continue to work on similar projects , rather than pool their resources , say critics .
when multinational ventures are undertaken - as in the plan to purchase much-needed airbus military transport planes or assemble a european army - they are often delayed for months . more " european arrows " in nato in order to get access to absent military resources , the eu signed a cooperation agreement with nato in december .
now , european leaders are calling for more european contributions to nato 's military arsenal . chancellor gerhard schröder , who has said in recent days that germany should increase its defense budget , called for a " strengthening of nato through what you could call european arrows , " after a recent meeting with his colleagues . those new arrows are not likely to come from the new members , who have comparatively small defense budgets .
the new members do bring additional voices to a body that was recently wracked by internal disputes over nato defense equipment and planes deployed in turkey . the former communist countries , all of whom support the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , got caught in a recent transatlantic dispute between the pro and anti-war camps in america and europe .

france and belgium angered washington on monday by blocking a nato plan to boost turkish defenses in case of a war with iraq .
there was no talk of dispute or crisis at the signing ceremony in brussels on wednesday .
the three-hour affair was attended by outgoing nato secretary general george robertson and the foreign ministers of the seven countries , some of whom alluded to nato 's possible role in the aftermath of the iraq war . " nato , together with other international organizations , mainly the united nations and the eu , has the potential to play a role in overcoming the difficulties in the aftermath of the war , " said romania 's foreign minister mircea geoana . lord robertson denied a report in the the wall street journal that nato could provide troops to a stabilization or peacekeeping force in iraq following saddam hussein 's removal from power .
according to the report , european nato members were pressuring france to support a key role for nato in post-war iraq .
france has emphasized it wants to see the u.n. in that role . " if somebody comes along and asks the alliance to do something in the aftermath of that conflict , then the nato council will consider , " robertson told reporters .

a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .

an increasing number of english-speaking westerners , eager for an alternative perspective on the current conflict in iraq , are now expected to boost page impresssions on its new english web site , which focuses mainly on covering the iraq conflict . with headlines such as " basra facing humanitarian crisis " or " u.s. precision bomb destroys civilian bus " , the site aims to offer readers an intimate , raw view of the sufferings inflicted upon ordinary people in iraq as a result of the raging war . the site , which was launched on monday , is dedicated to special coverage on the current crisis in the middle east .
the channel prides itself on reporting on the middle east from a unique arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the western media . more freedoms unlike most western television networks operating in iraq that face heavy scrutiny and monitoring from the authorities , al-jazeera enjoys relative freedom in its reporting of the conflict . with eight camera crews operating outside the confines of the military , and only a few of its journalists taking part in the allied forces " embedded " program , which allows a limited number of reporters to accompany u.s.-led troops , the qatar-based channel is making the most of the special status endowed upon it by the iraqi authorities . the channel is also known to have the only operating television crew working in the key port city of basra , which has been under attack by coalition forces since the start of the war . banned from the trading floor of the ny stock exchange al-jazeera 's provocative reporting in the current conflict in iraq , in particular its broadcasting of captured american soldiers in iraq has sparked heated discussions in many western countries about how far the media can go while covering a war . in the past week , al-jazeera drew the ire of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld after broadcasting captured and frightened american prisoners of war by iraqi troops .
rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.03.2003 disputed arab tv network launches english web site großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the launch of its english web site , al-jazeera hopes to broaden its reach beyond the arab world .
a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .
with the start of the u.s. bombing campaign in afghanistan in autumn 2001 , traffic to its website in arabic leapt from an average 700,000 page impressions a day before the sept .
11 attacks , to 1.2 million page views a day in the immediate aftermath . although al-jazeera 's web site was entirely in arabic , the site mainly attracted american visitors : 40 percent of its visitors were from the u.s. , the station told the wall street journal .
an increasing number of english-speaking westerners , eager for an alternative perspective on the current conflict in iraq , are now expected to boost page impresssions on its new english web site , which focuses mainly on covering the iraq conflict . with headlines such as " basra facing humanitarian crisis " or " u.s. precision bomb destroys civilian bus " , the site aims to offer readers an intimate , raw view of the sufferings inflicted upon ordinary people in iraq as a result of the raging war . the site , which was launched on monday , is dedicated to special coverage on the current crisis in the middle east .
the channel prides itself on reporting on the middle east from a unique arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the western media . more freedoms unlike most western television networks operating in iraq that face heavy scrutiny and monitoring from the authorities , al-jazeera enjoys relative freedom in its reporting of the conflict . with eight camera crews operating outside the confines of the military , and only a few of its journalists taking part in the allied forces " embedded " program , which allows a limited number of reporters to accompany u.s.-led troops , the qatar-based channel is making the most of the special status endowed upon it by the iraqi authorities . the channel is also known to have the only operating television crew working in the key port city of basra , which has been under attack by coalition forces since the start of the war . banned from the trading floor of the ny stock exchange al-jazeera 's provocative reporting in the current conflict in iraq , in particular its broadcasting of captured american soldiers in iraq has sparked heated discussions in many western countries about how far the media can go while covering a war . in the past week , al-jazeera drew the ire of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld after broadcasting captured and frightened american prisoners of war by iraqi troops .
rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .
these include a picture of a child with its head spilt open , allegedly after a u.s.-led attack in basra . " al-jazeera has an editorial line and a way of presenting news that appeals to the arab public .
they watch it and they magnify the minor successes of the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- regime .
they tend to portray our efforts in a negative light , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with american radio . the channel 's blunt stance has already led to consequences for the network : on tuesday , al-jazeera was banned from the floor of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- .
the nyse stopped al-jazeera broadcasts , saying credentials were only for networks that provided " responsible " coverage .
al-jazeera was also denied a request to broadcast live from new york 's nasdaq exchange . the channel also reported that hackers had downed both its arab and newly-launched english language web site on tuesday and wednesday . al-jazeera spokesman , jihad ballout defended the broadcaster 's stance .
" there has to be a national effort to protect the freedom of the press even more , " he said .
" we appeal to the authorities to pay attention to this . " access to osama bin laden al-jazeera , launched in 1996 , first made its name during the war in afghanistan due to its exclusive access to the leader of the al-qaeda terrorist organization , osama bin laden , and the subsequent airing of the notorious terrorist 's recorded video messages . though respected for its brand of independent and outspoken reporting , the network has often been labeled as a " mouthpiece " of osama bin laden and u.s. officials in the past have voiced concern at what they see as its increasingly anti-western tone . the arabic channel first ran into controversy after it broadcast several interviews and speeches by senior iraqi officials , including the iraqi president saddam hussein in the first few days following the launch of operation " desert fox " by u.s. and british forces in iraq in december 1999 . on its web site , al-jazeera has been aiming for a broader view of the conflict as it reports on both the fighting in iraq as well as inflamed passions in the arab world as a result of it .
it also reports on alleged attacks on british consular buildings in beirut and ecuador by angry anti-war protestors this past week . protests from arab governments according to alan marmion , al-jazeera 's media consultant , the recent rise in interest for the television network -lrb- since the start of the war in iraq , its european subscribers have doubled -rrb- is not just due to the war . still , " the fact that we provide alternative images means people are coming to us rather than going to them -lrb- western media -rrb- , " he told the guardian newspaper . but this " alternative view " has in the past even provoked protests infrom arab governments like saudi arabia , kuwait and egypt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.03.2003 disputed arab tv network launches english web site großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the launch of its english web site , al-jazeera hopes to broaden its reach beyond the arab world .
a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .
with the start of the u.s. bombing campaign in afghanistan in autumn 2001 , traffic to its website in arabic leapt from an average 700,000 page impressions a day before the sept .
11 attacks , to 1.2 million page views a day in the immediate aftermath . although al-jazeera 's web site was entirely in arabic , the site mainly attracted american visitors : 40 percent of its visitors were from the u.s. , the station told the wall street journal .
an increasing number of english-speaking westerners , eager for an alternative perspective on the current conflict in iraq , are now expected to boost page impresssions on its new english web site , which focuses mainly on covering the iraq conflict . with headlines such as " basra facing humanitarian crisis " or " u.s. precision bomb destroys civilian bus " , the site aims to offer readers an intimate , raw view of the sufferings inflicted upon ordinary people in iraq as a result of the raging war . the site , which was launched on monday , is dedicated to special coverage on the current crisis in the middle east .
the channel prides itself on reporting on the middle east from a unique arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the western media . more freedoms unlike most western television networks operating in iraq that face heavy scrutiny and monitoring from the authorities , al-jazeera enjoys relative freedom in its reporting of the conflict . with eight camera crews operating outside the confines of the military , and only a few of its journalists taking part in the allied forces " embedded " program , which allows a limited number of reporters to accompany u.s.-led troops , the qatar-based channel is making the most of the special status endowed upon it by the iraqi authorities . the channel is also known to have the only operating television crew working in the key port city of basra , which has been under attack by coalition forces since the start of the war . banned from the trading floor of the ny stock exchange al-jazeera 's provocative reporting in the current conflict in iraq , in particular its broadcasting of captured american soldiers in iraq has sparked heated discussions in many western countries about how far the media can go while covering a war . in the past week , al-jazeera drew the ire of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld after broadcasting captured and frightened american prisoners of war by iraqi troops .
rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .
these include a picture of a child with its head spilt open , allegedly after a u.s.-led attack in basra . " al-jazeera has an editorial line and a way of presenting news that appeals to the arab public .
they watch it and they magnify the minor successes of the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- regime .
they tend to portray our efforts in a negative light , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with american radio . the channel 's blunt stance has already led to consequences for the network : on tuesday , al-jazeera was banned from the floor of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- .
the nyse stopped al-jazeera broadcasts , saying credentials were only for networks that provided " responsible " coverage .
al-jazeera was also denied a request to broadcast live from new york 's nasdaq exchange . the channel also reported that hackers had downed both its arab and newly-launched english language web site on tuesday and wednesday . al-jazeera spokesman , jihad ballout defended the broadcaster 's stance .
" there has to be a national effort to protect the freedom of the press even more , " he said .
" we appeal to the authorities to pay attention to this . " access to osama bin laden al-jazeera , launched in 1996 , first made its name during the war in afghanistan due to its exclusive access to the leader of the al-qaeda terrorist organization , osama bin laden , and the subsequent airing of the notorious terrorist 's recorded video messages . though respected for its brand of independent and outspoken reporting , the network has often been labeled as a " mouthpiece " of osama bin laden and u.s. officials in the past have voiced concern at what they see as its increasingly anti-western tone . the arabic channel first ran into controversy after it broadcast several interviews and speeches by senior iraqi officials , including the iraqi president saddam hussein in the first few days following the launch of operation " desert fox " by u.s. and british forces in iraq in december 1999 . on its web site , al-jazeera has been aiming for a broader view of the conflict as it reports on both the fighting in iraq as well as inflamed passions in the arab world as a result of it .
it also reports on alleged attacks on british consular buildings in beirut and ecuador by angry anti-war protestors this past week . protests from arab governments according to alan marmion , al-jazeera 's media consultant , the recent rise in interest for the television network -lrb- since the start of the war in iraq , its european subscribers have doubled -rrb- is not just due to the war . still , " the fact that we provide alternative images means people are coming to us rather than going to them -lrb- western media -rrb- , " he told the guardian newspaper . but this " alternative view " has in the past even provoked protests infrom arab governments like saudi arabia , kuwait and egypt .
these complaints have focused mainly on the fact that political dissidents regularly make an appearance on the channel . arab governments accuse al-jazeera of providing dissidents with a platform to criticise their various regimes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy over media coverage of prisoners of war only days after the start war in iraq , prisoners of war have been taken on both sides .
tv pictures of frightened u.s. soldiers , captured by iraqi military have been broadcast - and have sparked worldwide debate .

a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .
with the start of the u.s. bombing campaign in afghanistan in autumn 2001 , traffic to its website in arabic leapt from an average 700,000 page impressions a day before the sept .
11 attacks , to 1.2 million page views a day in the immediate aftermath . although al-jazeera 's web site was entirely in arabic , the site mainly attracted american visitors : 40 percent of its visitors were from the u.s. , the station told the wall street journal .
an increasing number of english-speaking westerners , eager for an alternative perspective on the current conflict in iraq , are now expected to boost page impresssions on its new english web site , which focuses mainly on covering the iraq conflict . with headlines such as " basra facing humanitarian crisis " or " u.s. precision bomb destroys civilian bus " , the site aims to offer readers an intimate , raw view of the sufferings inflicted upon ordinary people in iraq as a result of the raging war . the site , which was launched on monday , is dedicated to special coverage on the current crisis in the middle east .
the channel prides itself on reporting on the middle east from a unique arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the western media . more freedoms unlike most western television networks operating in iraq that face heavy scrutiny and monitoring from the authorities , al-jazeera enjoys relative freedom in its reporting of the conflict . with eight camera crews operating outside the confines of the military , and only a few of its journalists taking part in the allied forces " embedded " program , which allows a limited number of reporters to accompany u.s.-led troops , the qatar-based channel is making the most of the special status endowed upon it by the iraqi authorities . the channel is also known to have the only operating television crew working in the key port city of basra , which has been under attack by coalition forces since the start of the war . banned from the trading floor of the ny stock exchange al-jazeera 's provocative reporting in the current conflict in iraq , in particular its broadcasting of captured american soldiers in iraq has sparked heated discussions in many western countries about how far the media can go while covering a war . in the past week , al-jazeera drew the ire of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld after broadcasting captured and frightened american prisoners of war by iraqi troops .
rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .
these include a picture of a child with its head spilt open , allegedly after a u.s.-led attack in basra . " al-jazeera has an editorial line and a way of presenting news that appeals to the arab public .

the nyse stopped al-jazeera broadcasts , saying credentials were only for networks that provided " responsible " coverage .
al-jazeera was also denied a request to broadcast live from new york 's nasdaq exchange . the channel also reported that hackers had downed both its arab and newly-launched english language web site on tuesday and wednesday . al-jazeera spokesman , jihad ballout defended the broadcaster 's stance .
" there has to be a national effort to protect the freedom of the press even more , " he said .
" we appeal to the authorities to pay attention to this . " access to osama bin laden al-jazeera , launched in 1996 , first made its name during the war in afghanistan due to its exclusive access to the leader of the al-qaeda terrorist organization , osama bin laden , and the subsequent airing of the notorious terrorist 's recorded video messages . though respected for its brand of independent and outspoken reporting , the network has often been labeled as a " mouthpiece " of osama bin laden and u.s. officials in the past have voiced concern at what they see as its increasingly anti-western tone . the arabic channel first ran into controversy after it broadcast several interviews and speeches by senior iraqi officials , including the iraqi president saddam hussein in the first few days following the launch of operation " desert fox " by u.s. and british forces in iraq in december 1999 . on its web site , al-jazeera has been aiming for a broader view of the conflict as it reports on both the fighting in iraq as well as inflamed passions in the arab world as a result of it .
it also reports on alleged attacks on british consular buildings in beirut and ecuador by angry anti-war protestors this past week . protests from arab governments according to alan marmion , al-jazeera 's media consultant , the recent rise in interest for the television network -lrb- since the start of the war in iraq , its european subscribers have doubled -rrb- is not just due to the war . still , " the fact that we provide alternative images means people are coming to us rather than going to them -lrb- western media -rrb- , " he told the guardian newspaper . but this " alternative view " has in the past even provoked protests infrom arab governments like saudi arabia , kuwait and egypt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.03.2003 disputed arab tv network launches english web site großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the launch of its english web site , al-jazeera hopes to broaden its reach beyond the arab world .
a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .
with the start of the u.s. bombing campaign in afghanistan in autumn 2001 , traffic to its website in arabic leapt from an average 700,000 page impressions a day before the sept .
11 attacks , to 1.2 million page views a day in the immediate aftermath . although al-jazeera 's web site was entirely in arabic , the site mainly attracted american visitors : 40 percent of its visitors were from the u.s. , the station told the wall street journal .
an increasing number of english-speaking westerners , eager for an alternative perspective on the current conflict in iraq , are now expected to boost page impresssions on its new english web site , which focuses mainly on covering the iraq conflict . with headlines such as " basra facing humanitarian crisis " or " u.s. precision bomb destroys civilian bus " , the site aims to offer readers an intimate , raw view of the sufferings inflicted upon ordinary people in iraq as a result of the raging war . the site , which was launched on monday , is dedicated to special coverage on the current crisis in the middle east .
the channel prides itself on reporting on the middle east from a unique arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the western media . more freedoms unlike most western television networks operating in iraq that face heavy scrutiny and monitoring from the authorities , al-jazeera enjoys relative freedom in its reporting of the conflict . with eight camera crews operating outside the confines of the military , and only a few of its journalists taking part in the allied forces " embedded " program , which allows a limited number of reporters to accompany u.s.-led troops , the qatar-based channel is making the most of the special status endowed upon it by the iraqi authorities . the channel is also known to have the only operating television crew working in the key port city of basra , which has been under attack by coalition forces since the start of the war . banned from the trading floor of the ny stock exchange al-jazeera 's provocative reporting in the current conflict in iraq , in particular its broadcasting of captured american soldiers in iraq has sparked heated discussions in many western countries about how far the media can go while covering a war . in the past week , al-jazeera drew the ire of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld after broadcasting captured and frightened american prisoners of war by iraqi troops .
rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .
these include a picture of a child with its head spilt open , allegedly after a u.s.-led attack in basra . " al-jazeera has an editorial line and a way of presenting news that appeals to the arab public .
they watch it and they magnify the minor successes of the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- regime .
they tend to portray our efforts in a negative light , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with american radio . the channel 's blunt stance has already led to consequences for the network : on tuesday , al-jazeera was banned from the floor of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- .
the nyse stopped al-jazeera broadcasts , saying credentials were only for networks that provided " responsible " coverage .
al-jazeera was also denied a request to broadcast live from new york 's nasdaq exchange . the channel also reported that hackers had downed both its arab and newly-launched english language web site on tuesday and wednesday . al-jazeera spokesman , jihad ballout defended the broadcaster 's stance .
" there has to be a national effort to protect the freedom of the press even more , " he said .
" we appeal to the authorities to pay attention to this . " access to osama bin laden al-jazeera , launched in 1996 , first made its name during the war in afghanistan due to its exclusive access to the leader of the al-qaeda terrorist organization , osama bin laden , and the subsequent airing of the notorious terrorist 's recorded video messages . though respected for its brand of independent and outspoken reporting , the network has often been labeled as a " mouthpiece " of osama bin laden and u.s. officials in the past have voiced concern at what they see as its increasingly anti-western tone . the arabic channel first ran into controversy after it broadcast several interviews and speeches by senior iraqi officials , including the iraqi president saddam hussein in the first few days following the launch of operation " desert fox " by u.s. and british forces in iraq in december 1999 . on its web site , al-jazeera has been aiming for a broader view of the conflict as it reports on both the fighting in iraq as well as inflamed passions in the arab world as a result of it .
it also reports on alleged attacks on british consular buildings in beirut and ecuador by angry anti-war protestors this past week . protests from arab governments according to alan marmion , al-jazeera 's media consultant , the recent rise in interest for the television network -lrb- since the start of the war in iraq , its european subscribers have doubled -rrb- is not just due to the war . still , " the fact that we provide alternative images means people are coming to us rather than going to them -lrb- western media -rrb- , " he told the guardian newspaper . but this " alternative view " has in the past even provoked protests infrom arab governments like saudi arabia , kuwait and egypt .
these complaints have focused mainly on the fact that political dissidents regularly make an appearance on the channel . arab governments accuse al-jazeera of providing dissidents with a platform to criticise their various regimes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy over media coverage of prisoners of war only days after the start war in iraq , prisoners of war have been taken on both sides .
tv pictures of frightened u.s. soldiers , captured by iraqi military have been broadcast - and have sparked worldwide debate .

a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .

the channel prides itself on reporting on the middle east from a unique arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the western media . more freedoms unlike most western television networks operating in iraq that face heavy scrutiny and monitoring from the authorities , al-jazeera enjoys relative freedom in its reporting of the conflict . with eight camera crews operating outside the confines of the military , and only a few of its journalists taking part in the allied forces " embedded " program , which allows a limited number of reporters to accompany u.s.-led troops , the qatar-based channel is making the most of the special status endowed upon it by the iraqi authorities . the channel is also known to have the only operating television crew working in the key port city of basra , which has been under attack by coalition forces since the start of the war . banned from the trading floor of the ny stock exchange al-jazeera 's provocative reporting in the current conflict in iraq , in particular its broadcasting of captured american soldiers in iraq has sparked heated discussions in many western countries about how far the media can go while covering a war . in the past week , al-jazeera drew the ire of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld after broadcasting captured and frightened american prisoners of war by iraqi troops .
rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .

" " we know the world will not take heed of us until we put an end to our divisions .
until we stop relying on the european union for economic growth and the united states for security , " prodi said in a speech to the european parliament on wednesday . the nato accession of bulgaria , romania , slovenia , slovakia , estonia , latvia and lithuania - six of which are slated to join the eu in 2004 - has sparked renewed discussion in europe on an old topic : common security and foreign policy . in the past , talk of security policy has not been followed by the increase in defense budgets and inter-eu military cooperation needed to back such a plan .
different eu governments continue to work on similar projects , rather than pool their resources , say critics .
when multinational ventures are undertaken - as in the plan to purchase much-needed airbus military transport planes or assemble a european army - they are often delayed for months . more " european arrows " in nato in order to get access to absent military resources , the eu signed a cooperation agreement with nato in december .
now , european leaders are calling for more european contributions to nato 's military arsenal . chancellor gerhard schröder , who has said in recent days that germany should increase its defense budget , called for a " strengthening of nato through what you could call european arrows , " after a recent meeting with his colleagues . those new arrows are not likely to come from the new members , who have comparatively small defense budgets .
the new members do bring additional voices to a body that was recently wracked by internal disputes over nato defense equipment and planes deployed in turkey . the former communist countries , all of whom support the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , got caught in a recent transatlantic dispute between the pro and anti-war camps in america and europe .

10 , 2003 .
france and belgium angered washington on monday by blocking a nato plan to boost turkish defenses in case of a war with iraq .
there was no talk of dispute or crisis at the signing ceremony in brussels on wednesday .
the three-hour affair was attended by outgoing nato secretary general george robertson and the foreign ministers of the seven countries , some of whom alluded to nato 's possible role in the aftermath of the iraq war . " nato , together with other international organizations , mainly the united nations and the eu , has the potential to play a role in overcoming the difficulties in the aftermath of the war , " said romania 's foreign minister mircea geoana . lord robertson denied a report in the the wall street journal that nato could provide troops to a stabilization or peacekeeping force in iraq following saddam hussein 's removal from power .
according to the report , european nato members were pressuring france to support a key role for nato in post-war iraq .
france has emphasized it wants to see the u.n. in that role . " if somebody comes along and asks the alliance to do something in the aftermath of that conflict , then the nato council will consider , " robertson told reporters .

" " we know the world will not take heed of us until we put an end to our divisions .
until we stop relying on the european union for economic growth and the united states for security , " prodi said in a speech to the european parliament on wednesday . the nato accession of bulgaria , romania , slovenia , slovakia , estonia , latvia and lithuania - six of which are slated to join the eu in 2004 - has sparked renewed discussion in europe on an old topic : common security and foreign policy . in the past , talk of security policy has not been followed by the increase in defense budgets and inter-eu military cooperation needed to back such a plan .
different eu governments continue to work on similar projects , rather than pool their resources , say critics .
when multinational ventures are undertaken - as in the plan to purchase much-needed airbus military transport planes or assemble a european army - they are often delayed for months . more " european arrows " in nato in order to get access to absent military resources , the eu signed a cooperation agreement with nato in december .
now , european leaders are calling for more european contributions to nato 's military arsenal . chancellor gerhard schröder , who has said in recent days that germany should increase its defense budget , called for a " strengthening of nato through what you could call european arrows , " after a recent meeting with his colleagues . those new arrows are not likely to come from the new members , who have comparatively small defense budgets .
the new members do bring additional voices to a body that was recently wracked by internal disputes over nato defense equipment and planes deployed in turkey . the former communist countries , all of whom support the u.s.-led invasion of iraq , got caught in a recent transatlantic dispute between the pro and anti-war camps in america and europe .

france and belgium angered washington on monday by blocking a nato plan to boost turkish defenses in case of a war with iraq .
there was no talk of dispute or crisis at the signing ceremony in brussels on wednesday .
the three-hour affair was attended by outgoing nato secretary general george robertson and the foreign ministers of the seven countries , some of whom alluded to nato 's possible role in the aftermath of the iraq war . " nato , together with other international organizations , mainly the united nations and the eu , has the potential to play a role in overcoming the difficulties in the aftermath of the war , " said romania 's foreign minister mircea geoana . lord robertson denied a report in the the wall street journal that nato could provide troops to a stabilization or peacekeeping force in iraq following saddam hussein 's removal from power .
according to the report , european nato members were pressuring france to support a key role for nato in post-war iraq .
france has emphasized it wants to see the u.n. in that role . " if somebody comes along and asks the alliance to do something in the aftermath of that conflict , then the nato council will consider , " robertson told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.03.2003 disputed arab tv network launches english web site großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the launch of its english web site , al-jazeera hopes to broaden its reach beyond the arab world .
a day after it was launched , arab tv channel al-jazeera 's new english-language web site was downed by a hacker attack as the channel comes under fire for its controversial coverage of the iraq war . as viewers eager for news of the conflict in iraq turn to the internet to keep up with latest developments , for some web sites the flood of visitors is already proving too much .
one of these is arabic-language television satellite tv channel al-jazeera 's web site which was launched for the first time in english earlier this week . the increase in online traffic on al-jazeera 's site in the current conflict in iraq ties in with a similar increase during the war in afghanistan in 2001 .
with the start of the u.s. bombing campaign in afghanistan in autumn 2001 , traffic to its website in arabic leapt from an average 700,000 page impressions a day before the sept .
11 attacks , to 1.2 million page views a day in the immediate aftermath . although al-jazeera 's web site was entirely in arabic , the site mainly attracted american visitors : 40 percent of its visitors were from the u.s. , the station told the wall street journal .
an increasing number of english-speaking westerners , eager for an alternative perspective on the current conflict in iraq , are now expected to boost page impresssions on its new english web site , which focuses mainly on covering the iraq conflict . with headlines such as " basra facing humanitarian crisis " or " u.s. precision bomb destroys civilian bus " , the site aims to offer readers an intimate , raw view of the sufferings inflicted upon ordinary people in iraq as a result of the raging war . the site , which was launched on monday , is dedicated to special coverage on the current crisis in the middle east .
the channel prides itself on reporting on the middle east from a unique arab perspective while drawing on the professional experience of staff who have worked in the western media . more freedoms unlike most western television networks operating in iraq that face heavy scrutiny and monitoring from the authorities , al-jazeera enjoys relative freedom in its reporting of the conflict . with eight camera crews operating outside the confines of the military , and only a few of its journalists taking part in the allied forces " embedded " program , which allows a limited number of reporters to accompany u.s.-led troops , the qatar-based channel is making the most of the special status endowed upon it by the iraqi authorities . the channel is also known to have the only operating television crew working in the key port city of basra , which has been under attack by coalition forces since the start of the war . banned from the trading floor of the ny stock exchange al-jazeera 's provocative reporting in the current conflict in iraq , in particular its broadcasting of captured american soldiers in iraq has sparked heated discussions in many western countries about how far the media can go while covering a war . in the past week , al-jazeera drew the ire of u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld after broadcasting captured and frightened american prisoners of war by iraqi troops .
rumsfeld said the broadcast was a breach of the geneva convention . in addition , the channel has aired graphic images of blood and gore which other broadcasters have described too shocking and insensitive .
these include a picture of a child with its head spilt open , allegedly after a u.s.-led attack in basra . " al-jazeera has an editorial line and a way of presenting news that appeals to the arab public .
they watch it and they magnify the minor successes of the -lrb- iraqi -rrb- regime .
they tend to portray our efforts in a negative light , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview with american radio . the channel 's blunt stance has already led to consequences for the network : on tuesday , al-jazeera was banned from the floor of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- .
the nyse stopped al-jazeera broadcasts , saying credentials were only for networks that provided " responsible " coverage .
al-jazeera was also denied a request to broadcast live from new york 's nasdaq exchange . the channel also reported that hackers had downed both its arab and newly-launched english language web site on tuesday and wednesday . al-jazeera spokesman , jihad ballout defended the broadcaster 's stance .
" there has to be a national effort to protect the freedom of the press even more , " he said .
" we appeal to the authorities to pay attention to this . " access to osama bin laden al-jazeera , launched in 1996 , first made its name during the war in afghanistan due to its exclusive access to the leader of the al-qaeda terrorist organization , osama bin laden , and the subsequent airing of the notorious terrorist 's recorded video messages . though respected for its brand of independent and outspoken reporting , the network has often been labeled as a " mouthpiece " of osama bin laden and u.s. officials in the past have voiced concern at what they see as its increasingly anti-western tone . the arabic channel first ran into controversy after it broadcast several interviews and speeches by senior iraqi officials , including the iraqi president saddam hussein in the first few days following the launch of operation " desert fox " by u.s. and british forces in iraq in december 1999 . on its web site , al-jazeera has been aiming for a broader view of the conflict as it reports on both the fighting in iraq as well as inflamed passions in the arab world as a result of it .
it also reports on alleged attacks on british consular buildings in beirut and ecuador by angry anti-war protestors this past week . protests from arab governments according to alan marmion , al-jazeera 's media consultant , the recent rise in interest for the television network -lrb- since the start of the war in iraq , its european subscribers have doubled -rrb- is not just due to the war . still , " the fact that we provide alternative images means people are coming to us rather than going to them -lrb- western media -rrb- , " he told the guardian newspaper . but this " alternative view " has in the past even provoked protests infrom arab governments like saudi arabia , kuwait and egypt .
these complaints have focused mainly on the fact that political dissidents regularly make an appearance on the channel . arab governments accuse al-jazeera of providing dissidents with a platform to criticise their various regimes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy over media coverage of prisoners of war only days after the start war in iraq , prisoners of war have been taken on both sides .

turkish officials worry that the kurdish ethnic population there may seek to establish its own state after the iraq war , which could destabilize turkey , which has long clashed with the kurds . but in an attempt to quash fears that any turkish invasion would agitate ethnic tensions in iraqi-controlled kurdistan , turkey ’ s military commander , gen. hilmi ozkok , said on tuesday that it had “ no hidden agenda ” on iraq .
ozkok stressed that if turkish troops were deployed , it would only be to aid a humanitarian effort in the region .

interpol had issued a " red notice " regarding mr fujimori , which is not a warrant and can not compel any country to arrest or extradite a suspect , but does signify that the organisation is satisfied an arrest is justified .
mr fujimori , who holds japanese nationality , is living in exile in tokyo .
japan 's chief cabinet secretary , yasuo fukuda , said the interpol request would not be honoured , as it was not considered binding under the country 's laws .
" our domestic laws are not such that we will carry it out , " he said .
charges denied mr fujimori fled to japan in november 2000 amid a corruption and bribery scandal , taking japanese citizenship shortly afterwards .
he is seen as a hero in japan for his role in freeing hostages held at the japanese embassy in lima six years ago .
the charges against him relate to a 1991 massacre in lima in which an army " death squad " allegedly killed 15 people at a barbecue in a poor lima neighbourhood , and a 1992 massacre , also in lima , in which nine students and a professor with suspected leftist links were killed .
an arrest warrant was issued in peru in 2001 but the japanese constitution does not allow extradition of its citizens and the country has no extradition treaty with peru .
interpol 's red notice was later issued on request from peru , in connection with the outstanding warrant .
mr fujimori denies all the charges , claiming he is the target of political persecution .

the qatar-based channel showed the bodies of the soldiers lying in a dusty street and two prisoners in a room with iraqis .
the ministry of defence later confirmed the dead men were thought to be two soldiers who had gone missing during fighting around the town of al-zubayr , near the southern city of basra .
their families have been informed of the development .
a military spokesman said he was " shocked and appalled " by the broadcast and prime minister tony blair reacted with " horror " .

" we deplore the decision by al-jazeera to broadcast such material and call on them to desist immediately .
" all media must be aware of the limits of taste and decency . "

" just as they have no compunction about murdering their own people in their tens of thousands , their depravity knows no bounds in their treatment of prisoners of war . "
british forces were scrambled to attack a column of up to 120 iraqi armoured vehicles , including tanks , from basra towards the al-faw peninsula .
the bbc 's clive myrie said the marines - ill-equipped to deal with such a move - had called in tornado and harrier fighter jets from kuwait which had been attacking the vehicles " with some success " .
it was assumed the vehicles were staging a counter-attack on the british forces to recapture the peninsula , although they could have been fleeing amid a possible uprising in the city , he said .

the bbc 's frank gardner said investigations seemed to suggest there had been some sort of disturbance , probably involving food and lack of supplies , but it had been quickly quelled by the authorities .
british reporters with the uk troops said coalition forces continued to attack certain targets within the city .
humanitarian concerns are mounting because parts of basra 's population have no electricity or water .

royal marines from 42 commando deliver food parcels after an unexpectedly tough battle for iraq 's only deep sea port of umm qasr , the first major food aid shipments to iraq have now been delayed by the threat of mines .
the food aid - 500 tonnes of water , sugar and grain - is desperately needed by iraqi civilians .
but the british ship carrying it , the sir galahad , wo n't be able to dock at umm qasr until at least tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- because mines have been detected in its path .
the aid is a vital first step on the road to iraq 's reconstruction - a subject which tony blair and george bush will be discussing in their washington summit today so , how do you re-build iraq ?
the afghan example breakfast 's graham satchell looked at how reconstruction is progressing in afghanistan , just a year after american forces overthrew the hated taleban regime there .
what he found was a gap between promises and reality , when it comes to aid. click here to watch graham satchell 's report in full should the un get involved ?
we debated the issues with a former un under secretary general dame margaret anstee and oxfam 's paul mylrea .
" it 's essential that the un is there , " dame margaret told us .
" the un has an enormous wealth of experience in the field . "
anstee : the un is essential paul mylrea added : " the iraqis have not welcomed the troops with open arms .
" this is a country with very educated people such as doctors and engineers - they have to be involved .
that means we need something with international legitimacy .
" it will be tough to get this through the un but we have to do it . " click here to watch our debate in full on reconstructing iraq summit the future running of iraq will be high on the agenda when the prime minister tony blair meets president bush on thursday .
central to the discussions is the role the united nations will play in a post-war iraq .
the first humanitarian aid arrives in umm qasr un resolution britain is pushing for a new un resolution - it wants the security council to oversee a post saddam regime .
but the united states does not want the countries that did not back the war - france , germany and russia - to have a say in how the country is run .
it is widely thought that the us has an ' administration in waiting ' poised to take over the running of the country while us firms get on with the reconstruction work .
aid organisations if the un is n't involved in the process , then it is thought highly likely that many of the aid organisations will refuse to give their support and there is a real fear that iraq could be abandoned and left without the long term help needed to rebuild .
comparisons are made with afghanistan where reconstruction has not happened because aid agencies say money that was promised by the international community never arrived .
another alternative for iraq could be the resumption of the oil for food programme which would allow the country to sell some of its oil in order to buy food and other essential supplies .
cost of aid on tuesday president bush announced that nearly $ 75 bn would be set aside to fight the war , yet only $ 2.4bn has initially been allocated for rebuilding and ' early ' relief ; the long term cost will be considerably higher . watch / listen on this story should the un be involved in reconstruction ?

but it is unclear when the push towards the iraqi capital will be renewed , and it may be delayed several days at least .
any hopes that the iraqi authorities might have crumbled in the face of the americans ' rapid early advance and heavy initial air strikes seem to have evaporated .
at the pentagon , vice director of operations for the joint staff , major general stanley mcchrystal , said the continued skirmishing in the south had been fairly limited and had not put the us-led forces off their plan .
' partial ' success still , some pentagon officials have conceded that the resistance has been greater than expected , and that they were making adjustments .
the continued fighting has fuelled criticism from analysts and retired senior military officers that the initial us-led invasion force was too small and lacking sufficient firepower .
the " rolling start " of launching the attack while other forces continued to arrive has also been criticised .
part of the plan appears to have been to make up for the relative lack of numbers on the ground with scores of powerful apache attack helicopters .
but their initial assault appears to have been , at best , only a partial success .
and since then the weather has grounded this force .
' softening ' iraqi forces another missing element until now has been a significant northern front .
weather conditions have hampered coalition troops in southern iraq that is changing with the arrival of the first 1,000 troops of the 173rd airborne brigade , parachuted in to a northern iraqi airfield .
more troops and equipment will be airlifted in , including tanks .
this is still not the northern option that the pentagon would have preferred , as the forces are smaller and lighter than originally planned .
but at the very least they could " fix " iraqi forces in the north , and prevent them heading south to reinforce baghdad .
delaying a further push from the south will allow more time for the republican guard divisions around baghdad to be " softened up " from the air .
reinforcements but the iraqis may still choose to take the initiative .
the us-led forces will be hoping that a decisive engagement with the southern defences of baghdad will force the collapse of saddam hussein 's grip on power before they have to confront the issue of moving in to baghdad itself .
at the same time , reinforcements continue to flow .
the fourth infantry division , the force originally earmarked for the northern front through turkey , is to begin deploying to kuwait .
its equipment is already on the way from the eastern mediterranean , where it had been packed aboard ships awaiting a turkish decision .
it will be two or three weeks before that division is ready to join the fight .
but where exactly the campaign will be by then is not clear .

any hopes that the iraqi authorities might have crumbled in the face of the americans ' rapid early advance and heavy initial air strikes seem to have evaporated .
at the pentagon , vice director of operations for the joint staff , major general stanley mcchrystal , said the continued skirmishing in the south had been fairly limited and had not put the us-led forces off their plan .
' partial ' success still , some pentagon officials have conceded that the resistance has been greater than expected , and that they were making adjustments .
the continued fighting has fuelled criticism from analysts and retired senior military officers that the initial us-led invasion force was too small and lacking sufficient firepower .
the " rolling start " of launching the attack while other forces continued to arrive has also been criticised .
part of the plan appears to have been to make up for the relative lack of numbers on the ground with scores of powerful apache attack helicopters .
but their initial assault appears to have been , at best , only a partial success .
and since then the weather has grounded this force .
' softening ' iraqi forces another missing element until now has been a significant northern front .
weather conditions have hampered coalition troops in southern iraq that is changing with the arrival of the first 1,000 troops of the 173rd airborne brigade , parachuted in to a northern iraqi airfield .
more troops and equipment will be airlifted in , including tanks .
this is still not the northern option that the pentagon would have preferred , as the forces are smaller and lighter than originally planned .
but at the very least they could " fix " iraqi forces in the north , and prevent them heading south to reinforce baghdad .
delaying a further push from the south will allow more time for the republican guard divisions around baghdad to be " softened up " from the air .
reinforcements but the iraqis may still choose to take the initiative .
the us-led forces will be hoping that a decisive engagement with the southern defences of baghdad will force the collapse of saddam hussein 's grip on power before they have to confront the issue of moving in to baghdad itself .
at the same time , reinforcements continue to flow .
the fourth infantry division , the force originally earmarked for the northern front through turkey , is to begin deploying to kuwait .
its equipment is already on the way from the eastern mediterranean , where it had been packed aboard ships awaiting a turkish decision .
it will be two or three weeks before that division is ready to join the fight .

but it is unclear when the push towards the iraqi capital will be renewed , and it may be delayed several days at least .
any hopes that the iraqi authorities might have crumbled in the face of the americans ' rapid early advance and heavy initial air strikes seem to have evaporated .
at the pentagon , vice director of operations for the joint staff , major general stanley mcchrystal , said the continued skirmishing in the south had been fairly limited and had not put the us-led forces off their plan .
' partial ' success still , some pentagon officials have conceded that the resistance has been greater than expected , and that they were making adjustments .
the continued fighting has fuelled criticism from analysts and retired senior military officers that the initial us-led invasion force was too small and lacking sufficient firepower .
the " rolling start " of launching the attack while other forces continued to arrive has also been criticised .
part of the plan appears to have been to make up for the relative lack of numbers on the ground with scores of powerful apache attack helicopters .
but their initial assault appears to have been , at best , only a partial success .
and since then the weather has grounded this force .
' softening ' iraqi forces another missing element until now has been a significant northern front .
weather conditions have hampered coalition troops in southern iraq that is changing with the arrival of the first 1,000 troops of the 173rd airborne brigade , parachuted in to a northern iraqi airfield .
more troops and equipment will be airlifted in , including tanks .
this is still not the northern option that the pentagon would have preferred , as the forces are smaller and lighter than originally planned .
but at the very least they could " fix " iraqi forces in the north , and prevent them heading south to reinforce baghdad .
delaying a further push from the south will allow more time for the republican guard divisions around baghdad to be " softened up " from the air .
reinforcements but the iraqis may still choose to take the initiative .
the us-led forces will be hoping that a decisive engagement with the southern defences of baghdad will force the collapse of saddam hussein 's grip on power before they have to confront the issue of moving in to baghdad itself .
at the same time , reinforcements continue to flow .
the fourth infantry division , the force originally earmarked for the northern front through turkey , is to begin deploying to kuwait .
its equipment is already on the way from the eastern mediterranean , where it had been packed aboard ships awaiting a turkish decision .
it will be two or three weeks before that division is ready to join the fight .
but where exactly the campaign will be by then is not clear .

the event marked the 10th anniversary of his death .
mr livingstone was accompanied by stephen 's mother doreen in eltham , south-east london , where the 18-year-old was stabbed to death by a gang of white men on 22 april , 1993 .
no-one has been convicted of the murder .
the metropolitan police was accused of " institutional racism " in a report into its investigation of the teenager 's death .
five men were initially arrested but proceedings against two of them were discontinued by the crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- .
an inquest into stephen 's death ended in february 1997 , with the jury deciding the teenager had been " unlawfully killed in a completely unprovoked racist attack by five white youths " .
suspects acquitted stephen 's parents , neville and doreen lawrence , then took up a private prosecution against all five but the case against two of them was dropped at the committal stage .
three men - neil acourt , gary dobson and luke knight - went on trial at the old bailey but were formally acquitted in april 1996 .
acourt and david norris - another of the initial five suspects - were each jailed last year for 18 months for a racist attack on a black police officer .
the sentences were later reduced to 12 months on appeal .
the mayor 's visit was part of a day-long visit to south-east london .

" in a week there has been an enormous surge forward - but it has n't been as easy as everyone was predicting " sir tim told us .
predictions that us and british troops could by-pass iraqi towns and march on towards baghdad have failed to materialise .

the key question : should the un be involved in reconstruction - or will iraq remain under us control when the war is over ?
" we think that if we could get a un resoution on reconstruction that would be a good thing .
but the british and the americans are concerned about the role the french would play , " iain duncan smith told breakfast .
