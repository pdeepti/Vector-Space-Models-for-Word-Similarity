some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .
german schools have been slower to follow . three states ban advertising outright , but amid steadily shrinking school budgets most allow their schools to rent out ad space as long as it helps them to buy needed materials . " there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .
most teens receive an average monthly allowance of € 80 and spend liberally on clothes and mobile phones , according to a recent study by publishers axel springer and bauer verlag . that 's exactly why teenagers should n't receive more encouragement at school , say some . " there 's enough advertising already , " says susanne levin , a teacher at the falkschule .
" wherever they go , children are encouraged to spend money on things they do n't need , and it does n't need to happen at school too . " state school authorities agree . " fortunately , schools are still a place that can offer an escape from reality , at least in some areas , " said hans-rolf eifer , from the hesse school authority .
" schools can make students aware of negative developments , which i think should n't be taking place everywhere in the first place .

as yet another shipload of illegal migrants is discovered off southern italy , the pressure increases on eu states to resolve the migration issue . at least 13 people were found dead in a small wooden boat adrift in the mediterranean between north africa and italy , and many more are believed to have died during a strenuous three-week odyssey to europe ’ s shores .
on monday a spokesperson for the italian coastguard , which fished out the 40-foot vessel southeast of the island of lampedusa , said that the pile of decaying corpses and severely emaciated survivors was like something straight out of dante ’ s inferno .
captain stefano valfre , who first sighted the ship drifting near sicily , told reporters that the 15 surviving refugees had said that as many as 100 people had originally boarded the boat , and that they had thrown the bodies of the dead overboard , until they had become too weak to do even that .
the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .
although italy has been most recentlyaeffected by the ceaseless wave of refugees lapping at its door , the problem is one that all of europe faces .
europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "
a non-quantifiable figure bodies such as the international center for migration policy development -lrb- icmpd -rrb- estimate that the population of europe is rising by up to one million a year , including illegal migration , but stress that the phenomenon is not statistically quantifiable .
each year , hundreds of thousands slip through europe 's borders and wash up its shores , unobserved and uncounted .
and as the eu expands eastwards and its borders touch those of states such as the ukraine and russia , where human trafficking is already a known problem , many in the european commission fear europe will be overwhelmed with even more illegal migrants .
" fortress europe " with seemingly more urgency than ever , the interior ministers from france , germany , britain , italy and spain forged ahead with their plans for toughening up their border security .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy proposed the creation of a " european security zone " for protection against illegal immigration via the mediterranean sea , which would be patrolled both along the european and african coast .
the five ministers discussed a " three plus three " cooperation deal involving france , italy and spain sponsoring efforts in algeria , morocco and tunisia to halt the exodus of clandestine migrants .
the " big five " also announced they had agreed to boost police cooperation , reforming the collective eu police agency europol , clamping down on gangs dealing in human trafficking , and putting microchips on visas for the eu 's schengen area that would include fingerprints and face-scans in digital form .
nicolas sarkozy rejected suggestions the eu was being turned into " fortress europe , " reducing the numbers arriving by making migrants ' chances of entry less and less likely .

for now , the amsterdam treaty , which came into force on may 1 , 1999 , provides the legal basis for a common european union immigration policy .
the deadline for a new common asylum and migration policy is set for may 2004 .
but with eu states still wrangling over the border management agency which would coordinate existing centers responsible for border control and the migration issue still a sticking point in the first european constitution , it seems that when it comes to migration , most countries are unwilling to hand over the decision-making to brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 22.10.2003 compromise or bust for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's first constitution is still just a draft on paper .
european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared .

european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .
only when the numbers of exhibitors and visitors to the big computer fairs start rising again will the first tentative signals of growth be cause for celebration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .
only when the numbers of exhibitors and visitors to the big computer fairs start rising again will the first tentative signals of growth be cause for celebration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .

a day after the un passed a resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a security fence , israel 's foreign minister made his first visit to germany and defended his country 's right to security . israeli foreign minister silvan shalom began a three-day visit to germany wednesday with the official purpose of drawing attention to and condemning the rise of anti-semitism in europe and around the world .
but as israeli government officials vowed to press-on with efforts to build a controversial security fence in palestinian territory despite a day-old un resolution - sponsored by the european union - calling on israel to cease and desist , rising tensions in the middle east overshadowed shalom 's visit . speaking during a visit to a former concentration camp north of berlin , the israeli foreign minister defended his government 's hardened stance , stating that , " it is our right to defend our land and our citizens , a right no one can take away from us . " making the rounds in berlin the foreign minister began his visit to germany 's capitol on wednesday by meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder - details of their conversation were not released to the press .
he then travelled to a former concentration camp in sachsenhausen , just north of berlin . laying flowers on the grounds where thousands of jews were killed by the nazis , shalom used the opportunity to warn about the growing threat of anti-semitism in europe and the arab world .
" today , less than 60 years after the holocaust , we are witnesses to a re-sprouting of anti-semitism in europe .
this sprays its poison not just against its traditional goal , jews , but the new anti-semitism is also directed against israel , " he told the crowd . attacks against jews have been on the rise in germany .
last month , police uncovered a plot by several far-right groups to bomb a jewish sight in munich . later wednesday night , shalom met with the german foreign minister joschka fischer , but the two discussed more than the problems of anti-semitism and touched on the mounting crisis in the middle east .
they discussed the eu 's role in dealing with iran , and germany 's role as intermediary in an upcoming hostage exchange between israel and hezbollah militants . the future of middle east peace hangs in the balance and all must work towards that goal .
a spokesman for fischer reiterated the german position : " the implementation of the ' road map ' is without an alternative . " defiant israel builds fence , despite un demands shalom arrived in germany a day after the un general assembly passed a tough new resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a controversial security fence , which is located within palestinian territory . the resolution was sponsored by the european union , and all 15 members , including germany , voted to support it in the general assembly .
the vote passed with 144 in favor and 4 against , including the united states and israel .
-lrb- twelve countries abstained . -rrb- the eu agreed to sponsor the resolution after an earlier version proposed by arab governments was toned down .
the compromise text calls on israel to " stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the occupied palestinian territory , " which it says is " in contradiction to relevant provisions of international law . "
the arab government 's resolution proposed turning the matter over to the international court of justice to issue an advisory opinion , which the eu member states objected to . despite the un 's censure , israeli officials , the foreign minister included , say their government wo n't reverse course .
shalom made this position known during his visit to berlin , and back home , israel 's deputy prime minister , ehud olmert , stated the same thing more explicitly .
" the fence will continue being built and we will go on taking care of the security of israel 's citizens , " olmert told israel radio . how can israel continue to go against the will of the majority of the international community , including the will of the eu ?
" israel can and will ignore the latest un resolution for one simple reason : israel can be sure of the usa 's support , " avi primor , the former israeli ambassador to germany told deutsche welle .

auto giant daimlerchrysler may have posted lousy figures for the third quarter this week , but as 2003 comes to a close it looks like this year will offer the german car industry more than just gloom and doom . with operating profit plummeting 19 percent and sales dropping five percent in the third quarter , things look pretty grim for german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler .

daimlerchrysler actually managed to squeeze out a tiny profit at chrysler in the third quarter by cutting costs , but unfortunately the u.s. market remains a vicious place with rebates and other sales incentives . the stuttgart-based daimler-benz has been plagued with problems at chrysler ever since it took over america ’ s number three carmaker in 1998 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 22.10.2003 compromise or bust for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's first constitution is still just a draft on paper .
european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared .

but with countries still split over the draft , much work remains before the conference 's december deadline .

auto giant daimlerchrysler may have posted lousy figures for the third quarter this week , but as 2003 comes to a close it looks like this year will offer the german car industry more than just gloom and doom . with operating profit plummeting 19 percent and sales dropping five percent in the third quarter , things look pretty grim for german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler .
after posting results including a massive net € 1.65 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- loss on tuesday , the world ’ s fifth largest auto company punished with a sinking share price and downgrades galore . as equity analysts ratcheted down their stock price targets for the year , rating agency standard & poor ’ s cut daimlerchrysler ’ s credit rating from bbb + to bbb with a negative outlook , citing how the company continues to be hobbled by its troubled american unit chrysler . although the firm ’ s german mercedes luxury brand continues to sell well , most analysts believe daimlerchrysler can only flourish if it manages to turn things around at the american unit .
daimlerchrysler actually managed to squeeze out a tiny profit at chrysler in the third quarter by cutting costs , but unfortunately the u.s. market remains a vicious place with rebates and other sales incentives . the stuttgart-based daimler-benz has been plagued with problems at chrysler ever since it took over america ’ s number three carmaker in 1998 .
the unit ’ s market share in the united states has dropped from around 16 percent to an estimated 12 percent for this year . “ we interpret management ’ s most recent words and deeds as an indication that a successful revival of chrysler will be postponed ever further into the future , ” analysts from the landesbank baden-württemberg wrote in a report . mixed bag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler concept car 300c but daimlerchrysler ’ s woes aside , this year is shaping up to be a mixed bag for the rest of the german car industry . germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen is expecting 2003 results to be considerably lower than the € 1.8 billion in pre-tax profit it earned last year .
the weak economy in europe and america and the strong euro all helped drag down results for the first half by nearly 58 percent .
it is also slashing 4,000 jobs in brazil , as demand in latin america stagnates . but with the new golf v hitting the market last friday , vw is hoping for a late fourth-quarter surge in sales this year .
volkswagen has already unloaded 33,700 of the new golf in pre-sales and the company hopes to flog around another 100,000 by the end of the year .
in order to meet demand , the company is upping production quotas at its flagship production facilities in wolfsburg . german carmaker opel , owned by u.s. giant general motors , is hoping it can overtake vw for new car registrations in western europe this year .
in the first nine months of 2003 , opel managed to post 1.03 million new registrations .
in comparison , the company ’ s arch-rival volkswagen had 1.09 million in registrations for the same period . investment in the astra , the company ’ s competition for the new golf , reportedly contributed to the € 90 million loss in the third quarter for opel .
but opel still hopes to narrow its losses for all of 2003 compared to last year ’ s € 227 million loss . asian expansion but not all of germany ’ s carmakers are focusing on europe or america in 2003 .
bavaria ’ s upscale bmw is using this year to shift its chinese auto production into high gear .
over the weekend , the company has begun offering the first domestically produced autos in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's helmut panke the german-chinese joint venture sells the bmw 325i model for € 20,000 less than what the import model costs in china .

auto giant daimlerchrysler may have posted lousy figures for the third quarter this week , but as 2003 comes to a close it looks like this year will offer the german car industry more than just gloom and doom . with operating profit plummeting 19 percent and sales dropping five percent in the third quarter , things look pretty grim for german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler .

daimlerchrysler actually managed to squeeze out a tiny profit at chrysler in the third quarter by cutting costs , but unfortunately the u.s. market remains a vicious place with rebates and other sales incentives . the stuttgart-based daimler-benz has been plagued with problems at chrysler ever since it took over america ’ s number three carmaker in 1998 .
the unit ’ s market share in the united states has dropped from around 16 percent to an estimated 12 percent for this year . “ we interpret management ’ s most recent words and deeds as an indication that a successful revival of chrysler will be postponed ever further into the future , ” analysts from the landesbank baden-württemberg wrote in a report . mixed bag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler concept car 300c but daimlerchrysler ’ s woes aside , this year is shaping up to be a mixed bag for the rest of the german car industry . germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen is expecting 2003 results to be considerably lower than the € 1.8 billion in pre-tax profit it earned last year .

in order to meet demand , the company is upping production quotas at its flagship production facilities in wolfsburg . german carmaker opel , owned by u.s. giant general motors , is hoping it can overtake vw for new car registrations in western europe this year .
in the first nine months of 2003 , opel managed to post 1.03 million new registrations .
in comparison , the company ’ s arch-rival volkswagen had 1.09 million in registrations for the same period . investment in the astra , the company ’ s competition for the new golf , reportedly contributed to the € 90 million loss in the third quarter for opel .

german families love each other , but they have a hard time showing it , according to a study released on wednesday by the german magazine eltern -lrb- " parents " -rrb- .
ninety percent of germans feel that their family loves them , a survey of 1,000 people conducted for the magazine by the polling company tns emnid revealed .
but one in three complained that they are not shown enough affection .
praise , it seems , is also not doled out often enough , with 22 percent of men and 36 percent of women saying they would like to have more positive reinforcement thrown their way .
and as for unconditional love , sadly one in ten of those surveyed said he or she is not accepted as is . more briefs 22.10.2003 -pipe- the future of german energy policy outlined 22.10.2003 -pipe- germany to do more to fight aids 21.10.2003 -pipe- schröder defends eu constitution draft 21.10.2003 -pipe- extremists on trial for arson attacks 21.10.2003 -pipe- germany 's jewish population soars 21.10.2003 -pipe- bulgaria investigates german spy scandal 20.10.2003 -pipe- hostages asked to pay up 20.10.2003 -pipe- hitting the jackpot radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

among the most controversial of the many proposals is one giving the defence minister - in extreme circumstances outlined in the legislation - the right to order a plane shot .
volker beck , the manger of parliamentary affairs for the green party , has denounced the draft as a " license to kill " and says that at best new regulations can establish a chain-of-command to decide what to do in emergency situations , but it ca n't foresee each and every eventuality in specifics and prescribe what to do . more briefs 22.10.2003 -pipe- german families love , but do they show it ? 22.10.2003 -pipe- the future of german energy policy outlined 22.10.2003 -pipe- germany to do more to fight aids 21.10.2003 -pipe- schröder defends eu constitution draft 21.10.2003 -pipe- extremists on trial for arson attacks 21.10.2003 -pipe- germany 's jewish population soars 21.10.2003 -pipe- bulgaria investigates german spy scandal 20.10.2003 -pipe- hostages asked to pay up radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

traffic committee chairman eduard oswald said the contract would be closely scrutinized in order to determine whether penalties could be brought against the collective responsible for creating the defective system , which has been on hold since technical problems delayed its introduction earlier this year . the system has been designed and operated by the toll collect consortium , owned by deutsche telekom , daimlerchrysler and france 's cofiroute .
the transportation ministry has said that from december , delays will cost the government € 156 million a month in lost revenue , with the consortium facing penalties of € 250,000 a day until the end of february , at which point the fine would go up to € 500,000 per day . more briefs 22.10.2003 -pipe- warner music germany mulls berlin move 21.10.2003 -pipe- eu takes germany to court over can deposit law 21.10.2003 -pipe- daimlerchrysler posts third quarter losses 21.10.2003 -pipe- deutsche bahn to cut service personnel 21.10.2003 -pipe- minister rules out cancelling iraq debt 21.10.2003 -pipe- german officials angered by eurofighter delay 20.10.2003 -pipe- fewer cigarettes sold in germany 20.10.2003 -pipe- pay tv turns profit radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as yet another shipload of illegal migrants is discovered off southern italy , the pressure increases on eu states to resolve the migration issue . at least 13 people were found dead in a small wooden boat adrift in the mediterranean between north africa and italy , and many more are believed to have died during a strenuous three-week odyssey to europe ’ s shores .
on monday a spokesperson for the italian coastguard , which fished out the 40-foot vessel southeast of the island of lampedusa , said that the pile of decaying corpses and severely emaciated survivors was like something straight out of dante ’ s inferno .
captain stefano valfre , who first sighted the ship drifting near sicily , told reporters that the 15 surviving refugees had said that as many as 100 people had originally boarded the boat , and that they had thrown the bodies of the dead overboard , until they had become too weak to do even that .
the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .
although italy has been most recentlyaeffected by the ceaseless wave of refugees lapping at its door , the problem is one that all of europe faces .
europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "
a non-quantifiable figure bodies such as the international center for migration policy development -lrb- icmpd -rrb- estimate that the population of europe is rising by up to one million a year , including illegal migration , but stress that the phenomenon is not statistically quantifiable .
each year , hundreds of thousands slip through europe 's borders and wash up its shores , unobserved and uncounted .
and as the eu expands eastwards and its borders touch those of states such as the ukraine and russia , where human trafficking is already a known problem , many in the european commission fear europe will be overwhelmed with even more illegal migrants .
" fortress europe " with seemingly more urgency than ever , the interior ministers from france , germany , britain , italy and spain forged ahead with their plans for toughening up their border security .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy proposed the creation of a " european security zone " for protection against illegal immigration via the mediterranean sea , which would be patrolled both along the european and african coast .
the five ministers discussed a " three plus three " cooperation deal involving france , italy and spain sponsoring efforts in algeria , morocco and tunisia to halt the exodus of clandestine migrants .
the " big five " also announced they had agreed to boost police cooperation , reforming the collective eu police agency europol , clamping down on gangs dealing in human trafficking , and putting microchips on visas for the eu 's schengen area that would include fingerprints and face-scans in digital form .
nicolas sarkozy rejected suggestions the eu was being turned into " fortress europe , " reducing the numbers arriving by making migrants ' chances of entry less and less likely .
national sensitivities last week , a number of eu states resisted a plan to introduce quotas on legal immigration , expressing doubts about how it could work in practice .
the scheme foresaw decisions made at a national level on how many people to admit and from which country , with the european commission assuming a coordinating function .
for now , the amsterdam treaty , which came into force on may 1 , 1999 , provides the legal basis for a common european union immigration policy .
the deadline for a new common asylum and migration policy is set for may 2004 .
but with eu states still wrangling over the border management agency which would coordinate existing centers responsible for border control and the migration issue still a sticking point in the first european constitution , it seems that when it comes to migration , most countries are unwilling to hand over the decision-making to brussels .
the pressure on governments to cooperate is considerable .
spanish interior minister angel acebes pointed out in la baule that " we will be forced , sooner or later , to share a part of the cost , because if a member of the european community does not defend its borders , then we will all pay for the consequences .

traffic committee chairman eduard oswald said the contract would be closely scrutinized in order to determine whether penalties could be brought against the collective responsible for creating the defective system , which has been on hold since technical problems delayed its introduction earlier this year . the system has been designed and operated by the toll collect consortium , owned by deutsche telekom , daimlerchrysler and france 's cofiroute .
the transportation ministry has said that from december , delays will cost the government € 156 million a month in lost revenue , with the consortium facing penalties of € 250,000 a day until the end of february , at which point the fine would go up to € 500,000 per day . more briefs 22.10.2003 -pipe- warner music germany mulls berlin move 21.10.2003 -pipe- eu takes germany to court over can deposit law 21.10.2003 -pipe- daimlerchrysler posts third quarter losses 21.10.2003 -pipe- deutsche bahn to cut service personnel 21.10.2003 -pipe- minister rules out cancelling iraq debt 21.10.2003 -pipe- german officials angered by eurofighter delay 20.10.2003 -pipe- fewer cigarettes sold in germany 20.10.2003 -pipe- pay tv turns profit radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as yet another shipload of illegal migrants is discovered off southern italy , the pressure increases on eu states to resolve the migration issue . at least 13 people were found dead in a small wooden boat adrift in the mediterranean between north africa and italy , and many more are believed to have died during a strenuous three-week odyssey to europe ’ s shores .
on monday a spokesperson for the italian coastguard , which fished out the 40-foot vessel southeast of the island of lampedusa , said that the pile of decaying corpses and severely emaciated survivors was like something straight out of dante ’ s inferno .
captain stefano valfre , who first sighted the ship drifting near sicily , told reporters that the 15 surviving refugees had said that as many as 100 people had originally boarded the boat , and that they had thrown the bodies of the dead overboard , until they had become too weak to do even that .
the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .
although italy has been most recentlyaeffected by the ceaseless wave of refugees lapping at its door , the problem is one that all of europe faces .
europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "
a non-quantifiable figure bodies such as the international center for migration policy development -lrb- icmpd -rrb- estimate that the population of europe is rising by up to one million a year , including illegal migration , but stress that the phenomenon is not statistically quantifiable .
each year , hundreds of thousands slip through europe 's borders and wash up its shores , unobserved and uncounted .
and as the eu expands eastwards and its borders touch those of states such as the ukraine and russia , where human trafficking is already a known problem , many in the european commission fear europe will be overwhelmed with even more illegal migrants .
" fortress europe " with seemingly more urgency than ever , the interior ministers from france , germany , britain , italy and spain forged ahead with their plans for toughening up their border security .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy proposed the creation of a " european security zone " for protection against illegal immigration via the mediterranean sea , which would be patrolled both along the european and african coast .
the five ministers discussed a " three plus three " cooperation deal involving france , italy and spain sponsoring efforts in algeria , morocco and tunisia to halt the exodus of clandestine migrants .
the " big five " also announced they had agreed to boost police cooperation , reforming the collective eu police agency europol , clamping down on gangs dealing in human trafficking , and putting microchips on visas for the eu 's schengen area that would include fingerprints and face-scans in digital form .
nicolas sarkozy rejected suggestions the eu was being turned into " fortress europe , " reducing the numbers arriving by making migrants ' chances of entry less and less likely .
national sensitivities last week , a number of eu states resisted a plan to introduce quotas on legal immigration , expressing doubts about how it could work in practice .
the scheme foresaw decisions made at a national level on how many people to admit and from which country , with the european commission assuming a coordinating function .
for now , the amsterdam treaty , which came into force on may 1 , 1999 , provides the legal basis for a common european union immigration policy .
the deadline for a new common asylum and migration policy is set for may 2004 .
but with eu states still wrangling over the border management agency which would coordinate existing centers responsible for border control and the migration issue still a sticking point in the first european constitution , it seems that when it comes to migration , most countries are unwilling to hand over the decision-making to brussels .
the pressure on governments to cooperate is considerable .

some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .
german schools have been slower to follow . three states ban advertising outright , but amid steadily shrinking school budgets most allow their schools to rent out ad space as long as it helps them to buy needed materials . " there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .
most teens receive an average monthly allowance of € 80 and spend liberally on clothes and mobile phones , according to a recent study by publishers axel springer and bauer verlag . that 's exactly why teenagers should n't receive more encouragement at school , say some . " there 's enough advertising already , " says susanne levin , a teacher at the falkschule .
" wherever they go , children are encouraged to spend money on things they do n't need , and it does n't need to happen at school too . " state school authorities agree . " fortunately , schools are still a place that can offer an escape from reality , at least in some areas , " said hans-rolf eifer , from the hesse school authority .

some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .
german schools have been slower to follow . three states ban advertising outright , but amid steadily shrinking school budgets most allow their schools to rent out ad space as long as it helps them to buy needed materials . " there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .
most teens receive an average monthly allowance of € 80 and spend liberally on clothes and mobile phones , according to a recent study by publishers axel springer and bauer verlag . that 's exactly why teenagers should n't receive more encouragement at school , say some . " there 's enough advertising already , " says susanne levin , a teacher at the falkschule .
" wherever they go , children are encouraged to spend money on things they do n't need , and it does n't need to happen at school too . " state school authorities agree . " fortunately , schools are still a place that can offer an escape from reality , at least in some areas , " said hans-rolf eifer , from the hesse school authority .

as yet another shipload of illegal migrants is discovered off southern italy , the pressure increases on eu states to resolve the migration issue . at least 13 people were found dead in a small wooden boat adrift in the mediterranean between north africa and italy , and many more are believed to have died during a strenuous three-week odyssey to europe ’ s shores .
on monday a spokesperson for the italian coastguard , which fished out the 40-foot vessel southeast of the island of lampedusa , said that the pile of decaying corpses and severely emaciated survivors was like something straight out of dante ’ s inferno .
captain stefano valfre , who first sighted the ship drifting near sicily , told reporters that the 15 surviving refugees had said that as many as 100 people had originally boarded the boat , and that they had thrown the bodies of the dead overboard , until they had become too weak to do even that .
the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .
although italy has been most recentlyaeffected by the ceaseless wave of refugees lapping at its door , the problem is one that all of europe faces .
europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "
a non-quantifiable figure bodies such as the international center for migration policy development -lrb- icmpd -rrb- estimate that the population of europe is rising by up to one million a year , including illegal migration , but stress that the phenomenon is not statistically quantifiable .
each year , hundreds of thousands slip through europe 's borders and wash up its shores , unobserved and uncounted .
and as the eu expands eastwards and its borders touch those of states such as the ukraine and russia , where human trafficking is already a known problem , many in the european commission fear europe will be overwhelmed with even more illegal migrants .
" fortress europe " with seemingly more urgency than ever , the interior ministers from france , germany , britain , italy and spain forged ahead with their plans for toughening up their border security .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy proposed the creation of a " european security zone " for protection against illegal immigration via the mediterranean sea , which would be patrolled both along the european and african coast .
the five ministers discussed a " three plus three " cooperation deal involving france , italy and spain sponsoring efforts in algeria , morocco and tunisia to halt the exodus of clandestine migrants .
the " big five " also announced they had agreed to boost police cooperation , reforming the collective eu police agency europol , clamping down on gangs dealing in human trafficking , and putting microchips on visas for the eu 's schengen area that would include fingerprints and face-scans in digital form .
nicolas sarkozy rejected suggestions the eu was being turned into " fortress europe , " reducing the numbers arriving by making migrants ' chances of entry less and less likely .
national sensitivities last week , a number of eu states resisted a plan to introduce quotas on legal immigration , expressing doubts about how it could work in practice .
the scheme foresaw decisions made at a national level on how many people to admit and from which country , with the european commission assuming a coordinating function .
for now , the amsterdam treaty , which came into force on may 1 , 1999 , provides the legal basis for a common european union immigration policy .
the deadline for a new common asylum and migration policy is set for may 2004 .
but with eu states still wrangling over the border management agency which would coordinate existing centers responsible for border control and the migration issue still a sticking point in the first european constitution , it seems that when it comes to migration , most countries are unwilling to hand over the decision-making to brussels .
the pressure on governments to cooperate is considerable .
spanish interior minister angel acebes pointed out in la baule that " we will be forced , sooner or later , to share a part of the cost , because if a member of the european community does not defend its borders , then we will all pay for the consequences .

as yet another shipload of illegal migrants is discovered off southern italy , the pressure increases on eu states to resolve the migration issue . at least 13 people were found dead in a small wooden boat adrift in the mediterranean between north africa and italy , and many more are believed to have died during a strenuous three-week odyssey to europe ’ s shores .
on monday a spokesperson for the italian coastguard , which fished out the 40-foot vessel southeast of the island of lampedusa , said that the pile of decaying corpses and severely emaciated survivors was like something straight out of dante ’ s inferno .
captain stefano valfre , who first sighted the ship drifting near sicily , told reporters that the 15 surviving refugees had said that as many as 100 people had originally boarded the boat , and that they had thrown the bodies of the dead overboard , until they had become too weak to do even that .
the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .
although italy has been most recentlyaeffected by the ceaseless wave of refugees lapping at its door , the problem is one that all of europe faces .
europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "
a non-quantifiable figure bodies such as the international center for migration policy development -lrb- icmpd -rrb- estimate that the population of europe is rising by up to one million a year , including illegal migration , but stress that the phenomenon is not statistically quantifiable .
each year , hundreds of thousands slip through europe 's borders and wash up its shores , unobserved and uncounted .
and as the eu expands eastwards and its borders touch those of states such as the ukraine and russia , where human trafficking is already a known problem , many in the european commission fear europe will be overwhelmed with even more illegal migrants .
" fortress europe " with seemingly more urgency than ever , the interior ministers from france , germany , britain , italy and spain forged ahead with their plans for toughening up their border security .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy proposed the creation of a " european security zone " for protection against illegal immigration via the mediterranean sea , which would be patrolled both along the european and african coast .
the five ministers discussed a " three plus three " cooperation deal involving france , italy and spain sponsoring efforts in algeria , morocco and tunisia to halt the exodus of clandestine migrants .
the " big five " also announced they had agreed to boost police cooperation , reforming the collective eu police agency europol , clamping down on gangs dealing in human trafficking , and putting microchips on visas for the eu 's schengen area that would include fingerprints and face-scans in digital form .
nicolas sarkozy rejected suggestions the eu was being turned into " fortress europe , " reducing the numbers arriving by making migrants ' chances of entry less and less likely .
national sensitivities last week , a number of eu states resisted a plan to introduce quotas on legal immigration , expressing doubts about how it could work in practice .
the scheme foresaw decisions made at a national level on how many people to admit and from which country , with the european commission assuming a coordinating function .
for now , the amsterdam treaty , which came into force on may 1 , 1999 , provides the legal basis for a common european union immigration policy .
the deadline for a new common asylum and migration policy is set for may 2004 .
but with eu states still wrangling over the border management agency which would coordinate existing centers responsible for border control and the migration issue still a sticking point in the first european constitution , it seems that when it comes to migration , most countries are unwilling to hand over the decision-making to brussels .
the pressure on governments to cooperate is considerable .
spanish interior minister angel acebes pointed out in la baule that " we will be forced , sooner or later , to share a part of the cost , because if a member of the european community does not defend its borders , then we will all pay for the consequences .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .
only when the numbers of exhibitors and visitors to the big computer fairs start rising again will the first tentative signals of growth be cause for celebration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .

auto giant daimlerchrysler may have posted lousy figures for the third quarter this week , but as 2003 comes to a close it looks like this year will offer the german car industry more than just gloom and doom . with operating profit plummeting 19 percent and sales dropping five percent in the third quarter , things look pretty grim for german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler .
after posting results including a massive net € 1.65 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- loss on tuesday , the world ’ s fifth largest auto company punished with a sinking share price and downgrades galore . as equity analysts ratcheted down their stock price targets for the year , rating agency standard & poor ’ s cut daimlerchrysler ’ s credit rating from bbb + to bbb with a negative outlook , citing how the company continues to be hobbled by its troubled american unit chrysler . although the firm ’ s german mercedes luxury brand continues to sell well , most analysts believe daimlerchrysler can only flourish if it manages to turn things around at the american unit .
daimlerchrysler actually managed to squeeze out a tiny profit at chrysler in the third quarter by cutting costs , but unfortunately the u.s. market remains a vicious place with rebates and other sales incentives . the stuttgart-based daimler-benz has been plagued with problems at chrysler ever since it took over america ’ s number three carmaker in 1998 .
the unit ’ s market share in the united states has dropped from around 16 percent to an estimated 12 percent for this year . “ we interpret management ’ s most recent words and deeds as an indication that a successful revival of chrysler will be postponed ever further into the future , ” analysts from the landesbank baden-württemberg wrote in a report . mixed bag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler concept car 300c but daimlerchrysler ’ s woes aside , this year is shaping up to be a mixed bag for the rest of the german car industry . germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen is expecting 2003 results to be considerably lower than the € 1.8 billion in pre-tax profit it earned last year .
the weak economy in europe and america and the strong euro all helped drag down results for the first half by nearly 58 percent .
it is also slashing 4,000 jobs in brazil , as demand in latin america stagnates . but with the new golf v hitting the market last friday , vw is hoping for a late fourth-quarter surge in sales this year .
volkswagen has already unloaded 33,700 of the new golf in pre-sales and the company hopes to flog around another 100,000 by the end of the year .
in order to meet demand , the company is upping production quotas at its flagship production facilities in wolfsburg . german carmaker opel , owned by u.s. giant general motors , is hoping it can overtake vw for new car registrations in western europe this year .
in the first nine months of 2003 , opel managed to post 1.03 million new registrations .
in comparison , the company ’ s arch-rival volkswagen had 1.09 million in registrations for the same period . investment in the astra , the company ’ s competition for the new golf , reportedly contributed to the € 90 million loss in the third quarter for opel .
but opel still hopes to narrow its losses for all of 2003 compared to last year ’ s € 227 million loss . asian expansion but not all of germany ’ s carmakers are focusing on europe or america in 2003 .

a day after the un passed a resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a security fence , israel 's foreign minister made his first visit to germany and defended his country 's right to security . israeli foreign minister silvan shalom began a three-day visit to germany wednesday with the official purpose of drawing attention to and condemning the rise of anti-semitism in europe and around the world .
but as israeli government officials vowed to press-on with efforts to build a controversial security fence in palestinian territory despite a day-old un resolution - sponsored by the european union - calling on israel to cease and desist , rising tensions in the middle east overshadowed shalom 's visit . speaking during a visit to a former concentration camp north of berlin , the israeli foreign minister defended his government 's hardened stance , stating that , " it is our right to defend our land and our citizens , a right no one can take away from us . " making the rounds in berlin the foreign minister began his visit to germany 's capitol on wednesday by meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder - details of their conversation were not released to the press .
he then travelled to a former concentration camp in sachsenhausen , just north of berlin . laying flowers on the grounds where thousands of jews were killed by the nazis , shalom used the opportunity to warn about the growing threat of anti-semitism in europe and the arab world .
" today , less than 60 years after the holocaust , we are witnesses to a re-sprouting of anti-semitism in europe .
this sprays its poison not just against its traditional goal , jews , but the new anti-semitism is also directed against israel , " he told the crowd . attacks against jews have been on the rise in germany .
last month , police uncovered a plot by several far-right groups to bomb a jewish sight in munich . later wednesday night , shalom met with the german foreign minister joschka fischer , but the two discussed more than the problems of anti-semitism and touched on the mounting crisis in the middle east .
they discussed the eu 's role in dealing with iran , and germany 's role as intermediary in an upcoming hostage exchange between israel and hezbollah militants . the future of middle east peace hangs in the balance and all must work towards that goal .
a spokesman for fischer reiterated the german position : " the implementation of the ' road map ' is without an alternative . " defiant israel builds fence , despite un demands shalom arrived in germany a day after the un general assembly passed a tough new resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a controversial security fence , which is located within palestinian territory . the resolution was sponsored by the european union , and all 15 members , including germany , voted to support it in the general assembly .
the vote passed with 144 in favor and 4 against , including the united states and israel .
-lrb- twelve countries abstained . -rrb- the eu agreed to sponsor the resolution after an earlier version proposed by arab governments was toned down .
the compromise text calls on israel to " stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the occupied palestinian territory , " which it says is " in contradiction to relevant provisions of international law . "
the arab government 's resolution proposed turning the matter over to the international court of justice to issue an advisory opinion , which the eu member states objected to . despite the un 's censure , israeli officials , the foreign minister included , say their government wo n't reverse course .
shalom made this position known during his visit to berlin , and back home , israel 's deputy prime minister , ehud olmert , stated the same thing more explicitly .
" the fence will continue being built and we will go on taking care of the security of israel 's citizens , " olmert told israel radio . how can israel continue to go against the will of the majority of the international community , including the will of the eu ?
" israel can and will ignore the latest un resolution for one simple reason : israel can be sure of the usa 's support , " avi primor , the former israeli ambassador to germany told deutsche welle .

but as israeli government officials vowed to press-on with efforts to build a controversial security fence in palestinian territory despite a day-old un resolution - sponsored by the european union - calling on israel to cease and desist , rising tensions in the middle east overshadowed shalom 's visit . speaking during a visit to a former concentration camp north of berlin , the israeli foreign minister defended his government 's hardened stance , stating that , " it is our right to defend our land and our citizens , a right no one can take away from us . " making the rounds in berlin the foreign minister began his visit to germany 's capitol on wednesday by meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder - details of their conversation were not released to the press .
he then travelled to a former concentration camp in sachsenhausen , just north of berlin . laying flowers on the grounds where thousands of jews were killed by the nazis , shalom used the opportunity to warn about the growing threat of anti-semitism in europe and the arab world .
" today , less than 60 years after the holocaust , we are witnesses to a re-sprouting of anti-semitism in europe .
this sprays its poison not just against its traditional goal , jews , but the new anti-semitism is also directed against israel , " he told the crowd . attacks against jews have been on the rise in germany .
last month , police uncovered a plot by several far-right groups to bomb a jewish sight in munich . later wednesday night , shalom met with the german foreign minister joschka fischer , but the two discussed more than the problems of anti-semitism and touched on the mounting crisis in the middle east .
they discussed the eu 's role in dealing with iran , and germany 's role as intermediary in an upcoming hostage exchange between israel and hezbollah militants . the future of middle east peace hangs in the balance and all must work towards that goal .
a spokesman for fischer reiterated the german position : " the implementation of the ' road map ' is without an alternative . " defiant israel builds fence , despite un demands shalom arrived in germany a day after the un general assembly passed a tough new resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a controversial security fence , which is located within palestinian territory . the resolution was sponsored by the european union , and all 15 members , including germany , voted to support it in the general assembly .
the vote passed with 144 in favor and 4 against , including the united states and israel .

the arab government 's resolution proposed turning the matter over to the international court of justice to issue an advisory opinion , which the eu member states objected to . despite the un 's censure , israeli officials , the foreign minister included , say their government wo n't reverse course .

some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .
german schools have been slower to follow . three states ban advertising outright , but amid steadily shrinking school budgets most allow their schools to rent out ad space as long as it helps them to buy needed materials . " there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .
most teens receive an average monthly allowance of € 80 and spend liberally on clothes and mobile phones , according to a recent study by publishers axel springer and bauer verlag . that 's exactly why teenagers should n't receive more encouragement at school , say some . " there 's enough advertising already , " says susanne levin , a teacher at the falkschule .
" wherever they go , children are encouraged to spend money on things they do n't need , and it does n't need to happen at school too . " state school authorities agree . " fortunately , schools are still a place that can offer an escape from reality , at least in some areas , " said hans-rolf eifer , from the hesse school authority .
" schools can make students aware of negative developments , which i think should n't be taking place everywhere in the first place .

european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .

some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .
german schools have been slower to follow . three states ban advertising outright , but amid steadily shrinking school budgets most allow their schools to rent out ad space as long as it helps them to buy needed materials . " there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .
most teens receive an average monthly allowance of € 80 and spend liberally on clothes and mobile phones , according to a recent study by publishers axel springer and bauer verlag . that 's exactly why teenagers should n't receive more encouragement at school , say some . " there 's enough advertising already , " says susanne levin , a teacher at the falkschule .
" wherever they go , children are encouraged to spend money on things they do n't need , and it does n't need to happen at school too . " state school authorities agree . " fortunately , schools are still a place that can offer an escape from reality , at least in some areas , " said hans-rolf eifer , from the hesse school authority .

european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .

european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.10.2003 stop and go in 2003 for german carmakers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler has fewer problems selling mercedes than its u.s. models .
auto giant daimlerchrysler may have posted lousy figures for the third quarter this week , but as 2003 comes to a close it looks like this year will offer the german car industry more than just gloom and doom . with operating profit plummeting 19 percent and sales dropping five percent in the third quarter , things look pretty grim for german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler .
after posting results including a massive net € 1.65 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- loss on tuesday , the world ’ s fifth largest auto company punished with a sinking share price and downgrades galore . as equity analysts ratcheted down their stock price targets for the year , rating agency standard & poor ’ s cut daimlerchrysler ’ s credit rating from bbb + to bbb with a negative outlook , citing how the company continues to be hobbled by its troubled american unit chrysler . although the firm ’ s german mercedes luxury brand continues to sell well , most analysts believe daimlerchrysler can only flourish if it manages to turn things around at the american unit .
daimlerchrysler actually managed to squeeze out a tiny profit at chrysler in the third quarter by cutting costs , but unfortunately the u.s. market remains a vicious place with rebates and other sales incentives . the stuttgart-based daimler-benz has been plagued with problems at chrysler ever since it took over america ’ s number three carmaker in 1998 .
the unit ’ s market share in the united states has dropped from around 16 percent to an estimated 12 percent for this year . “ we interpret management ’ s most recent words and deeds as an indication that a successful revival of chrysler will be postponed ever further into the future , ” analysts from the landesbank baden-württemberg wrote in a report . mixed bag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler concept car 300c but daimlerchrysler ’ s woes aside , this year is shaping up to be a mixed bag for the rest of the german car industry . germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen is expecting 2003 results to be considerably lower than the € 1.8 billion in pre-tax profit it earned last year .
the weak economy in europe and america and the strong euro all helped drag down results for the first half by nearly 58 percent .
it is also slashing 4,000 jobs in brazil , as demand in latin america stagnates . but with the new golf v hitting the market last friday , vw is hoping for a late fourth-quarter surge in sales this year .
volkswagen has already unloaded 33,700 of the new golf in pre-sales and the company hopes to flog around another 100,000 by the end of the year .
in order to meet demand , the company is upping production quotas at its flagship production facilities in wolfsburg . german carmaker opel , owned by u.s. giant general motors , is hoping it can overtake vw for new car registrations in western europe this year .
in the first nine months of 2003 , opel managed to post 1.03 million new registrations .
in comparison , the company ’ s arch-rival volkswagen had 1.09 million in registrations for the same period . investment in the astra , the company ’ s competition for the new golf , reportedly contributed to the € 90 million loss in the third quarter for opel .
but opel still hopes to narrow its losses for all of 2003 compared to last year ’ s € 227 million loss . asian expansion but not all of germany ’ s carmakers are focusing on europe or america in 2003 .
bavaria ’ s upscale bmw is using this year to shift its chinese auto production into high gear .
over the weekend , the company has begun offering the first domestically produced autos in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's helmut panke the german-chinese joint venture sells the bmw 325i model for € 20,000 less than what the import model costs in china .
the lower prices should help spur demand for the estimated 30,000 units bmw plans to roll off the factory lines each year . on wednesday , bmw board member helmut panke in tokyo said the company planned on doubling its sales throughout asia in five years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen pins revival hopes on new golf volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain .

some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .
german schools have been slower to follow . three states ban advertising outright , but amid steadily shrinking school budgets most allow their schools to rent out ad space as long as it helps them to buy needed materials . " there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .
most teens receive an average monthly allowance of € 80 and spend liberally on clothes and mobile phones , according to a recent study by publishers axel springer and bauer verlag . that 's exactly why teenagers should n't receive more encouragement at school , say some . " there 's enough advertising already , " says susanne levin , a teacher at the falkschule .
" wherever they go , children are encouraged to spend money on things they do n't need , and it does n't need to happen at school too . " state school authorities agree . " fortunately , schools are still a place that can offer an escape from reality , at least in some areas , " said hans-rolf eifer , from the hesse school authority .
" schools can make students aware of negative developments , which i think should n't be taking place everywhere in the first place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 22.10.2003 compromise or bust for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's first constitution is still just a draft on paper .
european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

as yet another shipload of illegal migrants is discovered off southern italy , the pressure increases on eu states to resolve the migration issue . at least 13 people were found dead in a small wooden boat adrift in the mediterranean between north africa and italy , and many more are believed to have died during a strenuous three-week odyssey to europe ’ s shores .
on monday a spokesperson for the italian coastguard , which fished out the 40-foot vessel southeast of the island of lampedusa , said that the pile of decaying corpses and severely emaciated survivors was like something straight out of dante ’ s inferno .
captain stefano valfre , who first sighted the ship drifting near sicily , told reporters that the 15 surviving refugees had said that as many as 100 people had originally boarded the boat , and that they had thrown the bodies of the dead overboard , until they had become too weak to do even that .
the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .
although italy has been most recentlyaeffected by the ceaseless wave of refugees lapping at its door , the problem is one that all of europe faces .
europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "
a non-quantifiable figure bodies such as the international center for migration policy development -lrb- icmpd -rrb- estimate that the population of europe is rising by up to one million a year , including illegal migration , but stress that the phenomenon is not statistically quantifiable .
each year , hundreds of thousands slip through europe 's borders and wash up its shores , unobserved and uncounted .
and as the eu expands eastwards and its borders touch those of states such as the ukraine and russia , where human trafficking is already a known problem , many in the european commission fear europe will be overwhelmed with even more illegal migrants .
" fortress europe " with seemingly more urgency than ever , the interior ministers from france , germany , britain , italy and spain forged ahead with their plans for toughening up their border security .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy proposed the creation of a " european security zone " for protection against illegal immigration via the mediterranean sea , which would be patrolled both along the european and african coast .
the five ministers discussed a " three plus three " cooperation deal involving france , italy and spain sponsoring efforts in algeria , morocco and tunisia to halt the exodus of clandestine migrants .
the " big five " also announced they had agreed to boost police cooperation , reforming the collective eu police agency europol , clamping down on gangs dealing in human trafficking , and putting microchips on visas for the eu 's schengen area that would include fingerprints and face-scans in digital form .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .
only when the numbers of exhibitors and visitors to the big computer fairs start rising again will the first tentative signals of growth be cause for celebration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .

some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .
german schools have been slower to follow . three states ban advertising outright , but amid steadily shrinking school budgets most allow their schools to rent out ad space as long as it helps them to buy needed materials . " there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .
most teens receive an average monthly allowance of € 80 and spend liberally on clothes and mobile phones , according to a recent study by publishers axel springer and bauer verlag . that 's exactly why teenagers should n't receive more encouragement at school , say some . " there 's enough advertising already , " says susanne levin , a teacher at the falkschule .
" wherever they go , children are encouraged to spend money on things they do n't need , and it does n't need to happen at school too . " state school authorities agree . " fortunately , schools are still a place that can offer an escape from reality , at least in some areas , " said hans-rolf eifer , from the hesse school authority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 22.10.2003 compromise or bust for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's first constitution is still just a draft on paper .
european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .
only when the numbers of exhibitors and visitors to the big computer fairs start rising again will the first tentative signals of growth be cause for celebration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .

auto giant daimlerchrysler may have posted lousy figures for the third quarter this week , but as 2003 comes to a close it looks like this year will offer the german car industry more than just gloom and doom . with operating profit plummeting 19 percent and sales dropping five percent in the third quarter , things look pretty grim for german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler .
after posting results including a massive net € 1.65 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- loss on tuesday , the world ’ s fifth largest auto company punished with a sinking share price and downgrades galore . as equity analysts ratcheted down their stock price targets for the year , rating agency standard & poor ’ s cut daimlerchrysler ’ s credit rating from bbb + to bbb with a negative outlook , citing how the company continues to be hobbled by its troubled american unit chrysler . although the firm ’ s german mercedes luxury brand continues to sell well , most analysts believe daimlerchrysler can only flourish if it manages to turn things around at the american unit .
daimlerchrysler actually managed to squeeze out a tiny profit at chrysler in the third quarter by cutting costs , but unfortunately the u.s. market remains a vicious place with rebates and other sales incentives . the stuttgart-based daimler-benz has been plagued with problems at chrysler ever since it took over america ’ s number three carmaker in 1998 .
the unit ’ s market share in the united states has dropped from around 16 percent to an estimated 12 percent for this year . “ we interpret management ’ s most recent words and deeds as an indication that a successful revival of chrysler will be postponed ever further into the future , ” analysts from the landesbank baden-württemberg wrote in a report . mixed bag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler concept car 300c but daimlerchrysler ’ s woes aside , this year is shaping up to be a mixed bag for the rest of the german car industry . germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen is expecting 2003 results to be considerably lower than the € 1.8 billion in pre-tax profit it earned last year .

a day after the un passed a resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a security fence , israel 's foreign minister made his first visit to germany and defended his country 's right to security . israeli foreign minister silvan shalom began a three-day visit to germany wednesday with the official purpose of drawing attention to and condemning the rise of anti-semitism in europe and around the world .
but as israeli government officials vowed to press-on with efforts to build a controversial security fence in palestinian territory despite a day-old un resolution - sponsored by the european union - calling on israel to cease and desist , rising tensions in the middle east overshadowed shalom 's visit . speaking during a visit to a former concentration camp north of berlin , the israeli foreign minister defended his government 's hardened stance , stating that , " it is our right to defend our land and our citizens , a right no one can take away from us . " making the rounds in berlin the foreign minister began his visit to germany 's capitol on wednesday by meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder - details of their conversation were not released to the press .
he then travelled to a former concentration camp in sachsenhausen , just north of berlin . laying flowers on the grounds where thousands of jews were killed by the nazis , shalom used the opportunity to warn about the growing threat of anti-semitism in europe and the arab world .
" today , less than 60 years after the holocaust , we are witnesses to a re-sprouting of anti-semitism in europe .
this sprays its poison not just against its traditional goal , jews , but the new anti-semitism is also directed against israel , " he told the crowd . attacks against jews have been on the rise in germany .
last month , police uncovered a plot by several far-right groups to bomb a jewish sight in munich . later wednesday night , shalom met with the german foreign minister joschka fischer , but the two discussed more than the problems of anti-semitism and touched on the mounting crisis in the middle east .
they discussed the eu 's role in dealing with iran , and germany 's role as intermediary in an upcoming hostage exchange between israel and hezbollah militants . the future of middle east peace hangs in the balance and all must work towards that goal .
a spokesman for fischer reiterated the german position : " the implementation of the ' road map ' is without an alternative . " defiant israel builds fence , despite un demands shalom arrived in germany a day after the un general assembly passed a tough new resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a controversial security fence , which is located within palestinian territory . the resolution was sponsored by the european union , and all 15 members , including germany , voted to support it in the general assembly .
the vote passed with 144 in favor and 4 against , including the united states and israel .
-lrb- twelve countries abstained . -rrb- the eu agreed to sponsor the resolution after an earlier version proposed by arab governments was toned down .
the compromise text calls on israel to " stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the occupied palestinian territory , " which it says is " in contradiction to relevant provisions of international law . "
the arab government 's resolution proposed turning the matter over to the international court of justice to issue an advisory opinion , which the eu member states objected to . despite the un 's censure , israeli officials , the foreign minister included , say their government wo n't reverse course .
shalom made this position known during his visit to berlin , and back home , israel 's deputy prime minister , ehud olmert , stated the same thing more explicitly .
" the fence will continue being built and we will go on taking care of the security of israel 's citizens , " olmert told israel radio . how can israel continue to go against the will of the majority of the international community , including the will of the eu ?
" israel can and will ignore the latest un resolution for one simple reason : israel can be sure of the usa 's support , " avi primor , the former israeli ambassador to germany told deutsche welle .

last month , police uncovered a plot by several far-right groups to bomb a jewish sight in munich . later wednesday night , shalom met with the german foreign minister joschka fischer , but the two discussed more than the problems of anti-semitism and touched on the mounting crisis in the middle east .
they discussed the eu 's role in dealing with iran , and germany 's role as intermediary in an upcoming hostage exchange between israel and hezbollah militants . the future of middle east peace hangs in the balance and all must work towards that goal .
a spokesman for fischer reiterated the german position : " the implementation of the ' road map ' is without an alternative . " defiant israel builds fence , despite un demands shalom arrived in germany a day after the un general assembly passed a tough new resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a controversial security fence , which is located within palestinian territory . the resolution was sponsored by the european union , and all 15 members , including germany , voted to support it in the general assembly .
the vote passed with 144 in favor and 4 against , including the united states and israel .
-lrb- twelve countries abstained . -rrb- the eu agreed to sponsor the resolution after an earlier version proposed by arab governments was toned down .
the compromise text calls on israel to " stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the occupied palestinian territory , " which it says is " in contradiction to relevant provisions of international law . "
the arab government 's resolution proposed turning the matter over to the international court of justice to issue an advisory opinion , which the eu member states objected to . despite the un 's censure , israeli officials , the foreign minister included , say their government wo n't reverse course .
shalom made this position known during his visit to berlin , and back home , israel 's deputy prime minister , ehud olmert , stated the same thing more explicitly .
" the fence will continue being built and we will go on taking care of the security of israel 's citizens , " olmert told israel radio . how can israel continue to go against the will of the majority of the international community , including the will of the eu ?
" israel can and will ignore the latest un resolution for one simple reason : israel can be sure of the usa 's support , " avi primor , the former israeli ambassador to germany told deutsche welle .

a day after the un passed a resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a security fence , israel 's foreign minister made his first visit to germany and defended his country 's right to security . israeli foreign minister silvan shalom began a three-day visit to germany wednesday with the official purpose of drawing attention to and condemning the rise of anti-semitism in europe and around the world .
but as israeli government officials vowed to press-on with efforts to build a controversial security fence in palestinian territory despite a day-old un resolution - sponsored by the european union - calling on israel to cease and desist , rising tensions in the middle east overshadowed shalom 's visit . speaking during a visit to a former concentration camp north of berlin , the israeli foreign minister defended his government 's hardened stance , stating that , " it is our right to defend our land and our citizens , a right no one can take away from us . " making the rounds in berlin the foreign minister began his visit to germany 's capitol on wednesday by meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder - details of their conversation were not released to the press .
he then travelled to a former concentration camp in sachsenhausen , just north of berlin . laying flowers on the grounds where thousands of jews were killed by the nazis , shalom used the opportunity to warn about the growing threat of anti-semitism in europe and the arab world .
" today , less than 60 years after the holocaust , we are witnesses to a re-sprouting of anti-semitism in europe .
this sprays its poison not just against its traditional goal , jews , but the new anti-semitism is also directed against israel , " he told the crowd . attacks against jews have been on the rise in germany .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .
only when the numbers of exhibitors and visitors to the big computer fairs start rising again will the first tentative signals of growth be cause for celebration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 22.10.2003 compromise or bust for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's first constitution is still just a draft on paper .
european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .
only when the numbers of exhibitors and visitors to the big computer fairs start rising again will the first tentative signals of growth be cause for celebration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .

some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .
german schools have been slower to follow . three states ban advertising outright , but amid steadily shrinking school budgets most allow their schools to rent out ad space as long as it helps them to buy needed materials . " there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .
most teens receive an average monthly allowance of € 80 and spend liberally on clothes and mobile phones , according to a recent study by publishers axel springer and bauer verlag . that 's exactly why teenagers should n't receive more encouragement at school , say some . " there 's enough advertising already , " says susanne levin , a teacher at the falkschule .
" wherever they go , children are encouraged to spend money on things they do n't need , and it does n't need to happen at school too . " state school authorities agree . " fortunately , schools are still a place that can offer an escape from reality , at least in some areas , " said hans-rolf eifer , from the hesse school authority .

european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 22.10.2003 compromise or bust for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's first constitution is still just a draft on paper .
european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .
only when the numbers of exhibitors and visitors to the big computer fairs start rising again will the first tentative signals of growth be cause for celebration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .
the mood is more somber than in previous years -lrb- march 12 , 2003 -rrb- .
feedback munich 's " systems " fair has seen its number of exhibitors fall by more than 50 percent in recent years .

a day after the un passed a resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a security fence , israel 's foreign minister made his first visit to germany and defended his country 's right to security . israeli foreign minister silvan shalom began a three-day visit to germany wednesday with the official purpose of drawing attention to and condemning the rise of anti-semitism in europe and around the world .
but as israeli government officials vowed to press-on with efforts to build a controversial security fence in palestinian territory despite a day-old un resolution - sponsored by the european union - calling on israel to cease and desist , rising tensions in the middle east overshadowed shalom 's visit . speaking during a visit to a former concentration camp north of berlin , the israeli foreign minister defended his government 's hardened stance , stating that , " it is our right to defend our land and our citizens , a right no one can take away from us . " making the rounds in berlin the foreign minister began his visit to germany 's capitol on wednesday by meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder - details of their conversation were not released to the press .
he then travelled to a former concentration camp in sachsenhausen , just north of berlin . laying flowers on the grounds where thousands of jews were killed by the nazis , shalom used the opportunity to warn about the growing threat of anti-semitism in europe and the arab world .
" today , less than 60 years after the holocaust , we are witnesses to a re-sprouting of anti-semitism in europe .
this sprays its poison not just against its traditional goal , jews , but the new anti-semitism is also directed against israel , " he told the crowd . attacks against jews have been on the rise in germany .
last month , police uncovered a plot by several far-right groups to bomb a jewish sight in munich . later wednesday night , shalom met with the german foreign minister joschka fischer , but the two discussed more than the problems of anti-semitism and touched on the mounting crisis in the middle east .
they discussed the eu 's role in dealing with iran , and germany 's role as intermediary in an upcoming hostage exchange between israel and hezbollah militants . the future of middle east peace hangs in the balance and all must work towards that goal .
a spokesman for fischer reiterated the german position : " the implementation of the ' road map ' is without an alternative . " defiant israel builds fence , despite un demands shalom arrived in germany a day after the un general assembly passed a tough new resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a controversial security fence , which is located within palestinian territory . the resolution was sponsored by the european union , and all 15 members , including germany , voted to support it in the general assembly .
the vote passed with 144 in favor and 4 against , including the united states and israel .
-lrb- twelve countries abstained . -rrb- the eu agreed to sponsor the resolution after an earlier version proposed by arab governments was toned down .
the compromise text calls on israel to " stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the occupied palestinian territory , " which it says is " in contradiction to relevant provisions of international law . "
the arab government 's resolution proposed turning the matter over to the international court of justice to issue an advisory opinion , which the eu member states objected to . despite the un 's censure , israeli officials , the foreign minister included , say their government wo n't reverse course .
shalom made this position known during his visit to berlin , and back home , israel 's deputy prime minister , ehud olmert , stated the same thing more explicitly .
" the fence will continue being built and we will go on taking care of the security of israel 's citizens , " olmert told israel radio . how can israel continue to go against the will of the majority of the international community , including the will of the eu ?
" israel can and will ignore the latest un resolution for one simple reason : israel can be sure of the usa 's support , " avi primor , the former israeli ambassador to germany told deutsche welle .

a day after the un passed a resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a security fence , israel 's foreign minister made his first visit to germany and defended his country 's right to security . israeli foreign minister silvan shalom began a three-day visit to germany wednesday with the official purpose of drawing attention to and condemning the rise of anti-semitism in europe and around the world .
but as israeli government officials vowed to press-on with efforts to build a controversial security fence in palestinian territory despite a day-old un resolution - sponsored by the european union - calling on israel to cease and desist , rising tensions in the middle east overshadowed shalom 's visit . speaking during a visit to a former concentration camp north of berlin , the israeli foreign minister defended his government 's hardened stance , stating that , " it is our right to defend our land and our citizens , a right no one can take away from us . " making the rounds in berlin the foreign minister began his visit to germany 's capitol on wednesday by meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder - details of their conversation were not released to the press .
he then travelled to a former concentration camp in sachsenhausen , just north of berlin . laying flowers on the grounds where thousands of jews were killed by the nazis , shalom used the opportunity to warn about the growing threat of anti-semitism in europe and the arab world .
" today , less than 60 years after the holocaust , we are witnesses to a re-sprouting of anti-semitism in europe .
this sprays its poison not just against its traditional goal , jews , but the new anti-semitism is also directed against israel , " he told the crowd . attacks against jews have been on the rise in germany .

they discussed the eu 's role in dealing with iran , and germany 's role as intermediary in an upcoming hostage exchange between israel and hezbollah militants . the future of middle east peace hangs in the balance and all must work towards that goal .

auto giant daimlerchrysler may have posted lousy figures for the third quarter this week , but as 2003 comes to a close it looks like this year will offer the german car industry more than just gloom and doom . with operating profit plummeting 19 percent and sales dropping five percent in the third quarter , things look pretty grim for german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler .
after posting results including a massive net € 1.65 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- loss on tuesday , the world ’ s fifth largest auto company punished with a sinking share price and downgrades galore . as equity analysts ratcheted down their stock price targets for the year , rating agency standard & poor ’ s cut daimlerchrysler ’ s credit rating from bbb + to bbb with a negative outlook , citing how the company continues to be hobbled by its troubled american unit chrysler . although the firm ’ s german mercedes luxury brand continues to sell well , most analysts believe daimlerchrysler can only flourish if it manages to turn things around at the american unit .
daimlerchrysler actually managed to squeeze out a tiny profit at chrysler in the third quarter by cutting costs , but unfortunately the u.s. market remains a vicious place with rebates and other sales incentives . the stuttgart-based daimler-benz has been plagued with problems at chrysler ever since it took over america ’ s number three carmaker in 1998 .
the unit ’ s market share in the united states has dropped from around 16 percent to an estimated 12 percent for this year . “ we interpret management ’ s most recent words and deeds as an indication that a successful revival of chrysler will be postponed ever further into the future , ” analysts from the landesbank baden-württemberg wrote in a report . mixed bag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler concept car 300c but daimlerchrysler ’ s woes aside , this year is shaping up to be a mixed bag for the rest of the german car industry . germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen is expecting 2003 results to be considerably lower than the € 1.8 billion in pre-tax profit it earned last year .
the weak economy in europe and america and the strong euro all helped drag down results for the first half by nearly 58 percent .
it is also slashing 4,000 jobs in brazil , as demand in latin america stagnates . but with the new golf v hitting the market last friday , vw is hoping for a late fourth-quarter surge in sales this year .
volkswagen has already unloaded 33,700 of the new golf in pre-sales and the company hopes to flog around another 100,000 by the end of the year .
in order to meet demand , the company is upping production quotas at its flagship production facilities in wolfsburg . german carmaker opel , owned by u.s. giant general motors , is hoping it can overtake vw for new car registrations in western europe this year .
in the first nine months of 2003 , opel managed to post 1.03 million new registrations .
in comparison , the company ’ s arch-rival volkswagen had 1.09 million in registrations for the same period . investment in the astra , the company ’ s competition for the new golf , reportedly contributed to the € 90 million loss in the third quarter for opel .
but opel still hopes to narrow its losses for all of 2003 compared to last year ’ s € 227 million loss . asian expansion but not all of germany ’ s carmakers are focusing on europe or america in 2003 .

the unit ’ s market share in the united states has dropped from around 16 percent to an estimated 12 percent for this year . “ we interpret management ’ s most recent words and deeds as an indication that a successful revival of chrysler will be postponed ever further into the future , ” analysts from the landesbank baden-württemberg wrote in a report . mixed bag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler concept car 300c but daimlerchrysler ’ s woes aside , this year is shaping up to be a mixed bag for the rest of the german car industry . germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen is expecting 2003 results to be considerably lower than the € 1.8 billion in pre-tax profit it earned last year .
the weak economy in europe and america and the strong euro all helped drag down results for the first half by nearly 58 percent .
it is also slashing 4,000 jobs in brazil , as demand in latin america stagnates . but with the new golf v hitting the market last friday , vw is hoping for a late fourth-quarter surge in sales this year .
volkswagen has already unloaded 33,700 of the new golf in pre-sales and the company hopes to flog around another 100,000 by the end of the year .
in order to meet demand , the company is upping production quotas at its flagship production facilities in wolfsburg . german carmaker opel , owned by u.s. giant general motors , is hoping it can overtake vw for new car registrations in western europe this year .
in the first nine months of 2003 , opel managed to post 1.03 million new registrations .
in comparison , the company ’ s arch-rival volkswagen had 1.09 million in registrations for the same period . investment in the astra , the company ’ s competition for the new golf , reportedly contributed to the € 90 million loss in the third quarter for opel .
but opel still hopes to narrow its losses for all of 2003 compared to last year ’ s € 227 million loss . asian expansion but not all of germany ’ s carmakers are focusing on europe or america in 2003 .
bavaria ’ s upscale bmw is using this year to shift its chinese auto production into high gear .
over the weekend , the company has begun offering the first domestically produced autos in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's helmut panke the german-chinese joint venture sells the bmw 325i model for € 20,000 less than what the import model costs in china .
the lower prices should help spur demand for the estimated 30,000 units bmw plans to roll off the factory lines each year . on wednesday , bmw board member helmut panke in tokyo said the company planned on doubling its sales throughout asia in five years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen pins revival hopes on new golf volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain .

european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .

as yet another shipload of illegal migrants is discovered off southern italy , the pressure increases on eu states to resolve the migration issue . at least 13 people were found dead in a small wooden boat adrift in the mediterranean between north africa and italy , and many more are believed to have died during a strenuous three-week odyssey to europe ’ s shores .
on monday a spokesperson for the italian coastguard , which fished out the 40-foot vessel southeast of the island of lampedusa , said that the pile of decaying corpses and severely emaciated survivors was like something straight out of dante ’ s inferno .
captain stefano valfre , who first sighted the ship drifting near sicily , told reporters that the 15 surviving refugees had said that as many as 100 people had originally boarded the boat , and that they had thrown the bodies of the dead overboard , until they had become too weak to do even that .
the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .
although italy has been most recentlyaeffected by the ceaseless wave of refugees lapping at its door , the problem is one that all of europe faces .
europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "
a non-quantifiable figure bodies such as the international center for migration policy development -lrb- icmpd -rrb- estimate that the population of europe is rising by up to one million a year , including illegal migration , but stress that the phenomenon is not statistically quantifiable .
each year , hundreds of thousands slip through europe 's borders and wash up its shores , unobserved and uncounted .
and as the eu expands eastwards and its borders touch those of states such as the ukraine and russia , where human trafficking is already a known problem , many in the european commission fear europe will be overwhelmed with even more illegal migrants .
" fortress europe " with seemingly more urgency than ever , the interior ministers from france , germany , britain , italy and spain forged ahead with their plans for toughening up their border security .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy proposed the creation of a " european security zone " for protection against illegal immigration via the mediterranean sea , which would be patrolled both along the european and african coast .
the five ministers discussed a " three plus three " cooperation deal involving france , italy and spain sponsoring efforts in algeria , morocco and tunisia to halt the exodus of clandestine migrants .
the " big five " also announced they had agreed to boost police cooperation , reforming the collective eu police agency europol , clamping down on gangs dealing in human trafficking , and putting microchips on visas for the eu 's schengen area that would include fingerprints and face-scans in digital form .
nicolas sarkozy rejected suggestions the eu was being turned into " fortress europe , " reducing the numbers arriving by making migrants ' chances of entry less and less likely .
national sensitivities last week , a number of eu states resisted a plan to introduce quotas on legal immigration , expressing doubts about how it could work in practice .
the scheme foresaw decisions made at a national level on how many people to admit and from which country , with the european commission assuming a coordinating function .
for now , the amsterdam treaty , which came into force on may 1 , 1999 , provides the legal basis for a common european union immigration policy .
the deadline for a new common asylum and migration policy is set for may 2004 .
but with eu states still wrangling over the border management agency which would coordinate existing centers responsible for border control and the migration issue still a sticking point in the first european constitution , it seems that when it comes to migration , most countries are unwilling to hand over the decision-making to brussels .
the pressure on governments to cooperate is considerable .
spanish interior minister angel acebes pointed out in la baule that " we will be forced , sooner or later , to share a part of the cost , because if a member of the european community does not defend its borders , then we will all pay for the consequences .

as yet another shipload of illegal migrants is discovered off southern italy , the pressure increases on eu states to resolve the migration issue . at least 13 people were found dead in a small wooden boat adrift in the mediterranean between north africa and italy , and many more are believed to have died during a strenuous three-week odyssey to europe ’ s shores .
on monday a spokesperson for the italian coastguard , which fished out the 40-foot vessel southeast of the island of lampedusa , said that the pile of decaying corpses and severely emaciated survivors was like something straight out of dante ’ s inferno .
captain stefano valfre , who first sighted the ship drifting near sicily , told reporters that the 15 surviving refugees had said that as many as 100 people had originally boarded the boat , and that they had thrown the bodies of the dead overboard , until they had become too weak to do even that .
the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .
although italy has been most recentlyaeffected by the ceaseless wave of refugees lapping at its door , the problem is one that all of europe faces .
europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "
a non-quantifiable figure bodies such as the international center for migration policy development -lrb- icmpd -rrb- estimate that the population of europe is rising by up to one million a year , including illegal migration , but stress that the phenomenon is not statistically quantifiable .
each year , hundreds of thousands slip through europe 's borders and wash up its shores , unobserved and uncounted .
and as the eu expands eastwards and its borders touch those of states such as the ukraine and russia , where human trafficking is already a known problem , many in the european commission fear europe will be overwhelmed with even more illegal migrants .
" fortress europe " with seemingly more urgency than ever , the interior ministers from france , germany , britain , italy and spain forged ahead with their plans for toughening up their border security .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy proposed the creation of a " european security zone " for protection against illegal immigration via the mediterranean sea , which would be patrolled both along the european and african coast .
the five ministers discussed a " three plus three " cooperation deal involving france , italy and spain sponsoring efforts in algeria , morocco and tunisia to halt the exodus of clandestine migrants .
the " big five " also announced they had agreed to boost police cooperation , reforming the collective eu police agency europol , clamping down on gangs dealing in human trafficking , and putting microchips on visas for the eu 's schengen area that would include fingerprints and face-scans in digital form .
nicolas sarkozy rejected suggestions the eu was being turned into " fortress europe , " reducing the numbers arriving by making migrants ' chances of entry less and less likely .
national sensitivities last week , a number of eu states resisted a plan to introduce quotas on legal immigration , expressing doubts about how it could work in practice .
the scheme foresaw decisions made at a national level on how many people to admit and from which country , with the european commission assuming a coordinating function .
for now , the amsterdam treaty , which came into force on may 1 , 1999 , provides the legal basis for a common european union immigration policy .
the deadline for a new common asylum and migration policy is set for may 2004 .

the pressure on governments to cooperate is considerable .

the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .
although italy has been most recentlyaeffected by the ceaseless wave of refugees lapping at its door , the problem is one that all of europe faces .
europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "
a non-quantifiable figure bodies such as the international center for migration policy development -lrb- icmpd -rrb- estimate that the population of europe is rising by up to one million a year , including illegal migration , but stress that the phenomenon is not statistically quantifiable .
each year , hundreds of thousands slip through europe 's borders and wash up its shores , unobserved and uncounted .
and as the eu expands eastwards and its borders touch those of states such as the ukraine and russia , where human trafficking is already a known problem , many in the european commission fear europe will be overwhelmed with even more illegal migrants .
" fortress europe " with seemingly more urgency than ever , the interior ministers from france , germany , britain , italy and spain forged ahead with their plans for toughening up their border security .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy proposed the creation of a " european security zone " for protection against illegal immigration via the mediterranean sea , which would be patrolled both along the european and african coast .
the five ministers discussed a " three plus three " cooperation deal involving france , italy and spain sponsoring efforts in algeria , morocco and tunisia to halt the exodus of clandestine migrants .
the " big five " also announced they had agreed to boost police cooperation , reforming the collective eu police agency europol , clamping down on gangs dealing in human trafficking , and putting microchips on visas for the eu 's schengen area that would include fingerprints and face-scans in digital form .
nicolas sarkozy rejected suggestions the eu was being turned into " fortress europe , " reducing the numbers arriving by making migrants ' chances of entry less and less likely .
national sensitivities last week , a number of eu states resisted a plan to introduce quotas on legal immigration , expressing doubts about how it could work in practice .
the scheme foresaw decisions made at a national level on how many people to admit and from which country , with the european commission assuming a coordinating function .
for now , the amsterdam treaty , which came into force on may 1 , 1999 , provides the legal basis for a common european union immigration policy .
the deadline for a new common asylum and migration policy is set for may 2004 .
but with eu states still wrangling over the border management agency which would coordinate existing centers responsible for border control and the migration issue still a sticking point in the first european constitution , it seems that when it comes to migration , most countries are unwilling to hand over the decision-making to brussels .
the pressure on governments to cooperate is considerable .

some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .
german schools have been slower to follow . three states ban advertising outright , but amid steadily shrinking school budgets most allow their schools to rent out ad space as long as it helps them to buy needed materials . " there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .
most teens receive an average monthly allowance of € 80 and spend liberally on clothes and mobile phones , according to a recent study by publishers axel springer and bauer verlag . that 's exactly why teenagers should n't receive more encouragement at school , say some . " there 's enough advertising already , " says susanne levin , a teacher at the falkschule .
" wherever they go , children are encouraged to spend money on things they do n't need , and it does n't need to happen at school too . " state school authorities agree . " fortunately , schools are still a place that can offer an escape from reality , at least in some areas , " said hans-rolf eifer , from the hesse school authority .

teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .

" there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .
only when the numbers of exhibitors and visitors to the big computer fairs start rising again will the first tentative signals of growth be cause for celebration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .
only when the numbers of exhibitors and visitors to the big computer fairs start rising again will the first tentative signals of growth be cause for celebration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .

some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .
german schools have been slower to follow . three states ban advertising outright , but amid steadily shrinking school budgets most allow their schools to rent out ad space as long as it helps them to buy needed materials . " there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .
most teens receive an average monthly allowance of € 80 and spend liberally on clothes and mobile phones , according to a recent study by publishers axel springer and bauer verlag . that 's exactly why teenagers should n't receive more encouragement at school , say some . " there 's enough advertising already , " says susanne levin , a teacher at the falkschule .
" wherever they go , children are encouraged to spend money on things they do n't need , and it does n't need to happen at school too . " state school authorities agree . " fortunately , schools are still a place that can offer an escape from reality , at least in some areas , " said hans-rolf eifer , from the hesse school authority .

european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .
only when the numbers of exhibitors and visitors to the big computer fairs start rising again will the first tentative signals of growth be cause for celebration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .

some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .

teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 22.10.2003 compromise or bust for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's first constitution is still just a draft on paper .
european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

as yet another shipload of illegal migrants is discovered off southern italy , the pressure increases on eu states to resolve the migration issue . at least 13 people were found dead in a small wooden boat adrift in the mediterranean between north africa and italy , and many more are believed to have died during a strenuous three-week odyssey to europe ’ s shores .
on monday a spokesperson for the italian coastguard , which fished out the 40-foot vessel southeast of the island of lampedusa , said that the pile of decaying corpses and severely emaciated survivors was like something straight out of dante ’ s inferno .
captain stefano valfre , who first sighted the ship drifting near sicily , told reporters that the 15 surviving refugees had said that as many as 100 people had originally boarded the boat , and that they had thrown the bodies of the dead overboard , until they had become too weak to do even that .
the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .
although italy has been most recentlyaeffected by the ceaseless wave of refugees lapping at its door , the problem is one that all of europe faces .
europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "
a non-quantifiable figure bodies such as the international center for migration policy development -lrb- icmpd -rrb- estimate that the population of europe is rising by up to one million a year , including illegal migration , but stress that the phenomenon is not statistically quantifiable .
each year , hundreds of thousands slip through europe 's borders and wash up its shores , unobserved and uncounted .
and as the eu expands eastwards and its borders touch those of states such as the ukraine and russia , where human trafficking is already a known problem , many in the european commission fear europe will be overwhelmed with even more illegal migrants .
" fortress europe " with seemingly more urgency than ever , the interior ministers from france , germany , britain , italy and spain forged ahead with their plans for toughening up their border security .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy proposed the creation of a " european security zone " for protection against illegal immigration via the mediterranean sea , which would be patrolled both along the european and african coast .
the five ministers discussed a " three plus three " cooperation deal involving france , italy and spain sponsoring efforts in algeria , morocco and tunisia to halt the exodus of clandestine migrants .
the " big five " also announced they had agreed to boost police cooperation , reforming the collective eu police agency europol , clamping down on gangs dealing in human trafficking , and putting microchips on visas for the eu 's schengen area that would include fingerprints and face-scans in digital form .
nicolas sarkozy rejected suggestions the eu was being turned into " fortress europe , " reducing the numbers arriving by making migrants ' chances of entry less and less likely .
national sensitivities last week , a number of eu states resisted a plan to introduce quotas on legal immigration , expressing doubts about how it could work in practice .
the scheme foresaw decisions made at a national level on how many people to admit and from which country , with the european commission assuming a coordinating function .
for now , the amsterdam treaty , which came into force on may 1 , 1999 , provides the legal basis for a common european union immigration policy .
the deadline for a new common asylum and migration policy is set for may 2004 .
but with eu states still wrangling over the border management agency which would coordinate existing centers responsible for border control and the migration issue still a sticking point in the first european constitution , it seems that when it comes to migration , most countries are unwilling to hand over the decision-making to brussels .
the pressure on governments to cooperate is considerable .

as yet another shipload of illegal migrants is discovered off southern italy , the pressure increases on eu states to resolve the migration issue . at least 13 people were found dead in a small wooden boat adrift in the mediterranean between north africa and italy , and many more are believed to have died during a strenuous three-week odyssey to europe ’ s shores .
on monday a spokesperson for the italian coastguard , which fished out the 40-foot vessel southeast of the island of lampedusa , said that the pile of decaying corpses and severely emaciated survivors was like something straight out of dante ’ s inferno .
captain stefano valfre , who first sighted the ship drifting near sicily , told reporters that the 15 surviving refugees had said that as many as 100 people had originally boarded the boat , and that they had thrown the bodies of the dead overboard , until they had become too weak to do even that .
the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .
although italy has been most recentlyaeffected by the ceaseless wave of refugees lapping at its door , the problem is one that all of europe faces .
europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 22.10.2003 compromise or bust for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's first constitution is still just a draft on paper .
european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .
they failed to resolve differences over the draft constitution and tensions over the future of european defense flared .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .
only when the numbers of exhibitors and visitors to the big computer fairs start rising again will the first tentative signals of growth be cause for celebration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cebit opens amid mixture of fear and hope the world 's largest information and telecommunications technology trade fair , cebit , opened in hanover on tuesday .

a day after the un passed a resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a security fence , israel 's foreign minister made his first visit to germany and defended his country 's right to security . israeli foreign minister silvan shalom began a three-day visit to germany wednesday with the official purpose of drawing attention to and condemning the rise of anti-semitism in europe and around the world .
but as israeli government officials vowed to press-on with efforts to build a controversial security fence in palestinian territory despite a day-old un resolution - sponsored by the european union - calling on israel to cease and desist , rising tensions in the middle east overshadowed shalom 's visit . speaking during a visit to a former concentration camp north of berlin , the israeli foreign minister defended his government 's hardened stance , stating that , " it is our right to defend our land and our citizens , a right no one can take away from us . " making the rounds in berlin the foreign minister began his visit to germany 's capitol on wednesday by meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder - details of their conversation were not released to the press .
he then travelled to a former concentration camp in sachsenhausen , just north of berlin . laying flowers on the grounds where thousands of jews were killed by the nazis , shalom used the opportunity to warn about the growing threat of anti-semitism in europe and the arab world .
" today , less than 60 years after the holocaust , we are witnesses to a re-sprouting of anti-semitism in europe .
this sprays its poison not just against its traditional goal , jews , but the new anti-semitism is also directed against israel , " he told the crowd . attacks against jews have been on the rise in germany .
last month , police uncovered a plot by several far-right groups to bomb a jewish sight in munich . later wednesday night , shalom met with the german foreign minister joschka fischer , but the two discussed more than the problems of anti-semitism and touched on the mounting crisis in the middle east .
they discussed the eu 's role in dealing with iran , and germany 's role as intermediary in an upcoming hostage exchange between israel and hezbollah militants . the future of middle east peace hangs in the balance and all must work towards that goal .
a spokesman for fischer reiterated the german position : " the implementation of the ' road map ' is without an alternative . " defiant israel builds fence , despite un demands shalom arrived in germany a day after the un general assembly passed a tough new resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a controversial security fence , which is located within palestinian territory . the resolution was sponsored by the european union , and all 15 members , including germany , voted to support it in the general assembly .
the vote passed with 144 in favor and 4 against , including the united states and israel .
-lrb- twelve countries abstained . -rrb- the eu agreed to sponsor the resolution after an earlier version proposed by arab governments was toned down .
the compromise text calls on israel to " stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the occupied palestinian territory , " which it says is " in contradiction to relevant provisions of international law . "
the arab government 's resolution proposed turning the matter over to the international court of justice to issue an advisory opinion , which the eu member states objected to . despite the un 's censure , israeli officials , the foreign minister included , say their government wo n't reverse course .
shalom made this position known during his visit to berlin , and back home , israel 's deputy prime minister , ehud olmert , stated the same thing more explicitly .
" the fence will continue being built and we will go on taking care of the security of israel 's citizens , " olmert told israel radio . how can israel continue to go against the will of the majority of the international community , including the will of the eu ?
" israel can and will ignore the latest un resolution for one simple reason : israel can be sure of the usa 's support , " avi primor , the former israeli ambassador to germany told deutsche welle .

some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .
german schools have been slower to follow . three states ban advertising outright , but amid steadily shrinking school budgets most allow their schools to rent out ad space as long as it helps them to buy needed materials . " there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .
most teens receive an average monthly allowance of € 80 and spend liberally on clothes and mobile phones , according to a recent study by publishers axel springer and bauer verlag . that 's exactly why teenagers should n't receive more encouragement at school , say some . " there 's enough advertising already , " says susanne levin , a teacher at the falkschule .
" wherever they go , children are encouraged to spend money on things they do n't need , and it does n't need to happen at school too . " state school authorities agree . " fortunately , schools are still a place that can offer an escape from reality , at least in some areas , " said hans-rolf eifer , from the hesse school authority .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .

a day after the un passed a resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a security fence , israel 's foreign minister made his first visit to germany and defended his country 's right to security . israeli foreign minister silvan shalom began a three-day visit to germany wednesday with the official purpose of drawing attention to and condemning the rise of anti-semitism in europe and around the world .
but as israeli government officials vowed to press-on with efforts to build a controversial security fence in palestinian territory despite a day-old un resolution - sponsored by the european union - calling on israel to cease and desist , rising tensions in the middle east overshadowed shalom 's visit . speaking during a visit to a former concentration camp north of berlin , the israeli foreign minister defended his government 's hardened stance , stating that , " it is our right to defend our land and our citizens , a right no one can take away from us . " making the rounds in berlin the foreign minister began his visit to germany 's capitol on wednesday by meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder - details of their conversation were not released to the press .
he then travelled to a former concentration camp in sachsenhausen , just north of berlin . laying flowers on the grounds where thousands of jews were killed by the nazis , shalom used the opportunity to warn about the growing threat of anti-semitism in europe and the arab world .
" today , less than 60 years after the holocaust , we are witnesses to a re-sprouting of anti-semitism in europe .
this sprays its poison not just against its traditional goal , jews , but the new anti-semitism is also directed against israel , " he told the crowd . attacks against jews have been on the rise in germany .
last month , police uncovered a plot by several far-right groups to bomb a jewish sight in munich . later wednesday night , shalom met with the german foreign minister joschka fischer , but the two discussed more than the problems of anti-semitism and touched on the mounting crisis in the middle east .
they discussed the eu 's role in dealing with iran , and germany 's role as intermediary in an upcoming hostage exchange between israel and hezbollah militants . the future of middle east peace hangs in the balance and all must work towards that goal .
a spokesman for fischer reiterated the german position : " the implementation of the ' road map ' is without an alternative . " defiant israel builds fence , despite un demands shalom arrived in germany a day after the un general assembly passed a tough new resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a controversial security fence , which is located within palestinian territory . the resolution was sponsored by the european union , and all 15 members , including germany , voted to support it in the general assembly .
the vote passed with 144 in favor and 4 against , including the united states and israel .
-lrb- twelve countries abstained . -rrb- the eu agreed to sponsor the resolution after an earlier version proposed by arab governments was toned down .
the compromise text calls on israel to " stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the occupied palestinian territory , " which it says is " in contradiction to relevant provisions of international law . "
the arab government 's resolution proposed turning the matter over to the international court of justice to issue an advisory opinion , which the eu member states objected to . despite the un 's censure , israeli officials , the foreign minister included , say their government wo n't reverse course .
shalom made this position known during his visit to berlin , and back home , israel 's deputy prime minister , ehud olmert , stated the same thing more explicitly .
" the fence will continue being built and we will go on taking care of the security of israel 's citizens , " olmert told israel radio . how can israel continue to go against the will of the majority of the international community , including the will of the eu ?

auto giant daimlerchrysler may have posted lousy figures for the third quarter this week , but as 2003 comes to a close it looks like this year will offer the german car industry more than just gloom and doom . with operating profit plummeting 19 percent and sales dropping five percent in the third quarter , things look pretty grim for german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler .
after posting results including a massive net € 1.65 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- loss on tuesday , the world ’ s fifth largest auto company punished with a sinking share price and downgrades galore . as equity analysts ratcheted down their stock price targets for the year , rating agency standard & poor ’ s cut daimlerchrysler ’ s credit rating from bbb + to bbb with a negative outlook , citing how the company continues to be hobbled by its troubled american unit chrysler . although the firm ’ s german mercedes luxury brand continues to sell well , most analysts believe daimlerchrysler can only flourish if it manages to turn things around at the american unit .
daimlerchrysler actually managed to squeeze out a tiny profit at chrysler in the third quarter by cutting costs , but unfortunately the u.s. market remains a vicious place with rebates and other sales incentives . the stuttgart-based daimler-benz has been plagued with problems at chrysler ever since it took over america ’ s number three carmaker in 1998 .
the unit ’ s market share in the united states has dropped from around 16 percent to an estimated 12 percent for this year . “ we interpret management ’ s most recent words and deeds as an indication that a successful revival of chrysler will be postponed ever further into the future , ” analysts from the landesbank baden-württemberg wrote in a report . mixed bag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler concept car 300c but daimlerchrysler ’ s woes aside , this year is shaping up to be a mixed bag for the rest of the german car industry . germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen is expecting 2003 results to be considerably lower than the € 1.8 billion in pre-tax profit it earned last year .
the weak economy in europe and america and the strong euro all helped drag down results for the first half by nearly 58 percent .
it is also slashing 4,000 jobs in brazil , as demand in latin america stagnates . but with the new golf v hitting the market last friday , vw is hoping for a late fourth-quarter surge in sales this year .
volkswagen has already unloaded 33,700 of the new golf in pre-sales and the company hopes to flog around another 100,000 by the end of the year .
in order to meet demand , the company is upping production quotas at its flagship production facilities in wolfsburg . german carmaker opel , owned by u.s. giant general motors , is hoping it can overtake vw for new car registrations in western europe this year .
in the first nine months of 2003 , opel managed to post 1.03 million new registrations .
in comparison , the company ’ s arch-rival volkswagen had 1.09 million in registrations for the same period . investment in the astra , the company ’ s competition for the new golf , reportedly contributed to the € 90 million loss in the third quarter for opel .

some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .
wishful thinking for many such talk is nothing more than wishful thinking .
the words have been said so many times that they ’ ve begun to lose their meaning , and still nothing ever changes .
so despite bitkom ’ s optimistic forecast , few exhibitors at systems will allow talk of the future to get in the way of what they need to do : focus on the bottom line and sell as many of their product as they can .

like cebit , systems 2003 in munich is suffering from low turnout of companies .
despite a decline in the number of presenters at the " systems " fair in munich , germany ’ s second largest computer trade exhibit after cebit , industry experts are cautiously optimistic that things are improving . this year there were only 1,300 companies represented at " systems , " 300 fewer than last year .
but that ’ s peanuts compared to the some 3,000 exhibitors who attended the computer trade fair during the boom years of the late ' 90s .
the trend is clear : during these lean years of the post-new economy boom and bust , germany ’ s high-tech trade fairs are suffering a decline in popularity .
just this week , the country ’ s largest computer fair and arguably the world 's biggest , cebit in hanover , received notice that hewlett-packard would no longer have its own stand next year .
the american computer company is following in the footsteps of other major international corporations who have decided to steer away from big , expensive exhibitions on the german computer fair circuit .
during tough economic times such as these , it companies want to focus hard on the bottom line and exhibit attendance - which used to score high in terms of marketing - just isn ’ t as important as it once was .
at cebit , for instance , the last two years have seen a continual decline in both exhibitors and visitors .
but that may all be a thing of the past , if the industry experts at " systems " are to be believed .
turning point for it sector according to the federal association for information technology , telecommunication and new media , bitkom for short , germany ’ s it sector can look ahead to a period of cautious growth .
the head of the sector ’ s largest umbrella organization , bernard rohleder , told reporters at the opening of systems in munich on monday that after " enduring three years of bad weather " in which growth dropped to a negative 2.7 percent , this year ’ s zero percent growth shows a break in the downwards trend .
" next year we can expect growth of about 2 percent , " he said .
although still miles from the two-digit growth rates of the late ' 90s , the optimistic forecast was greeted with relief from the exhibitors gathered in bavaria ’ s capital .
" we have broken the trend , " rohleder said summing up their sentiments .
but bitkom ’ s prognosis also came with a warning attached : unless the current economic and political circumstances in germany improve significantly , there will be no sustainable growth .
no amount of reform patches will help get germany back on the right track , the bitkom president said .
what the country needs is a complete break with the current welfare system , an entirely new direction for the country , rohleder explained .
" we need to develop new products , new solutions , and we need to become more innovative , " he said .
" the problems in the social welfare system and unemployment will be solved automatically when germany becomes successful on the world market . "
encouraging innovation unless germany does more to improve its position in the development of technological innovation , the it sector will never fully recover and germany will lose out in global competition in the long run , bitkom 's head said .
for this reason the government must take an active role in supporting companies ’ quest for innovation .
and the key to promoting innovation is a modern education system that addresses the demands of a rapidly changing society .
germany needs talented young engineers and scientists .
according to bitkom studies , in the coming years there will be a dearth of 13,000 electrical technicians alone in germany .
such an absence makes itself felt not only in the domestic labor market , but internationally when germany is no longer able to compete against countries like china and india , which are churning out highly skilled workers and it professionals at a much higher level .
but industry experts haven ’ t given up all hope on germany yet .
in a few years time , germany could still turn itself around and develop into the number one country for technological innovation .
all it takes is for political and economic forces to be mobilized towards the single goal of pulling germany up out of its current doldrums , rohleder stressed .

a day after the un passed a resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a security fence , israel 's foreign minister made his first visit to germany and defended his country 's right to security . israeli foreign minister silvan shalom began a three-day visit to germany wednesday with the official purpose of drawing attention to and condemning the rise of anti-semitism in europe and around the world .
but as israeli government officials vowed to press-on with efforts to build a controversial security fence in palestinian territory despite a day-old un resolution - sponsored by the european union - calling on israel to cease and desist , rising tensions in the middle east overshadowed shalom 's visit . speaking during a visit to a former concentration camp north of berlin , the israeli foreign minister defended his government 's hardened stance , stating that , " it is our right to defend our land and our citizens , a right no one can take away from us . " making the rounds in berlin the foreign minister began his visit to germany 's capitol on wednesday by meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder - details of their conversation were not released to the press .
he then travelled to a former concentration camp in sachsenhausen , just north of berlin . laying flowers on the grounds where thousands of jews were killed by the nazis , shalom used the opportunity to warn about the growing threat of anti-semitism in europe and the arab world .
" today , less than 60 years after the holocaust , we are witnesses to a re-sprouting of anti-semitism in europe .
this sprays its poison not just against its traditional goal , jews , but the new anti-semitism is also directed against israel , " he told the crowd . attacks against jews have been on the rise in germany .
last month , police uncovered a plot by several far-right groups to bomb a jewish sight in munich . later wednesday night , shalom met with the german foreign minister joschka fischer , but the two discussed more than the problems of anti-semitism and touched on the mounting crisis in the middle east .
they discussed the eu 's role in dealing with iran , and germany 's role as intermediary in an upcoming hostage exchange between israel and hezbollah militants . the future of middle east peace hangs in the balance and all must work towards that goal .
a spokesman for fischer reiterated the german position : " the implementation of the ' road map ' is without an alternative . " defiant israel builds fence , despite un demands shalom arrived in germany a day after the un general assembly passed a tough new resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a controversial security fence , which is located within palestinian territory . the resolution was sponsored by the european union , and all 15 members , including germany , voted to support it in the general assembly .
the vote passed with 144 in favor and 4 against , including the united states and israel .
-lrb- twelve countries abstained . -rrb- the eu agreed to sponsor the resolution after an earlier version proposed by arab governments was toned down .
the compromise text calls on israel to " stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the occupied palestinian territory , " which it says is " in contradiction to relevant provisions of international law . "
the arab government 's resolution proposed turning the matter over to the international court of justice to issue an advisory opinion , which the eu member states objected to . despite the un 's censure , israeli officials , the foreign minister included , say their government wo n't reverse course .
shalom made this position known during his visit to berlin , and back home , israel 's deputy prime minister , ehud olmert , stated the same thing more explicitly .
" the fence will continue being built and we will go on taking care of the security of israel 's citizens , " olmert told israel radio . how can israel continue to go against the will of the majority of the international community , including the will of the eu ?

the unit ’ s market share in the united states has dropped from around 16 percent to an estimated 12 percent for this year . “ we interpret management ’ s most recent words and deeds as an indication that a successful revival of chrysler will be postponed ever further into the future , ” analysts from the landesbank baden-württemberg wrote in a report . mixed bag bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler concept car 300c but daimlerchrysler ’ s woes aside , this year is shaping up to be a mixed bag for the rest of the german car industry . germany ’ s largest automaker volkswagen is expecting 2003 results to be considerably lower than the € 1.8 billion in pre-tax profit it earned last year .
the weak economy in europe and america and the strong euro all helped drag down results for the first half by nearly 58 percent .
it is also slashing 4,000 jobs in brazil , as demand in latin america stagnates . but with the new golf v hitting the market last friday , vw is hoping for a late fourth-quarter surge in sales this year .
volkswagen has already unloaded 33,700 of the new golf in pre-sales and the company hopes to flog around another 100,000 by the end of the year .
in order to meet demand , the company is upping production quotas at its flagship production facilities in wolfsburg . german carmaker opel , owned by u.s. giant general motors , is hoping it can overtake vw for new car registrations in western europe this year .
in the first nine months of 2003 , opel managed to post 1.03 million new registrations .
in comparison , the company ’ s arch-rival volkswagen had 1.09 million in registrations for the same period . investment in the astra , the company ’ s competition for the new golf , reportedly contributed to the € 90 million loss in the third quarter for opel .
but opel still hopes to narrow its losses for all of 2003 compared to last year ’ s € 227 million loss . asian expansion but not all of germany ’ s carmakers are focusing on europe or america in 2003 .
bavaria ’ s upscale bmw is using this year to shift its chinese auto production into high gear .
over the weekend , the company has begun offering the first domestically produced autos in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's helmut panke the german-chinese joint venture sells the bmw 325i model for € 20,000 less than what the import model costs in china .
the lower prices should help spur demand for the estimated 30,000 units bmw plans to roll off the factory lines each year . on wednesday , bmw board member helmut panke in tokyo said the company planned on doubling its sales throughout asia in five years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen pins revival hopes on new golf volkswagen unveiled the fifth-generation golf on monday in a dramatic display of lights , mist and optimistic sales forecasts .
however , once the smoke has cleared , heavy expectation will remain .
-lrb- august 26 , 2003 -rrb- daimlerchrysler turns five out of the merger of germany 's daimler-benz and the u.s. carmaker chrysler came daimlerchrysler in 1998 .

as yet another shipload of illegal migrants is discovered off southern italy , the pressure increases on eu states to resolve the migration issue . at least 13 people were found dead in a small wooden boat adrift in the mediterranean between north africa and italy , and many more are believed to have died during a strenuous three-week odyssey to europe ’ s shores .
on monday a spokesperson for the italian coastguard , which fished out the 40-foot vessel southeast of the island of lampedusa , said that the pile of decaying corpses and severely emaciated survivors was like something straight out of dante ’ s inferno .
captain stefano valfre , who first sighted the ship drifting near sicily , told reporters that the 15 surviving refugees had said that as many as 100 people had originally boarded the boat , and that they had thrown the bodies of the dead overboard , until they had become too weak to do even that .
the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .

europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "

" fortress europe " with seemingly more urgency than ever , the interior ministers from france , germany , britain , italy and spain forged ahead with their plans for toughening up their border security .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy proposed the creation of a " european security zone " for protection against illegal immigration via the mediterranean sea , which would be patrolled both along the european and african coast .
the five ministers discussed a " three plus three " cooperation deal involving france , italy and spain sponsoring efforts in algeria , morocco and tunisia to halt the exodus of clandestine migrants .
the " big five " also announced they had agreed to boost police cooperation , reforming the collective eu police agency europol , clamping down on gangs dealing in human trafficking , and putting microchips on visas for the eu 's schengen area that would include fingerprints and face-scans in digital form .
nicolas sarkozy rejected suggestions the eu was being turned into " fortress europe , " reducing the numbers arriving by making migrants ' chances of entry less and less likely .
national sensitivities last week , a number of eu states resisted a plan to introduce quotas on legal immigration , expressing doubts about how it could work in practice .
the scheme foresaw decisions made at a national level on how many people to admit and from which country , with the european commission assuming a coordinating function .
for now , the amsterdam treaty , which came into force on may 1 , 1999 , provides the legal basis for a common european union immigration policy .

as yet another shipload of illegal migrants is discovered off southern italy , the pressure increases on eu states to resolve the migration issue . at least 13 people were found dead in a small wooden boat adrift in the mediterranean between north africa and italy , and many more are believed to have died during a strenuous three-week odyssey to europe ’ s shores .
on monday a spokesperson for the italian coastguard , which fished out the 40-foot vessel southeast of the island of lampedusa , said that the pile of decaying corpses and severely emaciated survivors was like something straight out of dante ’ s inferno .
captain stefano valfre , who first sighted the ship drifting near sicily , told reporters that the 15 surviving refugees had said that as many as 100 people had originally boarded the boat , and that they had thrown the bodies of the dead overboard , until they had become too weak to do even that .
the incident , the second to have hit italy in just a few days , draws attention to the plight of illegal migrants heading for europe .
although italy has been most recentlyaeffected by the ceaseless wave of refugees lapping at its door , the problem is one that all of europe faces .
europe dogged by migrant problem last week , spanish authorities detained over 550 migrants trying to reach european shores in 12 boats .
and in september , seven illegal migrants thought to be from pakistan were killed by landmines as they attempted to cross from turkey into greece - where every year tens of thousands are smuggled over to europe from countries such as turkey , kosovo and bosnia and herzegovina .
the recent surge in illegal arrivals along europe 's southern shores brought the question of migration control into especially sharp focus at the meeting of eu interior ministers currently being held in la baule , france .
during the talks which focussed on migration and terrorism , italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu described the latest incident as " a human tragedy that weighed , above all , on europe 's civil conscience . "
but he also urged african states to do more to stem the flood of migrants in search of a better life in europe , adding that " it puts in the spotlight african governments who are doing nothing to control this exodus . "
a non-quantifiable figure bodies such as the international center for migration policy development -lrb- icmpd -rrb- estimate that the population of europe is rising by up to one million a year , including illegal migration , but stress that the phenomenon is not statistically quantifiable .
each year , hundreds of thousands slip through europe 's borders and wash up its shores , unobserved and uncounted .
and as the eu expands eastwards and its borders touch those of states such as the ukraine and russia , where human trafficking is already a known problem , many in the european commission fear europe will be overwhelmed with even more illegal migrants .
" fortress europe " with seemingly more urgency than ever , the interior ministers from france , germany , britain , italy and spain forged ahead with their plans for toughening up their border security .
french interior minister nicolas sarkozy proposed the creation of a " european security zone " for protection against illegal immigration via the mediterranean sea , which would be patrolled both along the european and african coast .
the five ministers discussed a " three plus three " cooperation deal involving france , italy and spain sponsoring efforts in algeria , morocco and tunisia to halt the exodus of clandestine migrants .
the " big five " also announced they had agreed to boost police cooperation , reforming the collective eu police agency europol , clamping down on gangs dealing in human trafficking , and putting microchips on visas for the eu 's schengen area that would include fingerprints and face-scans in digital form .
nicolas sarkozy rejected suggestions the eu was being turned into " fortress europe , " reducing the numbers arriving by making migrants ' chances of entry less and less likely .
national sensitivities last week , a number of eu states resisted a plan to introduce quotas on legal immigration , expressing doubts about how it could work in practice .
the scheme foresaw decisions made at a national level on how many people to admit and from which country , with the european commission assuming a coordinating function .
for now , the amsterdam treaty , which came into force on may 1 , 1999 , provides the legal basis for a common european union immigration policy .
the deadline for a new common asylum and migration policy is set for may 2004 .
but with eu states still wrangling over the border management agency which would coordinate existing centers responsible for border control and the migration issue still a sticking point in the first european constitution , it seems that when it comes to migration , most countries are unwilling to hand over the decision-making to brussels .
the pressure on governments to cooperate is considerable .

european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis . european commission president romano prodi told the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday that if the problematic eu constitution is to be agreed upon in december as planned then the members must find a compromise by mid-november .
referring to the eu summit meeting last week where european leaders met to discuss the problems surrounding the draft constitution , prodi said , " i have to say that the european council did not make much progress ...
if a constitution is to be approved by december , it is vital for the presidency to come forward by mid-november with clear proposals that can meet with consensus . "
prodi said that there were very few points where the draft constitution needed changing and added that consensus on the draft would lead to a stronger future for all within the eu .
more disagreements would lead to a eu crisis , he implied .
constitution would strengthen eu " the european union needs a sound constitution .
only a sound constitution can enable the european union to play its role properly in europe and the world . "
the draft constitution - designed to streamline decision-making within the eu after it expands to from 15 to 25 members next may - was painfully born out over 16 months of hard bargaining by a forum of eu ministers and parliamentarians led by former french president valerie giscard d 'estaing .
the constitution will determine who holds power in the expanded eu and clear differences remain between individual governments over the voting rights the draft allocates to them , the way it slims down the bloc 's executive branch - the european commission - and on the eu 's future security and defense policy .
italians propose compromise package earlier in the day , as if to pre-empt prodi 's call for action , italian foreign minister franco frattini explained in an interview that italy will present a package of compromise proposals to foreign ministers from the 25 present and future members of the eu at a meeting in naples at the end of november .
frattini told la repubblica newspaper that the italians were adamant that they would not push for an agreement on the constitution at any price and frattini said that negotiations might drag on into next year .
" we do n't want a result at any price and we are n't prepared to make concessions of all sorts just to reach a deal , " frattini said .
" our aim is not to engage in excessive mediation but to defend and , if possible , improve the constitution process .
we know the exact positions of every country .
we now have to reach an agreement on these remaining issues . "
ireland could inherit a crisis italy ’ s rotating eu presidency expires at the end of the year and many hope that the constitution will be ratified by the time the seat is handed to ireland .
but in a situation where nothing is black and white , the problems surrounding the constitution may pass on to dublin rather than being resolved in advance .
" we have to discuss things and decide in december , " frattini said .
" after that there will be two possible scenarios for the irish presidency which starts in january .
either there will be a political agreement on our proposals or ireland will have the time to work out the details and complete the drafting of the texts . "
such a choice of words disguises the fact it may not be as simple as all that .
the irish may well inherit a crisis if certain countries veto the agreement the italians prepare .
spain and future member poland are particularly annoyed at the way the constitution limits their weight in eu decision-making .
one of the six biggest eu members by demographic count , poland was allocated 27 votes in the eu 's decision-making council of ministers under the nice treaty , just two less than germany despite having half its population .
spain and poland fear power of major players poland and spain , which were awarded the same number of votes , have balked at a proposal in the draft constitution under which decisions would pass if they had the support of more than half the member-states representing three-fifths of the eu population .
warsaw , madrid and other critics argue this would concentrate power in the hands of bigger member-states - britain , france , germany and italy - who all back the draft text .
a number of small countries are also upset that while the constitution stipulates each of the 25 eu states will be represented by a commissioner , only 15 of them will have voting powers .
the italians are prepared for opposition to the proposals and have discussed an opt-out clause which would enable any country that does n't ratify the constitution to stay outside it but still have the possibility of automatically coming back in after it changes its mind , frattini explained . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de little to show after eu summit eu heads of state have little to show after a two-day summit meeting in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.10.2003 israeli foreign minister visits germany , defends security fence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom places a stone on a grave in berlin 's jewish quarter .
a day after the un passed a resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a security fence , israel 's foreign minister made his first visit to germany and defended his country 's right to security . israeli foreign minister silvan shalom began a three-day visit to germany wednesday with the official purpose of drawing attention to and condemning the rise of anti-semitism in europe and around the world .
but as israeli government officials vowed to press-on with efforts to build a controversial security fence in palestinian territory despite a day-old un resolution - sponsored by the european union - calling on israel to cease and desist , rising tensions in the middle east overshadowed shalom 's visit . speaking during a visit to a former concentration camp north of berlin , the israeli foreign minister defended his government 's hardened stance , stating that , " it is our right to defend our land and our citizens , a right no one can take away from us . " making the rounds in berlin the foreign minister began his visit to germany 's capitol on wednesday by meeting with german chancellor gerhard schröder - details of their conversation were not released to the press .
he then travelled to a former concentration camp in sachsenhausen , just north of berlin . laying flowers on the grounds where thousands of jews were killed by the nazis , shalom used the opportunity to warn about the growing threat of anti-semitism in europe and the arab world .
" today , less than 60 years after the holocaust , we are witnesses to a re-sprouting of anti-semitism in europe .
this sprays its poison not just against its traditional goal , jews , but the new anti-semitism is also directed against israel , " he told the crowd . attacks against jews have been on the rise in germany .
last month , police uncovered a plot by several far-right groups to bomb a jewish sight in munich . later wednesday night , shalom met with the german foreign minister joschka fischer , but the two discussed more than the problems of anti-semitism and touched on the mounting crisis in the middle east .
they discussed the eu 's role in dealing with iran , and germany 's role as intermediary in an upcoming hostage exchange between israel and hezbollah militants . the future of middle east peace hangs in the balance and all must work towards that goal .
a spokesman for fischer reiterated the german position : " the implementation of the ' road map ' is without an alternative . " defiant israel builds fence , despite un demands shalom arrived in germany a day after the un general assembly passed a tough new resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a controversial security fence , which is located within palestinian territory . the resolution was sponsored by the european union , and all 15 members , including germany , voted to support it in the general assembly .
the vote passed with 144 in favor and 4 against , including the united states and israel .
-lrb- twelve countries abstained . -rrb- the eu agreed to sponsor the resolution after an earlier version proposed by arab governments was toned down .
the compromise text calls on israel to " stop and reverse the construction of the wall in the occupied palestinian territory , " which it says is " in contradiction to relevant provisions of international law . "
the arab government 's resolution proposed turning the matter over to the international court of justice to issue an advisory opinion , which the eu member states objected to . despite the un 's censure , israeli officials , the foreign minister included , say their government wo n't reverse course .
shalom made this position known during his visit to berlin , and back home , israel 's deputy prime minister , ehud olmert , stated the same thing more explicitly .
" the fence will continue being built and we will go on taking care of the security of israel 's citizens , " olmert told israel radio . how can israel continue to go against the will of the majority of the international community , including the will of the eu ?
" israel can and will ignore the latest un resolution for one simple reason : israel can be sure of the usa 's support , " avi primor , the former israeli ambassador to germany told deutsche welle .
he added that , as the situation worsens , in his opinion the majority of the israelis are also against the security fence . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 22.10.2003 selling ads to keep germany 's high schools afloat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ad agencies want to tap into childrens ' growing buying power beset by budget problems , a high school in frankfurt has begun renting out ad space in order to buy basic items .
some teachers , and state school authorities are n't too happy about the decision . when simple things like buying a tv and video player were n't financially feasible anymore , manfred timpe turned to the advertising world to bail him out .
the principal of frankfurt 's small falkschule recently began renting out ad space for € 90 -lrb- $ 105 -rrb- a month to mobile phone and comic book companies , giving them access to his lucrative student body .
teachers and the state school authorities swiftly criticized timpe 's move , but loopholes in the state law have so far kept him in the clear . " we asked ourselves if this was possible .
is it correct from an educational point of view , " said timpe , who estimated his annual budget at only € 13,000 , in a deutsche welle interview .
the money has to be stetched to cover everything from chalk to new computers .
" considering the increasing shortage of money available to schools , it 's a welcome help . " commercial advertising in schools has long been part of daily life in american high schools , where posters advertising candy and chips cover hallways , and school cafeterias sign lucrative contracts with fast-food chains .
german schools have been slower to follow . three states ban advertising outright , but amid steadily shrinking school budgets most allow their schools to rent out ad space as long as it helps them to buy needed materials . " there has been advertising in schools for 10 or 20 years without anybody realizing it , " said tino leutner , head of the ad firm school , which does a brisk business in school advertising .
" so it 's already quite common place … what we need now are clearer guidelines for school legislation . " lucrative market of 13 million with an estimated market of 13 million schoolchildren , it 's no wonder firms like school want existing legislation to be loosened .
recent studies have shown that the buying power of german kids continues to rise .
most teens receive an average monthly allowance of € 80 and spend liberally on clothes and mobile phones , according to a recent study by publishers axel springer and bauer verlag . that 's exactly why teenagers should n't receive more encouragement at school , say some . " there 's enough advertising already , " says susanne levin , a teacher at the falkschule .
" wherever they go , children are encouraged to spend money on things they do n't need , and it does n't need to happen at school too . " state school authorities agree . " fortunately , schools are still a place that can offer an escape from reality , at least in some areas , " said hans-rolf eifer , from the hesse school authority .
" schools can make students aware of negative developments , which i think should n't be taking place everywhere in the first place .

the company , which until last year was close to collapse under the weight of heavy debts , said it made 133.9bn won -lrb- $ 113m ; £ 68m -rrb- in the three months to september .
the previous year , the same period had produced a 616.8bn won loss .
hynix said that chip prices rising at last had turned its performance around , with the back-to-school shopping spree in the us in particular producing an rise in sales of 27 % over the previous year , and 20 % on the three months to june .
and it predicted the end-of-year holiday boom would see things get even better .
the company also said its debts had narrowed slightly to 5.35 trillion won from 5.45 trillion won three months earlier .
the debts are the reason the firm is now 70 % owned by its creditors .
the south korean banks to which it owed tens of trillions of won arranged a debt-for-equity bailout in december 2002 , following the collapse of a planned takeover by larger us rival micron .
despite the turnaround , there may still be trouble in store for hynix .
earlier this year , both the us and the european union decided to apply extra tariffs on the company , accusing the south korean government of unfairly subsidising the firm 's business .

" china is certainly in our top three or four trade partners now , " national australia bank currency strategist greg mckenna told bbc world business report .
the switch in attention came as the dollar 's slide against asian currencies - principally the yen and the chinese yuan - was temporarily arrested , after a key asian leaders ' meeting failed to comment on the foreign exchange markets .
in recent weeks asia has figured large in the currency markets , amid loud us complaints that china is keeping its currency far too weak and japanese worries that the yen is rising too fast for its exporters to cope with .
the new surge has taken the aussie dollar past 70 us cents before slipping back to just below that line , its highest level since late 1997 .
australia 's currency climbed 25 % through 2003 to date , as the economy has remained strong despite a punishing drought , the sars virus and the effects of the war in iraq .
hopes high prices for commodities - australia has a strong position in minerals in particular - have helped prop up the country 's currency .
the key driver , though , was the belief that the arrival of chinese president hu jintao in sydney on wednesday heralded an imminent trade deal .
china is now australia 's third biggest partner after the us and japan , with trade almost tripling to a $ 21bn -lrb- $ 14.7bn ; £ 8.8bn -rrb- since 1996 .
the government in canberra has made no secret that it wants a bilateral deal with china , particularly in the wake of the collapse of world trade organisation talks in september .
this week has seen such deals dominate the apec -lrb- asia pacific economic co-operation -rrb- summit , with japan and south korea agreeing to negotiate over such a pact , and the us beginning talks with thailand .
a schedule for the china-australia talks may be announced on friday , the trade ministry said .
in the meantime , the strength of the aussie dollar is keeping inflation low , with prices rising just 0.6 % in the third quarter of 2003 .
but that might not stop the reserve bank from boosting interest rates , already well above european and us levels at 4.75 % , in the face of a stubbornly persistent housing boom .

despite earlier fears many of the venues would not be ready in time , the ioc says it is now happy with progress .
however it is warning there is not a minute to lose .
over the next three days the ioc delegation will hold a series of meetings with the athens organising committee , as well as senior members of the greek government .
they will also tour the main sports venues , a third of which have now been completed .
volunteer boost although the ioc is being more upbeat about the prospect of most things being ready in time , there are still areas of concern .
in particular , there are fears about two important public transport projects which have fallen way behind schedule .
one is for a new railway line linking the international airport with the main olympic stadium and city centre .
there are also worries about whether the spectacular roof for the main stadium will be completed soon enough .
the ioc clearly intends to maintain pressure on the greek authorities to ensure no more time is wasted .
on a more positive note , a spokesman highlighted the huge number of people who have offered to be volunteers at the games .

states members voted by 40 votes to seven to support free school milk for another two years .
the move came despite arguments from the finance committee and others that it was not the best use of states funds .
andrew le gallais , chairman of the jersey milk marketing board , said the industry was keen to move on and forge a better relationship with the government .
earlier , members of the royal jersey agricultural & horticultural society voted against importing bull semen from outside the island .
this has been banned for 240 years , but there are concerns the quality of the island herd is suffering because it is getting smaller .
the society 's council is meeting on wednesday to consider the implications of the result .

home office figures released this week show an 11 % increase in burglary and 20 % in robbery in lincolnshire over the past financial year .
crime detection rates were down by 12 % in the county for the same period .
but lincolnshire 's assistant chief constable , peter davies , says the statistics can not be compared fairly with previous figures because of new rules on recording crime .
urban crime he says figures complied by his force indicate that overall crime is down by 5 % , house burglaries are down by 19 % and vehicle crime has dropped by 15 % in the first six months of this year .
" the streets of lincolnshire have not become more dangerous place over the past year , " he said .
there are forces in the general picture who are struggling with some issues hazel blears police minister a total of 32 of the 43 forces in england and wales achieved a lower detection rate in 2002-2003 than in the previous financial year , according to the home office statistics .
in derbyshire , burglary and car crime also increased , according to the figures .
house break-ins rose by 27 % and vehicle break-ins were also up .
derbyshire police say they have taken steps to improve the situation since the figures were calculated .
police minister hazel blears said the home office 's police standards unit -lrb- psu -rrb- is already working closely with six forces - avon and somerset , cambridgeshire , cleveland , west yorkshire , nottinghamshire and greater manchester - and was about to start work with humberside .
" clearly , there are forces in the general picture who are struggling with some issues , " she said .
she said a lack of resources meant the psu was more likely to do intensive work with urban police forces at the expense of rural ones .

we asked for volunteers to ditch their cars and use the scottish executive 's " choose another way " website to plan an alternative way of getting to and from work for a week .
by susan fraser i am a software developer with a financial services company in the west end of edinburgh work and live in the west end of glasgow .
i 've been commuting by car for the last three years and before that i took the train .
luckily , my office works on flexi-time so i can start any time before 1000 which means i usually travel outside the rush-hour .
by car , the trip takes about an hour each way and costs about £ 7 in petrol .
this week , i 'm going back to the train to test the " flagship " commuter service between the two cities .
i 'm turning back the clock - but what will i find ?
day one day two day three day four day five verdict day one to prepare for the week , i looked up the traveline website to check out my options .
once i managed to get the website to recognise details of where i live and when i want to travel , i see a list of five trains i could take to work .
there is a train to edinburgh every 15 minutes during the day and half hourly during the evening .
there is no information on fares .
0700 my alarm goes off an hour earlier than usual 0810 leave home and head for the underground a few minutes walk away -lrb- on a normal day i throw everything in the back of the car and leave at about 0845 -rrb- .
i get a multi-journey ticket for £ 7.50 for 10 journeys .
only a short wait until the tube arrives .
i have to stand , but apart from a bit of jostling from other passengers it 's fine 0825 at queen street railway station .
ask about cheapest way to travel to edinburgh for a week and am quoted £ 57 for a weekly season ticket but that a photograph is needed .
not knowing this , i have no photo and no time to go to the booth and get one .
day return costs £ 14.40 .
i ask about multi-journey tickets but am told they wo n't do , they are £ 70 for 10 journeys and i am sold a day return .
it is only later that i do the arithmetic for myself and work out that the multi-journey ticket would have been cheaper after all .
0835 missed the 0830 train while in the ticket office .
a tannoy announcement says something about my train , i think , but i ca n't make out what is said because of the noise in the station 0850 the 0845 train platform is announced and the train leaves a few minutes late .
i have a comfortable double seat to myself .
i am trying to sleep but an alarm goes off somewhere and rings for the next 20 minutes .
once it goes off , the guard comes round to check my ticket so my chance for a decent nap is gone .
arrive on time at haymarket the tannoy at queen street was impossible to make out 0935 having gone through another ticket check and after a brief walk , i arrive at work half an hour later than if i had driven 1850 leave work and head for haymarket .
i know that although the trains are now half hourly , one is due at 1904 1904 train arrives dead on time and although it is quite busy , i get a seat and settle down .
however , this carriage has a crying baby , a man with a very loud personal stereo and someone making noisy business phone calls .
i move to the other carriage and sleep for the rest of the trip 2000 arrive in a very wet glasgow .
head to underground station where even at this time of night the platform is crowded and there is a long wait for the train .
when it does arrive , there is a bit of jostling but everyone gets a seat .
the man sitting opposite me is behaving very oddly and staring at other people on the train .
when it reaches my stop i hurry home quickly 2025 home at last , damp and tired .
today 's travelling has taken more than an hour longer and cost more than £ 9 more than my usual monday .
day two i need to leave work early today so i am heading off a bit earlier , at 0745 .
however , when i get to the underground , it tells me that the outer circle -lrb- the one going to the city centre -rrb- is currently off .
head out to the nearest bus stop but the information there has no details of buses going down great western road that go near queen street station .
start walking towards the city centre and hail a taxi that stops to tell me he ca n't turn on the busy street - and drives away .
i do n't see another free taxi all the way to the station bad news greeted me at the underground 0845 reach the station on foot and buy a day ticket and despite being caught in the broken doors of the ticket office , i catch the 0845 train .
same as yesterday though , the train is delayed only by about 10 minutes .
there are plenty seats .
buy a cup of tea from the trolley and am astonished that a small plastic cup and a tea bag cost £ 1.45 0950 finally reach work after travelling for nearly two hours 1635 leave work in a rush and head to station .
get through the ticket check and onto platform just in time to catch the 1649 train .
it only has four carriages which do n't seem much for rush-hour and as expected the train is crowded .
i 'd been looking forward to a nap but as it turns out i have to stand for most of the journey as does an elderly couple .
no-one , even those in the priority seats , offers to give up their place for them .
standing space is also limited , especially as there is a man with a small baby in a pram who has nowhere else to go but stand at the doors 1800 home again .
it 's been a long day .
i 've spent nearly three-and-a-half hours travelling , one-and-a-half more than usual and i 've lost more than an hour of flexi-time at work .
day three 0800 i leave the house and miraculously arrive at the underground station just as a train is pulling in .
arrive at queen street just in time to run and catch the 0815 train .
i manage to get one of the last seats -lrb- not everyone is so lucky -rrb- and pay for my ticket en route .
by the time we reach haymarket the train is overcrowded again but it is on time 0915 i arrive at work .
this journey has actually taken about the same time as it would have done by car at this time of day the train toilet was n't a pleasant place 1850 having worked late to catch up my flexi-time that i lost yesterday , i head off to haymarket station .
as i 'm a little early i have time to notice the nice new coffee shop and some of the environmental improvements made to the station since i last used it regularly .
it 's still pretty cold and dirty but better than it was 1904 train arrives on time and is busy but not too crowded .
i am sitting next to the toilets so decide to have a look .
they are dirty and smell terrible .
the hand dryer is broken and there is no water in the sink anyway .
only for use in an emergency i think .
the three men at the next table are working their way swiftly through a carry-out of beer and getting louder as the trip goes by .
arrive in glasgow on time 2000 i decide that because i 'm in town , i 'll walk to see a friend who lives nearby and tell them about my experiences on public transport .
day four perhaps encouraged by yesterday 's successes , i try setting out half an hour later at 0830 .
however , when i get to the underground station , the platform is crowded and an announcement is made that a train is out of action so there are delays .
0840 when the next train finally arrives it is so crowded that not even the most desperate travellers can squeeze on .
i manage to find a sliver of space by the doors of the next train .
as i duck my head to let the doors close , i see other people still on the platform who have been there even longer than me the tube was crammed , but i managed to squeeze in 0901 reach queen street just in time to see the 0900 train leave without me .
however , the wait for the next train lets me buy my ticket , which is only £ 7.90 because i am now late enough to get a cheap day return -lrb- although i have to return before 1630 or after 1830 -rrb- if i do n't want an extra charge .
it also gives me a chance to try out one of the many shops and snack bars .
my toasted sandwich and earl grey tea are served up swiftly although i get very little change from £ 5 0915 the train is quiet .
i enjoy my hot breakfast and have a nap until we get to haymarket 1015 arrive at work a quarter of an hour after the flexi-time deadline and have to explain to my boss about crowded underground trains 1850 with my cheap day return the first train i catch home is the 1904 .
i arrive at the station on time but the train is delayed , in the event by less than 10 minutes but as it is the first off-peak train of the evening , it is crowded .
the problem is made worse by people taking up seats with their jackets and bags and deliberately sitting in the aisle seats to deter anyone from sitting beside them .
despite this i manage to get a seat and pass the trip chatting to the person sitting next to me .
train arrives in glasgow and i head for the underground 2030 home after another long day day five as i have a work night out tonight , i have an extra big bag with my change of clothes .
it also means i want to get in early today .
0740 the earlier time means the underground is quiet but it does take a while to arrive .
i still get to queen street at just on 0800 .
try to run to catch the train but it is 0801 and it has already gone from the information screens .
it is only when i see the train leaving a couple of minutes later that i realise i could have caught it if the platform information had still been up .
however , to pass the time i buy a bacon roll and a tea .
i use a different food stall this time and am only charged £ 3 0815 after a wait on the platform , with no seats available making eating breakfast rather difficult , the train turns up on time .
plenty seats and the trip is quite pleasant 0915 arrive at work .
i have still taken more than an hour-and-a-half to arrive against less than an hour in the car on a normal friday going home after work i get a lift with a friend and get ready to go out at his house .
he kindly gives me a lift to the restaurant as well .
after a good night out i have to leave the pub early to make sure i get the last train home at 2334 .
it 's a 20-minute walk to the station and not being familiar with this bit of town i have no idea what buses there might be at this time of night .
it 's imperative that i catch this train or i will be stuck in edinburgh .
i 'm lucky enough to hail a taxi to the station - £ 3.50 .
now i 'm early and i have a 15-minute wait on the platform .
sometimes there was standing room only on the train at this time of night it 's getting pretty cold but the coffee shop and waiting room are closed .
the only indoor waiting area is a passageway leading to the toilets .
however , there is no seating and the smell of stale urine in there is so strong that i choose to stand in the cold instead .
train arrives on time and is busy .
the carriage is noisy with drunken people starting singalongs and continuing to drink on the train .
the train visits every station on the way home and arrives in glasgow at 0040 , more than 10 minutes later than advertised .
i checked the traveline website the night before and it suggested that i should now walk to renfrew street and catch a bus to the west end .
however , with the train arriving late i wo n't catch the last bus .
also , it is very late at night and i am on my own .
i join the taxi queue at queen street and after a 15-minute wait and a £ 4 taxi ride , i get home a little after 0100 .
it has taken nearly two hours to get home , when the car would have taken less than an hour at this time .
verdict " choose another way " is about asking yourself if the car is the best way for you to make every journey .
it 's about taking a moment to think before you get behind the wheel and to activate a rational decision-making process about your travel .
there are three reasons why i wo n't be abandoning my car just yet .
cost car : £ 7.50x5 = £ 37.50 train : full day rate £ 14.40x4 = £ 57.60 train : cheap day rate £ 7.90x1 = £ 7.90 tube : 10 journey pass £ 7.50x1 = £ 7.50 total = £ 73 i did some figures and even if all the costs of the car , insurance , maintenance , depreciation etc are included and i took an annual season ticket , it still works out cheaper across the year to drive .
the pricing structure means that depending on season tickets , timings , and multi journeys there are six different rates i could be paying and it is up to the customer to do the calculations to assess which is best .
the best deal for you could vary from week to week depending on if you had holidays , late starts , or got a lift one day .
the second reason is time .
in my normal week i spent 10-12 hours commuting in the car depending on road works , accidents and time of day .
however , even on a bad week i would not spend the 15 hours which i have this week .
there was only one day where i had no delays and even that was still longer than my usual schedule .
train ' not restful ' experience finally , despite everything that the choose another way website claims , travelling by train is not a restful and pleasant experience .
in my car i always get a warm comfy seat , i get my choice of cd , radio or silence and i have room for luggage .
on the train , i was often standing , or crammed into close packed seats .
i had cold waits in the stations and was subjected to the anti-social behaviour of some other travellers .
the advertised food services were overpriced , the trains and toilets were dirty and smelly .
none of this encourages me to want to use the train as my preferred method of travel .
i do n't think lots of single people in cars are a good thing and i was prepared to make a level of sacrifice to do the right thing and use public transport .
i also recognise that there have been improvements since i last travelled on the train and for an occasional trip the train is certainly a viable option .
but for everyday commuting it will take very significant improvements , especially in the cost of travelling , before i will be swapping to public transport .
i have taken a week to think about my rational decision and i am afraid i will be staying with my car .

my toasted sandwich and earl grey tea are served up swiftly although i get very little change from £ 5 0915 the train is quiet .
i enjoy my hot breakfast and have a nap until we get to haymarket 1015 arrive at work a quarter of an hour after the flexi-time deadline and have to explain to my boss about crowded underground trains 1850 with my cheap day return the first train i catch home is the 1904 .
i arrive at the station on time but the train is delayed , in the event by less than 10 minutes but as it is the first off-peak train of the evening , it is crowded .
the problem is made worse by people taking up seats with their jackets and bags and deliberately sitting in the aisle seats to deter anyone from sitting beside them .
despite this i manage to get a seat and pass the trip chatting to the person sitting next to me .
train arrives in glasgow and i head for the underground 2030 home after another long day day five as i have a work night out tonight , i have an extra big bag with my change of clothes .
it also means i want to get in early today .
0740 the earlier time means the underground is quiet but it does take a while to arrive .
i still get to queen street at just on 0800 .
try to run to catch the train but it is 0801 and it has already gone from the information screens .
it is only when i see the train leaving a couple of minutes later that i realise i could have caught it if the platform information had still been up .
however , to pass the time i buy a bacon roll and a tea .
i use a different food stall this time and am only charged £ 3 0815 after a wait on the platform , with no seats available making eating breakfast rather difficult , the train turns up on time .
plenty seats and the trip is quite pleasant 0915 arrive at work .
i have still taken more than an hour-and-a-half to arrive against less than an hour in the car on a normal friday going home after work i get a lift with a friend and get ready to go out at his house .
he kindly gives me a lift to the restaurant as well .
after a good night out i have to leave the pub early to make sure i get the last train home at 2334 .
it 's a 20-minute walk to the station and not being familiar with this bit of town i have no idea what buses there might be at this time of night .
it 's imperative that i catch this train or i will be stuck in edinburgh .
i 'm lucky enough to hail a taxi to the station - £ 3.50 .
now i 'm early and i have a 15-minute wait on the platform .
sometimes there was standing room only on the train at this time of night it 's getting pretty cold but the coffee shop and waiting room are closed .
the only indoor waiting area is a passageway leading to the toilets .
however , there is no seating and the smell of stale urine in there is so strong that i choose to stand in the cold instead .
train arrives on time and is busy .
the carriage is noisy with drunken people starting singalongs and continuing to drink on the train .
the train visits every station on the way home and arrives in glasgow at 0040 , more than 10 minutes later than advertised .
i checked the traveline website the night before and it suggested that i should now walk to renfrew street and catch a bus to the west end .
however , with the train arriving late i wo n't catch the last bus .
also , it is very late at night and i am on my own .
i join the taxi queue at queen street and after a 15-minute wait and a £ 4 taxi ride , i get home a little after 0100 .
it has taken nearly two hours to get home , when the car would have taken less than an hour at this time .
verdict " choose another way " is about asking yourself if the car is the best way for you to make every journey .
it 's about taking a moment to think before you get behind the wheel and to activate a rational decision-making process about your travel .
there are three reasons why i wo n't be abandoning my car just yet .
cost car : £ 7.50x5 = £ 37.50 train : full day rate £ 14.40x4 = £ 57.60 train : cheap day rate £ 7.90x1 = £ 7.90 tube : 10 journey pass £ 7.50x1 = £ 7.50 total = £ 73 i did some figures and even if all the costs of the car , insurance , maintenance , depreciation etc are included and i took an annual season ticket , it still works out cheaper across the year to drive .
the pricing structure means that depending on season tickets , timings , and multi journeys there are six different rates i could be paying and it is up to the customer to do the calculations to assess which is best .
the best deal for you could vary from week to week depending on if you had holidays , late starts , or got a lift one day .
the second reason is time .
in my normal week i spent 10-12 hours commuting in the car depending on road works , accidents and time of day .
however , even on a bad week i would not spend the 15 hours which i have this week .
there was only one day where i had no delays and even that was still longer than my usual schedule .
train ' not restful ' experience finally , despite everything that the choose another way website claims , travelling by train is not a restful and pleasant experience .
in my car i always get a warm comfy seat , i get my choice of cd , radio or silence and i have room for luggage .
on the train , i was often standing , or crammed into close packed seats .
i had cold waits in the stations and was subjected to the anti-social behaviour of some other travellers .
the advertised food services were overpriced , the trains and toilets were dirty and smelly .
none of this encourages me to want to use the train as my preferred method of travel .
i do n't think lots of single people in cars are a good thing and i was prepared to make a level of sacrifice to do the right thing and use public transport .
i also recognise that there have been improvements since i last travelled on the train and for an occasional trip the train is certainly a viable option .
but for everyday commuting it will take very significant improvements , especially in the cost of travelling , before i will be swapping to public transport .
i have taken a week to think about my rational decision and i am afraid i will be staying with my car .

however , the wait for the next train lets me buy my ticket , which is only £ 7.90 because i am now late enough to get a cheap day return -lrb- although i have to return before 1630 or after 1830 -rrb- if i do n't want an extra charge .
it also gives me a chance to try out one of the many shops and snack bars .
my toasted sandwich and earl grey tea are served up swiftly although i get very little change from £ 5 0915 the train is quiet .
i enjoy my hot breakfast and have a nap until we get to haymarket 1015 arrive at work a quarter of an hour after the flexi-time deadline and have to explain to my boss about crowded underground trains 1850 with my cheap day return the first train i catch home is the 1904 .
i arrive at the station on time but the train is delayed , in the event by less than 10 minutes but as it is the first off-peak train of the evening , it is crowded .
the problem is made worse by people taking up seats with their jackets and bags and deliberately sitting in the aisle seats to deter anyone from sitting beside them .
despite this i manage to get a seat and pass the trip chatting to the person sitting next to me .
train arrives in glasgow and i head for the underground 2030 home after another long day day five as i have a work night out tonight , i have an extra big bag with my change of clothes .
it also means i want to get in early today .
0740 the earlier time means the underground is quiet but it does take a while to arrive .
i still get to queen street at just on 0800 .
try to run to catch the train but it is 0801 and it has already gone from the information screens .
it is only when i see the train leaving a couple of minutes later that i realise i could have caught it if the platform information had still been up .
however , to pass the time i buy a bacon roll and a tea .
i use a different food stall this time and am only charged £ 3 0815 after a wait on the platform , with no seats available making eating breakfast rather difficult , the train turns up on time .
plenty seats and the trip is quite pleasant 0915 arrive at work .
i have still taken more than an hour-and-a-half to arrive against less than an hour in the car on a normal friday going home after work i get a lift with a friend and get ready to go out at his house .
he kindly gives me a lift to the restaurant as well .
after a good night out i have to leave the pub early to make sure i get the last train home at 2334 .
it 's a 20-minute walk to the station and not being familiar with this bit of town i have no idea what buses there might be at this time of night .
it 's imperative that i catch this train or i will be stuck in edinburgh .
i 'm lucky enough to hail a taxi to the station - £ 3.50 .
now i 'm early and i have a 15-minute wait on the platform .
sometimes there was standing room only on the train at this time of night it 's getting pretty cold but the coffee shop and waiting room are closed .
the only indoor waiting area is a passageway leading to the toilets .
however , there is no seating and the smell of stale urine in there is so strong that i choose to stand in the cold instead .
train arrives on time and is busy .
the carriage is noisy with drunken people starting singalongs and continuing to drink on the train .
the train visits every station on the way home and arrives in glasgow at 0040 , more than 10 minutes later than advertised .
i checked the traveline website the night before and it suggested that i should now walk to renfrew street and catch a bus to the west end .
however , with the train arriving late i wo n't catch the last bus .
also , it is very late at night and i am on my own .
i join the taxi queue at queen street and after a 15-minute wait and a £ 4 taxi ride , i get home a little after 0100 .
it has taken nearly two hours to get home , when the car would have taken less than an hour at this time .
verdict " choose another way " is about asking yourself if the car is the best way for you to make every journey .
it 's about taking a moment to think before you get behind the wheel and to activate a rational decision-making process about your travel .
there are three reasons why i wo n't be abandoning my car just yet .
cost car : £ 7.50x5 = £ 37.50 train : full day rate £ 14.40x4 = £ 57.60 train : cheap day rate £ 7.90x1 = £ 7.90 tube : 10 journey pass £ 7.50x1 = £ 7.50 total = £ 73 i did some figures and even if all the costs of the car , insurance , maintenance , depreciation etc are included and i took an annual season ticket , it still works out cheaper across the year to drive .
the pricing structure means that depending on season tickets , timings , and multi journeys there are six different rates i could be paying and it is up to the customer to do the calculations to assess which is best .
the best deal for you could vary from week to week depending on if you had holidays , late starts , or got a lift one day .
the second reason is time .
in my normal week i spent 10-12 hours commuting in the car depending on road works , accidents and time of day .
however , even on a bad week i would not spend the 15 hours which i have this week .
there was only one day where i had no delays and even that was still longer than my usual schedule .
train ' not restful ' experience finally , despite everything that the choose another way website claims , travelling by train is not a restful and pleasant experience .
in my car i always get a warm comfy seat , i get my choice of cd , radio or silence and i have room for luggage .
on the train , i was often standing , or crammed into close packed seats .
i had cold waits in the stations and was subjected to the anti-social behaviour of some other travellers .
the advertised food services were overpriced , the trains and toilets were dirty and smelly .
none of this encourages me to want to use the train as my preferred method of travel .
i do n't think lots of single people in cars are a good thing and i was prepared to make a level of sacrifice to do the right thing and use public transport .
i also recognise that there have been improvements since i last travelled on the train and for an occasional trip the train is certainly a viable option .
but for everyday commuting it will take very significant improvements , especially in the cost of travelling , before i will be swapping to public transport .
i have taken a week to think about my rational decision and i am afraid i will be staying with my car .

as i duck my head to let the doors close , i see other people still on the platform who have been there even longer than me the tube was crammed , but i managed to squeeze in 0901 reach queen street just in time to see the 0900 train leave without me .
however , the wait for the next train lets me buy my ticket , which is only £ 7.90 because i am now late enough to get a cheap day return -lrb- although i have to return before 1630 or after 1830 -rrb- if i do n't want an extra charge .
it also gives me a chance to try out one of the many shops and snack bars .
my toasted sandwich and earl grey tea are served up swiftly although i get very little change from £ 5 0915 the train is quiet .
i enjoy my hot breakfast and have a nap until we get to haymarket 1015 arrive at work a quarter of an hour after the flexi-time deadline and have to explain to my boss about crowded underground trains 1850 with my cheap day return the first train i catch home is the 1904 .
i arrive at the station on time but the train is delayed , in the event by less than 10 minutes but as it is the first off-peak train of the evening , it is crowded .
the problem is made worse by people taking up seats with their jackets and bags and deliberately sitting in the aisle seats to deter anyone from sitting beside them .
despite this i manage to get a seat and pass the trip chatting to the person sitting next to me .
train arrives in glasgow and i head for the underground 2030 home after another long day day five as i have a work night out tonight , i have an extra big bag with my change of clothes .
it also means i want to get in early today .
0740 the earlier time means the underground is quiet but it does take a while to arrive .
i still get to queen street at just on 0800 .
try to run to catch the train but it is 0801 and it has already gone from the information screens .
it is only when i see the train leaving a couple of minutes later that i realise i could have caught it if the platform information had still been up .
however , to pass the time i buy a bacon roll and a tea .
i use a different food stall this time and am only charged £ 3 0815 after a wait on the platform , with no seats available making eating breakfast rather difficult , the train turns up on time .
plenty seats and the trip is quite pleasant 0915 arrive at work .
i have still taken more than an hour-and-a-half to arrive against less than an hour in the car on a normal friday going home after work i get a lift with a friend and get ready to go out at his house .
he kindly gives me a lift to the restaurant as well .
after a good night out i have to leave the pub early to make sure i get the last train home at 2334 .
it 's a 20-minute walk to the station and not being familiar with this bit of town i have no idea what buses there might be at this time of night .
it 's imperative that i catch this train or i will be stuck in edinburgh .
i 'm lucky enough to hail a taxi to the station - £ 3.50 .
now i 'm early and i have a 15-minute wait on the platform .
sometimes there was standing room only on the train at this time of night it 's getting pretty cold but the coffee shop and waiting room are closed .
the only indoor waiting area is a passageway leading to the toilets .
however , there is no seating and the smell of stale urine in there is so strong that i choose to stand in the cold instead .
train arrives on time and is busy .
the carriage is noisy with drunken people starting singalongs and continuing to drink on the train .
the train visits every station on the way home and arrives in glasgow at 0040 , more than 10 minutes later than advertised .
i checked the traveline website the night before and it suggested that i should now walk to renfrew street and catch a bus to the west end .
however , with the train arriving late i wo n't catch the last bus .
also , it is very late at night and i am on my own .
i join the taxi queue at queen street and after a 15-minute wait and a £ 4 taxi ride , i get home a little after 0100 .
it has taken nearly two hours to get home , when the car would have taken less than an hour at this time .
verdict " choose another way " is about asking yourself if the car is the best way for you to make every journey .
it 's about taking a moment to think before you get behind the wheel and to activate a rational decision-making process about your travel .
there are three reasons why i wo n't be abandoning my car just yet .
cost car : £ 7.50x5 = £ 37.50 train : full day rate £ 14.40x4 = £ 57.60 train : cheap day rate £ 7.90x1 = £ 7.90 tube : 10 journey pass £ 7.50x1 = £ 7.50 total = £ 73 i did some figures and even if all the costs of the car , insurance , maintenance , depreciation etc are included and i took an annual season ticket , it still works out cheaper across the year to drive .
the pricing structure means that depending on season tickets , timings , and multi journeys there are six different rates i could be paying and it is up to the customer to do the calculations to assess which is best .
the best deal for you could vary from week to week depending on if you had holidays , late starts , or got a lift one day .
the second reason is time .
in my normal week i spent 10-12 hours commuting in the car depending on road works , accidents and time of day .
however , even on a bad week i would not spend the 15 hours which i have this week .
there was only one day where i had no delays and even that was still longer than my usual schedule .
train ' not restful ' experience finally , despite everything that the choose another way website claims , travelling by train is not a restful and pleasant experience .
in my car i always get a warm comfy seat , i get my choice of cd , radio or silence and i have room for luggage .
on the train , i was often standing , or crammed into close packed seats .
i had cold waits in the stations and was subjected to the anti-social behaviour of some other travellers .
the advertised food services were overpriced , the trains and toilets were dirty and smelly .
none of this encourages me to want to use the train as my preferred method of travel .
i do n't think lots of single people in cars are a good thing and i was prepared to make a level of sacrifice to do the right thing and use public transport .
i also recognise that there have been improvements since i last travelled on the train and for an occasional trip the train is certainly a viable option .
but for everyday commuting it will take very significant improvements , especially in the cost of travelling , before i will be swapping to public transport .
i have taken a week to think about my rational decision and i am afraid i will be staying with my car .

rene morel 's 3d model has a very human face virtual cyberbabes are used in advertising campaigns , hit shoot-em-up games , and the pop industry , from lara croft to virtual pop idols , t-babe and diki or dk-96 .
some of the best 3d models around are currently on show at an exhibition which has just opened in london called perfectly real : women in bits and bytes .
but they raise questions about what people might be able to do with the models if they get too realistic and we can not tell the difference anymore .
better processing power and 3d graphics programs mean creating your own , virtual human is much easier to do .
hyper real while the technology is maturing , many of the women created from the hard drives and fantasies of mostly male designers are not .
the beauty of many of the images in the exhibition is striking .
but their impossibly perfect limbs , lips and looks , are still pretty far removed from what a " real " woman looks like .
rene morel , who worked on many of the main characters in the sci-fi film final fantasy , has created an incredibly beautiful and engaging figure .
what makes her really real ?
she has a stunning , highly human-like face , but as soon as you pan down her body , it is obvious she has borrowed a few diet tips from barbie .
they are the " hyper-reality " of women who only exist in a plastic surgeon 's dream .
the exhibition 's curator , niki gomez , says this is no different to the " hyper-reality " of manufactured pop bands and airbrushed celebrities which are so far removed from normal people anyway .
for years , women learned to deal with images of the " perfect woman " , celebrities , super-skinny supermodels and slinky pop kittens .
nonetheless , four in 10 women still worry about their body shape every day and more than one in three dream of losing at least two stones , says a recent survey .
" it is interesting that women are being made more than men .
i think that is partly because it is men who are mainly making them , " she says .
imperfect present brazilian creation kaya has what the artist describes as a large mouth and teeth , far-apart eyes and thick eyebrows , deliberately designed to represent " realistic woman with slight imperfections " .
do far apart eyes and visible pores make kaya more real ?
you can even see her pores , and these touches supposedly make her more real .
her makers intend to give her a strong character and let her live online , " so people can control what she says and her movements through the web , " ms gomez explains .
she does look more " realistic " than many of the airbrushed creations which grace the pages of both men and women 's magazines every day .
but perhaps some might ask why far-apart eyes , thick eyebrows , gaping pores should be seen as " imperfections " .
" in this time of real perfection in terms of plastic surgery , when it comes to the digital , we only believe them if they are not 100 % perfect and that is where the power lies , " says ms gomez .
manipulating reality some might argue advances in software and processing power should be used render images that break a few gender stereotypes .
but maybe the bigger issue is about the potential problems of creating women so realistic complete with imperfections , that we can not tell the difference anymore .
webbie tookay will never miss a modelling shoot take webbie tookay , who was signed up by modelling agency elite when she was born , as an example .
" they can control her as much as they want , there are no personality clashes , she will never grow old or fat and can be in more than one place at any time , " says ms gomez .
such realistic-looking constructs could be put to use in a variety of " entertainment industries " .
the ethical implications of their use when these 3d models finally do make it off the screen and try to pass off as real could be enormous .
" that is not really at this stage a concern because they still ca n't make a virtual woman seem real in real space and time , " says ms gomez .
" if that happens , then that will be a problem .
but it still quite a way off . "

rene morel , who worked on many of the main characters in the sci-fi film final fantasy , has created an incredibly beautiful and engaging figure .
what makes her really real ?
she has a stunning , highly human-like face , but as soon as you pan down her body , it is obvious she has borrowed a few diet tips from barbie .
they are the " hyper-reality " of women who only exist in a plastic surgeon 's dream .
the exhibition 's curator , niki gomez , says this is no different to the " hyper-reality " of manufactured pop bands and airbrushed celebrities which are so far removed from normal people anyway .
for years , women learned to deal with images of the " perfect woman " , celebrities , super-skinny supermodels and slinky pop kittens .
nonetheless , four in 10 women still worry about their body shape every day and more than one in three dream of losing at least two stones , says a recent survey .

do far apart eyes and visible pores make kaya more real ?
you can even see her pores , and these touches supposedly make her more real .
her makers intend to give her a strong character and let her live online , " so people can control what she says and her movements through the web , " ms gomez explains .
she does look more " realistic " than many of the airbrushed creations which grace the pages of both men and women 's magazines every day .
but perhaps some might ask why far-apart eyes , thick eyebrows , gaping pores should be seen as " imperfections " .
" in this time of real perfection in terms of plastic surgery , when it comes to the digital , we only believe them if they are not 100 % perfect and that is where the power lies , " says ms gomez .
manipulating reality some might argue advances in software and processing power should be used render images that break a few gender stereotypes .
but maybe the bigger issue is about the potential problems of creating women so realistic complete with imperfections , that we can not tell the difference anymore .

" they can control her as much as they want , there are no personality clashes , she will never grow old or fat and can be in more than one place at any time , " says ms gomez .
such realistic-looking constructs could be put to use in a variety of " entertainment industries " .
the ethical implications of their use when these 3d models finally do make it off the screen and try to pass off as real could be enormous .
" that is not really at this stage a concern because they still ca n't make a virtual woman seem real in real space and time , " says ms gomez .
" if that happens , then that will be a problem .
but it still quite a way off . "

he was speaking as talks were set to resume on wednesday in an effort to rescue a potential deal to restore devolution in the province .
on tuesday , ulster unionists rejected the ira 's latest act of decommissioning as not being transparent enough .
arms chief general john de chastelain 's report confirmed the quantity of weapons put beyond use by the ira was " considerably larger " than that which had been previously decommissioned by the republican movement .
speaking in the irish parliament on wednesday , mr ahern said he was " deeply disappointed that our efforts failed " .
however , while he was very frustrated , he said it was " a new day and we have to get on with it " .
mr ahern told the dail that downing street was aware that on tuesday morning he was reluctant to travel to hillsborough because of concerns about the decommissioning element .
he said he had been trying to get in contact with general de chastelain since 1830 bst on monday , but was unable to do so until he met him on tuesday at hillsborough .
mr trimble denied pro-good friday agreement unionism was in disarray , and outlined what was needed to create resolution .

" recovery would be very simple - let the prime minister put the information he has in the public domain .
" let the republicans remove from de chastelain the limitations that have prevented him from giving a full report - let him do so . "
prime minister tony blair said on tuesday night that assembly elections would go ahead as planned on 26 november .
mr blair said he was disappointed at what had happened but was hopeful that the issue could be resolved .
" i believe that if people knew the information that we have been told , yes they would be satisfied , " he said .
" but it is also the case that the commission enters into certain agreements with the bodies that do the decommissioning .
watch key statements " one part of that agreement , as they are entitled to do under the legislation , was a confidentiality clause on the exact specific details of what was decommissioned . "
mr blair and irish prime minister bertie ahern held talks with sinn fein president gerry adams at hillsborough later on tuesday .
speaking after the meeting , mr adams said there were profound difficulties in resolving the problems .
the sinn fein president later met mr trimble at hillsborough .
the northern ireland secretary , paul murphy , is expected to make a statement to parliament later on wednesday , officially confirming the assembly election will take place on 26 november .
the devolved administration at stormont was suspended a year ago amid allegations of ira intelligence-gathering in the stormont government .
they include automatic weapons , ammunition , explosives and explosive material general john de chastelain in a second statement on tuesday , the ira leadership confirmed that more weapons had been decommissioned .
in some of the strongest words the sinn fein president gerry adams has used in support of the peace process , he said sinn fein was " opposed to the use or threat of force for any political purpose " .
mr adams said : " sinn fein wants to see the guns taken out of irish society . "
the announcement of an election date came after weeks of top-level negotiations between sinn fein and the ulster unionists , as well as the british and irish governments .
sinn fein 's mitchel mclaughlin said on wednesday that the situation could still be salvaged if mr blair made a statement saying that the ira was in full compliance with the decommissioning scheme .
sdlp leader mark durkan said public confidence would not be affected by the ira waiving confidentiality over disarmament .
" the rights of the public have been waived at different times and the rights of other parties , particularly pro-agreement parties , have been waived by those involved in all this choreography , " he said .
democratic unionist leader ian paisley said the political process had descended into a farce .
" once again , events have been over-hyped and are entirely devoid of substance .
yet again the decommissioning stunt has been shown to be nothing more than a hollow sham , " he said .

these figures show that while that may be true for more expensive properties , most houses continue to grow steadily in value .
confidence strong a survey this month by the royal institution of chartered surveyors -lrb- rics -rrb- found more buyers had entered the housing market .
the group said 49 % more surveyors in england and wales reported seeing a rise in the number of people looking to buy a property during the three months to the end of september , up from 16 % in august and 11 % in july .
some 20 % more surveyors reported seeing price rises than those who saw price falls .
overall , confidence remains strong , with 46 % more surveyors expecting property prices to rise during the next three months than those who think they will fall .
the rics survey reflects confidence in the property market rather than what is actually happening to house prices .
therefore , it is usually the first to show any signs of change in the market .

a billion-dollar lawsuit against the firm was brought by the lawyers for 30,000 ecuadoreans , who say a texaco subsidiary - which later merged with chevron - poured contaminated waste water into open pits .
the plaintiffs say the company 's activities have destroyed large areas of rainforest and also led to an increased risk of cancer among the local population .
chevrontexaco denies the accusations , and its lawyers say the company had cleaned up the area after drilling the oil .
the trial began after almost a decade of legal battles in the united states ended with a us appeals court ruling that the dispute should be heard in ecuador .
environmentalists hopes the case will set a precedent forcing companies operating in the developing world to comply with the same anti-pollution standards as in the industrialised nations .
' irreparable damage ' ecuadorian indian groups say texaco - which merged with chevron in 2001 - dumped more than 18 billion of gallons of toxic materials into unlined pits and amazon rivers from 1972 to 1992 .
protesters say the company has destroyed their livelihood as a result , they say , crops were damaged , farm animals killed and cancer has increased among the local population .
as the trial opened , hundreds of indians in body paint and feathers marched outside the courthouse in lago agrio , about 180 kilometres -lrb- 110 miles -rrb- northeast from the capital , quito .
" it is irreparable damage , " jose aguilar , a local settler , was quoted as saying by the associated press news agency .
" everything has been damaged .
people have died .
everything has been lost , " mr aguilar added .
company 's defence the company has said that after leaving the country it spent $ 40m in a clean-up project that was inspected and approved by the ecuadorean government .
the company also has been arguing that environmental damage was minimal and that oil production water had been treated before being released into the environment .
but on tuesday , judge alberto guerra rejected an opening challenge to the court 's authority by the oil company 's lawyers , who argued that the judge did not have the authority to bring chevrontexaco trial for alleged damage caused by texaco .
legal experts say that with appeals and challenges on procedural matters , the case could drag on for months .

four out of the nine members of the central bank 's monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- wanted to raise interest rates this month by a quarter of a percentage point from their 48-year low of 3.5 % .
the newly published minutes of the meeting on 9 october revealed that deputy governor andrew large , executive director paul tucker and external mpc members kate barker and stephen nickell , all voted in favour of raising rates to ensure inflation remained on track to hit its 2.5 % target .
this certainly puts the cat among the pigeons peter dixon , commerzbank they were worried that the recent record rise in consumer debt could risk a sudden crash in consumer spending .
but other mpc members argued that " a premature rise in the rate might choke off the improvement in business conditions " , the minutes said .
since the new governor of the bank of england , mervyn king , has also expressed concern about the unsustainable consumer boom in a recent speech , many analysts are now convinced that the bank 's mpc has the votes for an interest rate rise before christmas .
financial futures markets have already priced in a quarter-point rise by january and an increase in interest rates by one percentage point within a year .
hike ' by new year ' the mpc minutes also expressed particular worry about the strength of the housing market .
will rates have to rise ?
bank of england 's options " the committee agreed that house prices , housing market activity and mortgage borrowing all suggested that consumption growth would not moderate as quickly as previously expected , " they said .
the voting figures took many observers by surprise , with most expecting a seven-two vote in favour of keeping rates on hold , after the bank had voted nine-zero in september for a rate freeze .
" this certainly puts the cat among the pigeons .
we 've had five-four votes in the past that have been followed by a ' no change ' in rates the next month so this does not necessarily point to a rise in november but it certainly raises the possibility , " said peter dixon of commerzbank .
later this week crucial figures will be released showing the rate of growth of the uk economy in the july-september quarter .
the government statistics office has meanwhile released major revisions to its uk growth figures for the last quarter , prompting some mpc members to wait for the bank 's own analysis of economic conditions which is released in mid-november before making a decision .
new target recent figures have shown that since july , the month when interest rates were cut to 3.50 % , uk consumers racked up the biggest increase in total borrowing on record , according to bank of england figures .
high street sales have also risen , causing concern that inflation could climb even further above government targets .
new retail sales figures will also be released later this week .
the bank of england will be told later in the year by the chancellor that it must adopt a new inflation target and a new measure of inflation .
some observers believe it may want to take action before the new framework , with its accompanying uncertainty , is put into place .

four out of the nine members of the central bank 's monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- wanted to raise interest rates this month by a quarter of a percentage point from their 48-year low of 3.5 % .
the newly published minutes of the meeting on 9 october revealed that deputy governor andrew large , executive director paul tucker and external mpc members kate barker and stephen nickell , all voted in favour of raising rates to ensure inflation remained on track to hit its 2.5 % target .
this certainly puts the cat among the pigeons peter dixon , commerzbank they were worried that the recent record rise in consumer debt could risk a sudden crash in consumer spending .
but other mpc members argued that " a premature rise in the rate might choke off the improvement in business conditions " , the minutes said .

the voting figures took many observers by surprise , with most expecting a seven-two vote in favour of keeping rates on hold , after the bank had voted nine-zero in september for a rate freeze .
" this certainly puts the cat among the pigeons .
we 've had five-four votes in the past that have been followed by a ' no change ' in rates the next month so this does not necessarily point to a rise in november but it certainly raises the possibility , " said peter dixon of commerzbank .
later this week crucial figures will be released showing the rate of growth of the uk economy in the july-september quarter .
the government statistics office has meanwhile released major revisions to its uk growth figures for the last quarter , prompting some mpc members to wait for the bank 's own analysis of economic conditions which is released in mid-november before making a decision .

the force , which is expected to defend its record on fighting racism after tuesday 's programme , confirmed the second suspension on wednesday .
it means eight officers have been suspended so far .
the others are five from greater manchester , and one from cheshire constabulary .
the programme , the secret policeman , was broadcast on tuesday night .
scenes included an asian recruit from the north wales force being treated with hostility by some of his fellow trainees .
one of the north wales officers named in the programme is pc rob pulling , who is seen dressing in an improvised ku klux klan hood .
he works in the force 's central division , which covers towns like rhyl , colwyn bay and llandudno .
pc pulling was suspended pending an investigation by north wales police before the programme was broadcast .
during the screening , when asked by undercover reporter mark daly if he was capable of killing an asian man , pc pulling replied : " i 've got it in me ... it 's a hatred thing . "
rob pulling has been suspended from north wales police pc pulling and others are heard criticising the only asian recruit in the intake who is also now with north wales police .
when the man is moved back in the course , some of the trainees are heard to cheer .
north wales police are expected to stress they have been working hard to tackle racism .
in a statement acting deputy chief constable , clive wolfendale , said : " if the bbc has evidence of racist behaviour by a north wales officer , we would want to act on that immediately .
" there is no place for racists here . "
in a news conference on wednesday , he is also expected to launch an attack on the methods used by the makers of the secret policeman .
mr wolfendale is angry that the force was not given a copy of the programme to view prior to its screening .
the programme used secret filming at the police training college the police federation 's north wales secretary richard eccles told radio wales on tuesday that north wales police had " no visible problem " of racism , and that measures were in place to deal with it .
but naz malik , of the all wales ethnic minority association , told bbc wales he was annoyed by the racism shown in the programme .
he said : " we know that the police in south wales and north wales have worked an awful lot and we 've worked with them for the last three years to make sure that attitudes within the police service change .
" so we find it rather disturbing and to an extent annoying as well , that something like this has been allowed to pass unnoticed so far . "
filming ' to be welcomed ' on wednesay , alison halford , a former member of the north wales police authority , and former assistant chief constable of merseyside , said the programme 's content was very worrying .
she said : " something has gone very dramatically wrong with the selection process .
" lets hope its a real horrible one-off and it does n't happen again . "
claire curtis-thomas , a member of the commons home affairs select committeee , told bbc wales she believed the secret filming tactic was justified .
she said : " sometimes covert activities of this kind is to be welcomed .
" it 's an awful reminder of how far we have to go but i think the police are genuinely trying to tackle this problem .
criminal charges " it remains a serious problem with a tiny minority of police officers , who are doing a huge disservice to the vast majority of police officers who are seeking to do their job in the best way that they can . "
in the making of the documentary , reporter mark daly posed as a probationary officer with greater manchester police to gather the footage for the programme .
he faces criminal charges over his move to infiltrate recruits at bruche national training centre in warrington , cheshire , to assess whether institutional racism still exists within police ranks .
mr daly spent five-and-a-half months with greater manchester police and could face charges of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception and damaging police property .
he is due to answer bail in november .
investigation the bbc has said any pay mr daly received has been kept in a separate bank account and was to be returned to the force at the end of the investigation .
as well as pc pulling , five greater manchester police trainee officers and one from cheshire have also suspended by their forces after being filmed making racist comments .
assistant chief constable alan green of greater manchester police said the force expected to take further action once it received extra material from the bbc .
he said : " racism has no place in greater manchester police and we are totally committed to tackling it both inside and outside the force .
" our investigation into the issues , which is being independently supervised , will be thorough . "
his counterpart in cheshire , david green , said the racist conduct shown in the programme was " abhorrent " .
