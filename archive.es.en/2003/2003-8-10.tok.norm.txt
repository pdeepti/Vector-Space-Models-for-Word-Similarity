renewed efforts to free the group are being taken by malian and german officials in the northern african country . new urgency has pushed negotiators in the race to free 14 european tourists being held by an islamic group in northern africa for more than four months . four of the hostage group , which includes germans , swiss and a dutch national , are seriously ill and need immediate medical treatment , according to reports .
the chief negotiator , a respected local tribal leader , is on his way back to a meeting with rebel salafist group for preaching and combat in northern mali this weekend and agents of germany 's federal investigation agency arrived in the malian capital of barmako . the hostages are the remnants of a group of 32 european adventure vacationers taken hostage by the islamic rebel group in southeastern algeria in late february and early march .
algeria security forces were able to free 17 tourists , including six germans , in may after attacking the group 's hideout . no hostages were killed in the attack , but a 46-year-old german woman reportedly died of heatstroke in late july . since the attack , the hostage-takers have moved the remaining hostages into northern mali and officials have been at pains to release as little news as possible about the situation . more than € 4 million for each hostage negotiations to secure their freedom have been ongoing .
german media reported that government officials received a video of the hostages taken around july 20 which show them in good condition .
earlier this month , german negotiators had several telephone conversations with the hostage-takers . since then , however , the government has entrusted the fate of the four germans to ag agaly , a respected leader in the touareg nomadic tribe who knows the terrain where the hostages are being held . " the negotiations are tough and time is pressing , " a member of the mali negotiating team told the wire service afp over the weekend . the islamic group has reportedly made new demands .

few in the reich knew what the maniacal nazi leader had in store for the planned 200 square kilometer -lrb- 49,421 acres -rrb- complex of underground tunnels . when forced laborers began work in 1943 , the war was already beginning to turn as the allies pushed the german army out of north africa and the soviet union . with bombing raids beginning in germany , hitler planned to move his headquarters east to poland . near wroclaw he began the fantastical project , at the cost of 150 million reichsmarks .

as the nazi regime began losing the war in 1943 , hitler set about building a massive , top-secret building complex in poland .
sixty years on , " project giant " is beginning to turn into a tourist attraction . it 's the kind of thing you wo n't find in most tourist guides . removed from main roads , absent of any documentation exhibit and crumbling into dust , the massive concrete complex was once adolf hitler 's most ambitious project .
few in the reich knew what the maniacal nazi leader had in store for the planned 200 square kilometer -lrb- 49,421 acres -rrb- complex of underground tunnels . when forced laborers began work in 1943 , the war was already beginning to turn as the allies pushed the german army out of north africa and the soviet union . with bombing raids beginning in germany , hitler planned to move his headquarters east to poland . near wroclaw he began the fantastical project , at the cost of 150 million reichsmarks . " the entire reich leadership was supposed to be lodged there , round 25,000 people , " said jürgen heckenthaler , a historian who studied the project .
" there are six or seven separate underground lairs . " not for the tour bus set today , those lairs are either closed up with bricks or filled with water .
some tunnels go on indefinitely , creating a haunting air about the place that has begun to attract more than 50,000 tourists a year , according to heckenthaler . but the area is probably not for the tour bus set .
adventure-seekers have to use ropes to lower themselves into some areas .
some of the tunnels are only reachable by a boat . locals have ventured into the labyrinth to search for hidden treasures .
rumors have it that the v2 rocket was built there , or that the pieces of the storied bernstein room , stolen by the nazis from st. petersburg in 1944 , were holed up in the tunnels . " complete rubbish , " said heckenthaler , dismissing the myths . crude museum , paintball wars but a lack of money and material on " project giant " has so far barred historians from building a documentation center on the property that could set the record straight .
for now , others have sought ways to make money off the piece of land . a polish pensioner has set up a crude museum on the land , with artefacts from the war - including a soviet t-34 tank .
in a few months , wannabe commandos will hold paintball wars in the crumbling nazi building . " and that , where 5,000 forced laborers died , " says heckenthaler .

as the nazi regime began losing the war in 1943 , hitler set about building a massive , top-secret building complex in poland .
sixty years on , " project giant " is beginning to turn into a tourist attraction . it 's the kind of thing you wo n't find in most tourist guides . removed from main roads , absent of any documentation exhibit and crumbling into dust , the massive concrete complex was once adolf hitler 's most ambitious project .
few in the reich knew what the maniacal nazi leader had in store for the planned 200 square kilometer -lrb- 49,421 acres -rrb- complex of underground tunnels . when forced laborers began work in 1943 , the war was already beginning to turn as the allies pushed the german army out of north africa and the soviet union . with bombing raids beginning in germany , hitler planned to move his headquarters east to poland . near wroclaw he began the fantastical project , at the cost of 150 million reichsmarks . " the entire reich leadership was supposed to be lodged there , round 25,000 people , " said jürgen heckenthaler , a historian who studied the project .
" there are six or seven separate underground lairs . " not for the tour bus set today , those lairs are either closed up with bricks or filled with water .
some tunnels go on indefinitely , creating a haunting air about the place that has begun to attract more than 50,000 tourists a year , according to heckenthaler . but the area is probably not for the tour bus set .

as the nazi regime began losing the war in 1943 , hitler set about building a massive , top-secret building complex in poland .
sixty years on , " project giant " is beginning to turn into a tourist attraction . it 's the kind of thing you wo n't find in most tourist guides . removed from main roads , absent of any documentation exhibit and crumbling into dust , the massive concrete complex was once adolf hitler 's most ambitious project .
few in the reich knew what the maniacal nazi leader had in store for the planned 200 square kilometer -lrb- 49,421 acres -rrb- complex of underground tunnels . when forced laborers began work in 1943 , the war was already beginning to turn as the allies pushed the german army out of north africa and the soviet union . with bombing raids beginning in germany , hitler planned to move his headquarters east to poland . near wroclaw he began the fantastical project , at the cost of 150 million reichsmarks . " the entire reich leadership was supposed to be lodged there , round 25,000 people , " said jürgen heckenthaler , a historian who studied the project .
" there are six or seven separate underground lairs . " not for the tour bus set today , those lairs are either closed up with bricks or filled with water .
some tunnels go on indefinitely , creating a haunting air about the place that has begun to attract more than 50,000 tourists a year , according to heckenthaler . but the area is probably not for the tour bus set .

four of the 14 remaining european tourists held by islamic rebels in northern africa are seriously ill .
renewed efforts to free the group are being taken by malian and german officials in the northern african country . new urgency has pushed negotiators in the race to free 14 european tourists being held by an islamic group in northern africa for more than four months . four of the hostage group , which includes germans , swiss and a dutch national , are seriously ill and need immediate medical treatment , according to reports .

as the nazi regime began losing the war in 1943 , hitler set about building a massive , top-secret building complex in poland .
sixty years on , " project giant " is beginning to turn into a tourist attraction . it 's the kind of thing you wo n't find in most tourist guides . removed from main roads , absent of any documentation exhibit and crumbling into dust , the massive concrete complex was once adolf hitler 's most ambitious project .
few in the reich knew what the maniacal nazi leader had in store for the planned 200 square kilometer -lrb- 49,421 acres -rrb- complex of underground tunnels . when forced laborers began work in 1943 , the war was already beginning to turn as the allies pushed the german army out of north africa and the soviet union . with bombing raids beginning in germany , hitler planned to move his headquarters east to poland . near wroclaw he began the fantastical project , at the cost of 150 million reichsmarks .

few in the reich knew what the maniacal nazi leader had in store for the planned 200 square kilometer -lrb- 49,421 acres -rrb- complex of underground tunnels . when forced laborers began work in 1943 , the war was already beginning to turn as the allies pushed the german army out of north africa and the soviet union . with bombing raids beginning in germany , hitler planned to move his headquarters east to poland . near wroclaw he began the fantastical project , at the cost of 150 million reichsmarks . " the entire reich leadership was supposed to be lodged there , round 25,000 people , " said jürgen heckenthaler , a historian who studied the project .
" there are six or seven separate underground lairs . " not for the tour bus set today , those lairs are either closed up with bricks or filled with water .
some tunnels go on indefinitely , creating a haunting air about the place that has begun to attract more than 50,000 tourists a year , according to heckenthaler . but the area is probably not for the tour bus set .
adventure-seekers have to use ropes to lower themselves into some areas .
some of the tunnels are only reachable by a boat . locals have ventured into the labyrinth to search for hidden treasures .
rumors have it that the v2 rocket was built there , or that the pieces of the storied bernstein room , stolen by the nazis from st. petersburg in 1944 , were holed up in the tunnels . " complete rubbish , " said heckenthaler , dismissing the myths . crude museum , paintball wars but a lack of money and material on " project giant " has so far barred historians from building a documentation center on the property that could set the record straight .
for now , others have sought ways to make money off the piece of land . a polish pensioner has set up a crude museum on the land , with artefacts from the war - including a soviet t-34 tank .
in a few months , wannabe commandos will hold paintball wars in the crumbling nazi building . " and that , where 5,000 forced laborers died , " says heckenthaler .

four of the 14 remaining european tourists held by islamic rebels in northern africa are seriously ill .
renewed efforts to free the group are being taken by malian and german officials in the northern african country . new urgency has pushed negotiators in the race to free 14 european tourists being held by an islamic group in northern africa for more than four months . four of the hostage group , which includes germans , swiss and a dutch national , are seriously ill and need immediate medical treatment , according to reports .
the chief negotiator , a respected local tribal leader , is on his way back to a meeting with rebel salafist group for preaching and combat in northern mali this weekend and agents of germany 's federal investigation agency arrived in the malian capital of barmako . the hostages are the remnants of a group of 32 european adventure vacationers taken hostage by the islamic rebel group in southeastern algeria in late february and early march .
algeria security forces were able to free 17 tourists , including six germans , in may after attacking the group 's hideout . no hostages were killed in the attack , but a 46-year-old german woman reportedly died of heatstroke in late july . since the attack , the hostage-takers have moved the remaining hostages into northern mali and officials have been at pains to release as little news as possible about the situation . more than € 4 million for each hostage negotiations to secure their freedom have been ongoing .
german media reported that government officials received a video of the hostages taken around july 20 which show them in good condition .
earlier this month , german negotiators had several telephone conversations with the hostage-takers . since then , however , the government has entrusted the fate of the four germans to ag agaly , a respected leader in the touareg nomadic tribe who knows the terrain where the hostages are being held . " the negotiations are tough and time is pressing , " a member of the mali negotiating team told the wire service afp over the weekend . the islamic group has reportedly made new demands .
german and swiss government officials were already frustrated after the hostage-takers asked for ransom money reported as more than 60 million euro . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

sixty years on , " project giant " is beginning to turn into a tourist attraction . it 's the kind of thing you wo n't find in most tourist guides . removed from main roads , absent of any documentation exhibit and crumbling into dust , the massive concrete complex was once adolf hitler 's most ambitious project .
few in the reich knew what the maniacal nazi leader had in store for the planned 200 square kilometer -lrb- 49,421 acres -rrb- complex of underground tunnels . when forced laborers began work in 1943 , the war was already beginning to turn as the allies pushed the german army out of north africa and the soviet union . with bombing raids beginning in germany , hitler planned to move his headquarters east to poland . near wroclaw he began the fantastical project , at the cost of 150 million reichsmarks . " the entire reich leadership was supposed to be lodged there , round 25,000 people , " said jürgen heckenthaler , a historian who studied the project .
" there are six or seven separate underground lairs . " not for the tour bus set today , those lairs are either closed up with bricks or filled with water .
some tunnels go on indefinitely , creating a haunting air about the place that has begun to attract more than 50,000 tourists a year , according to heckenthaler . but the area is probably not for the tour bus set .

most home computer users in the uk have no idea what so-called wi-fi hotspots are , a survey has found .
just under 30 % of those quizzed knew that the term refers to an area where you can connect to the internet without having to plug a cable into your computer .
the findings will prove disappointing for companies looking to tempt people to log on via wireless services in cafes , pubs and hotels .
currently there are about 1,000 public hotspots available throughout europe .
they allow people with laptops and handheld computers to surf the internet or send and receive data at broadband speeds , provided they have the right wireless equipment .
posh hot tub the polling group mori interviewed just under a thousand people for the survey on behalf of the computer seller packard bell .
to go wireless , you need the right equipment they were asked what the term wi-fi hotspot meant and were offered a list of possible answers .
the wireless technology jargon baffled most people , who instead opted for some of the more bizarre choices .
five per cent thought that it referred to a night club , while 2 % said it was something smelly that had been left in the sun for too long .
among the other explanations picked by people was a posh hot tub , a sunbed and a microwave ready meal .
and 1 % of married people though that it meant someone was having trouble with the wife .
" it is very interesting to see the number of people who have opted for the more outlandish responses , " said graham hopper , managing director of packard bell uk and eire .
" it always takes a while for new technologies to filter through to all users .
" as consumers increasingly see a network of wi-fi hotspots springing up everywhere from coffee shops and pubs to hotels and airports and it becomes more common to see people making use of wireless internet access points , the understanding will grow very rapidly . "
the finding that technical jargon confuses many will come as little surprise to some .

most home computer users in the uk have no idea what so-called wi-fi hotspots are , a survey has found .
just under 30 % of those quizzed knew that the term refers to an area where you can connect to the internet without having to plug a cable into your computer .
the findings will prove disappointing for companies looking to tempt people to log on via wireless services in cafes , pubs and hotels .

the wireless technology jargon baffled most people , who instead opted for some of the more bizarre choices .
five per cent thought that it referred to a night club , while 2 % said it was something smelly that had been left in the sun for too long .
among the other explanations picked by people was a posh hot tub , a sunbed and a microwave ready meal .
and 1 % of married people though that it meant someone was having trouble with the wife .
" it is very interesting to see the number of people who have opted for the more outlandish responses , " said graham hopper , managing director of packard bell uk and eire .
" it always takes a while for new technologies to filter through to all users .
" as consumers increasingly see a network of wi-fi hotspots springing up everywhere from coffee shops and pubs to hotels and airports and it becomes more common to see people making use of wireless internet access points , the understanding will grow very rapidly . "

talkin tarn country park , near brampton , is owned and managed by cumbria county council who say they are currently losing £ 30,000 and want to sell it off .
but people who regularly use the 185-acre park and those living nearby have been so outraged they are campaigning against the sell off .
they say the tarn was left to the people of brampton and want more than just guarantees about public access .
mike mitchelson , the leader of the carlisle city council , said it could take on the tarn if the county council would agree a nominal price for it .
the park includes the 65-acre tarn , woodland and wetland , tea room , boating facilities , education room , grazing land , campsite and a hotel .
mr mitchelson said : " the county council obviously see talkin tarn as a financial millstone so what we would like to do it take it over or discuss a nominal fee to take it over in its entirety .
" officers have had meetings and shared information and we feel that if we were allowed to take it over we could run it and develop it as a beauty spot in the north . "
