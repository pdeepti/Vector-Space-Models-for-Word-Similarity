ceredigion county council intends to move the mart from its 1.5 acre site in aberystwyth town centre so that new supermarkets can be built in its place .
but moving the council-owned mart to a new six acre site at lovesgrove two miles east of the seaside town would involve building a larger modern market costing £ 1.3m this has angered the mart 's tenant and market operator , aled ellis , who maintains that a like-for-like market would only cost about £ 200,000 .
the county council looks like it is going for a rolls royce mart when there is absolutely no need for it aled ellis , market operator ceredigion county council 's cabinet will meet with mr ellis to discuss the move on monday .
" the county council looks like it is going for a rolls royce mart when there is absolutely no need for it , " said mr ellis .
rationalised " the current site conforms to defra regulations so i do n't understand why a like-for-like site can not be built at lovesgrove . "
the mart developer is shrewsbury-based company liberty mercian .
the mart redevelopment would involve the erection of a purpose-built building , parking provision , an appropriate drainage network and a covered area for animals as well as on site grazing facilities .
" markets are being rationalised with many closing all over the country , " said company director , chris towers .
" my opinion is that you could n't build a like-for-like mart now because the nature of marts has changed due to the buying power of supermarkets . "
farmers believe it is vital that a mart should still be held in the area philip ellis , the county council 's development manager , said the site of the current mart would be developed to provide new stores for kwik save and somerfield as well as providing an extra 100 car parking spaces for the somerfield store .
the existing somerfield store in the town would be occupied by a major non-food retailer .
mr ellis agreed that a full-scale replacement of the type proposed by liberty mercian was expensive .
" the scheme has progressed to an extent that the council has to consider where to go from here , " he added .
the mart , which is held every wednesday , attracts farmers from ceredigion , powys and gwynedd with up to 3,000 ewes being brought for sale every week .
local farmer tegwyn lewis said it was important that a mart continued at aberystwyth .
" we are only just getting over foot-and-mouth so it is vital for farmers to have a mart and the county council should re-invest in a new one , " he said .
the county council 's cabinet will meet aled ellis to discuss the proposals on monday .
