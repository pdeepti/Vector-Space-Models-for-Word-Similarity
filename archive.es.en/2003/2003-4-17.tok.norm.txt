more than 10,000 police sought to maintain order , but violence – including molotav cocktail attacks – led to the arrest of at least 106 . five people were injured . but the protests failed to detract attention from the developments inside the summit , where attention focused on the eu 's imminent expansion and the difficult work of bringing iraq - which has languished under 12 years of u.n. sanctions and the crippling leadership of dictator saddam hussein - back on to the international stage . " the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .
however , many of the key leaders who attended the historical treaty signing in athens had already departed by thursday , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister jose maria aznar . in addition to the current 15 eu members and 10 accession states , all three candidate countries – turkey , romania and bulgaria – took place in the meeting along with albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro , the ukraine , russia , moldavia , switzerland , liechtenstein , norway and iceland . the declaration the following is the full-text of the eu declaration : " the european union welcomes the presence of the united nations secretary general and the opportunity to discuss with him the next steps on iraq .
" at this stage the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums .
" the people of iraq now have the chance to shape a new future for their country and to rejoin the international community .
" the international community has a major contribution to make in that process , in particular : · the u.n. must play a central role including in the process leading toward self-government for the iraqi people , enlisting its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict union building · iraq 's neighbors should support stability in iraq and the region · the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country · the eu welcomes the participation of the international financial institutions as set out in the recent statement by the g7 at the world bank meeting in washington " the eu welcomes the appointment by the u.n. secretary general of a special adviser on iraq and looks forward to a further strengthening of the u.n. 's involvement in post-conflict iraq , initially in the coordination of the humanitarian assistance .
" as part of the process of regional security and stability the eu reaffirms its commitments to bring the israeli-palestinian peace process to a successful conclusion through the implementation of the steps foreseen in the quartet 's -lsb- eu , us , un and russia -rsb- roadmap , keeping within established timelines .
" it is essential that there is an early endorsement by chairman arafat and the palestinian legislative council of a cabinet nominated by abu mazen and committed to reform . "

dw-world talks to analysts about where it 's headed next . with the german and british flags displayed neatly behind him , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday uttered the words that he hopes will heal the rift that iraq has opened within europe and across the atlantic . " no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " he said , following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , america ' strongest eu ally in the iraq war . foreign policy analysts in germany could n't agree more .
the iraq war marked the biggest step forward in a german foreign policy that has been growing out of the shadows of world war ii and the cold war . some see it as a positive part of germany 's political evolution since reunification 12 years ago .
to others , germany is treading a dangerous line by alienating the united states and putting its faith in the fledgling foreign policy of a fractious and unreliable europe . " i think this is a watershed , " said jens van scherpenberg , head of the transatlantic affairs department of the german institute for international and security affairs .
" the transatlantic alliance is not about to be what it was . " the decline of the u.s.-german relationship since just after sept .
11 , 2001 , when around 300,000 germans gathered in berlin 's tiergarten park to show their solidarity with the united states , relations between berlin and washington have taken a massive turn .
agreement with the u.s. in afghanistan turned to cautious criticism and then outright disagreement when the bush administration began agitating for a military invasion of iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer takes part in a moment of silence in front of the us embassy in berlin on thursday , september 13 , 2001 .
nationwide germans were taking part in a moment of silence at 10 a.m. in memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks in the united states . as the u.n. security council debated a u.s. and british demand to sanction military action against hussein 's regime in baghdad , germany partnered with france , russia and china to form a powerful anti-war alliance . the u.s.-british coalition eventually went to war without a u.n. resolution and american congressmen renamed their cafeteria french fries to " freedom " fries and vowed to strike back at former allies france and germany . " it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy . " what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . " dr. ingo peters , who heads the center on transatlantic foreign and security policy studies at berlin 's free university , said schröder 's team could have adopted a better tactic . " the problem is that the transatlantic relationship is n't just a bilateral relationship , it 's a multilateral relationship , " said peters .
" and so it 's not just the -lrb- german-american relationship -rrb- that has been damaged , it 's the european-american relationship as well . " the battle to craft one european voice nothing has proven to be a bigger set-back to europe 's dream of a common foreign policy than the iraq war .
while denmark , italy , spain and great britain rallied to america 's side , france , germany and belgium lead a coalition of eu nations vehemently opposed to the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members flags wave outside the zappeion conference hall , athens , greece , photo 2003/1 / 9 with fighting all but over , pro and anti-war europe is trying to find its way back to a happy middle .
recent meetings over postwar iraq between eu foreign ministers and blair and schröder are indications those intentions are honest . " it 's very central that germany , france and great britain come to an agreement , i think that 's also in the interest of blair and the transatlantic alliance , " said stefan fröhlich , a university of erlangen professor who just finished a stint at johns hopkins university 's center for transatlantic security in washington . " this german administration sees and recognizes the importance of getting that unified voice , " said fröhlich .
" not in the sense of fashioning a counterweight , but with the realization that we will achieve something in america when we speak with one voice . " the road to a unified european policy is filled with roadblocks , however . the loud talk about unified military ambitions - and a planned meeting on security policy with the leaders of france , germany , belgium and luxembourg in april - comes at a time when the eu is undergoing the greatest expansion in its history , welcoming even more voices and opinions into the already cacophonous body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , wednesday august 14,2002 .

" it will become a problem if the foreign policy program of germany is to play the old french gaullist card , trying to define itself and europe in opposition to the united states , " gedmin warned . most analysts agree that a healthy , strong relationship to the united states is necessary , but needs to be redefined . " they have to first find out how to deal with one another , " said peters of berlin 's free university . with the threat of atomic war gone and the iron curtain collapsed , the partners need new common interests , " and that 's not a process that can happen from one day to the next .

more than 10,000 police sought to maintain order , but violence – including molotav cocktail attacks – led to the arrest of at least 106 . five people were injured . but the protests failed to detract attention from the developments inside the summit , where attention focused on the eu 's imminent expansion and the difficult work of bringing iraq - which has languished under 12 years of u.n. sanctions and the crippling leadership of dictator saddam hussein - back on to the international stage . " the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .

more than 10,000 police sought to maintain order , but violence – including molotav cocktail attacks – led to the arrest of at least 106 . five people were injured . but the protests failed to detract attention from the developments inside the summit , where attention focused on the eu 's imminent expansion and the difficult work of bringing iraq - which has languished under 12 years of u.n. sanctions and the crippling leadership of dictator saddam hussein - back on to the international stage . " the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .

more than 10,000 police sought to maintain order , but violence – including molotav cocktail attacks – led to the arrest of at least 106 . five people were injured . but the protests failed to detract attention from the developments inside the summit , where attention focused on the eu 's imminent expansion and the difficult work of bringing iraq - which has languished under 12 years of u.n. sanctions and the crippling leadership of dictator saddam hussein - back on to the international stage . " the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .
however , many of the key leaders who attended the historical treaty signing in athens had already departed by thursday , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister jose maria aznar . in addition to the current 15 eu members and 10 accession states , all three candidate countries – turkey , romania and bulgaria – took place in the meeting along with albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro , the ukraine , russia , moldavia , switzerland , liechtenstein , norway and iceland . the declaration the following is the full-text of the eu declaration : " the european union welcomes the presence of the united nations secretary general and the opportunity to discuss with him the next steps on iraq .
" at this stage the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums .
" the people of iraq now have the chance to shape a new future for their country and to rejoin the international community .
" the international community has a major contribution to make in that process , in particular : · the u.n. must play a central role including in the process leading toward self-government for the iraqi people , enlisting its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict union building · iraq 's neighbors should support stability in iraq and the region · the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country · the eu welcomes the participation of the international financial institutions as set out in the recent statement by the g7 at the world bank meeting in washington " the eu welcomes the appointment by the u.n. secretary general of a special adviser on iraq and looks forward to a further strengthening of the u.n. 's involvement in post-conflict iraq , initially in the coordination of the humanitarian assistance .
" as part of the process of regional security and stability the eu reaffirms its commitments to bring the israeli-palestinian peace process to a successful conclusion through the implementation of the steps foreseen in the quartet 's -lsb- eu , us , un and russia -rsb- roadmap , keeping within established timelines .
" it is essential that there is an early endorsement by chairman arafat and the palestinian legislative council of a cabinet nominated by abu mazen and committed to reform . "

" but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .
however , many of the key leaders who attended the historical treaty signing in athens had already departed by thursday , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister jose maria aznar . in addition to the current 15 eu members and 10 accession states , all three candidate countries – turkey , romania and bulgaria – took place in the meeting along with albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro , the ukraine , russia , moldavia , switzerland , liechtenstein , norway and iceland . the declaration the following is the full-text of the eu declaration : " the european union welcomes the presence of the united nations secretary general and the opportunity to discuss with him the next steps on iraq .
" at this stage the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums .
" the people of iraq now have the chance to shape a new future for their country and to rejoin the international community .
" the international community has a major contribution to make in that process , in particular : · the u.n. must play a central role including in the process leading toward self-government for the iraqi people , enlisting its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict union building · iraq 's neighbors should support stability in iraq and the region · the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country · the eu welcomes the participation of the international financial institutions as set out in the recent statement by the g7 at the world bank meeting in washington " the eu welcomes the appointment by the u.n. secretary general of a special adviser on iraq and looks forward to a further strengthening of the u.n. 's involvement in post-conflict iraq , initially in the coordination of the humanitarian assistance .
" as part of the process of regional security and stability the eu reaffirms its commitments to bring the israeli-palestinian peace process to a successful conclusion through the implementation of the steps foreseen in the quartet 's -lsb- eu , us , un and russia -rsb- roadmap , keeping within established timelines .
" it is essential that there is an early endorsement by chairman arafat and the palestinian legislative council of a cabinet nominated by abu mazen and committed to reform . "

anti-american or anti-bush ? current affairs -pipe- 17.04.2003 iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's foreign policy is emerging from under the shadow of the cold war the strong fabric binding berlin and washington is fraying as german foreign policy undergoes a rapid transformation .
dw-world talks to analysts about where it 's headed next . with the german and british flags displayed neatly behind him , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday uttered the words that he hopes will heal the rift that iraq has opened within europe and across the atlantic . " no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " he said , following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , america ' strongest eu ally in the iraq war . foreign policy analysts in germany could n't agree more .
the iraq war marked the biggest step forward in a german foreign policy that has been growing out of the shadows of world war ii and the cold war . some see it as a positive part of germany 's political evolution since reunification 12 years ago .
to others , germany is treading a dangerous line by alienating the united states and putting its faith in the fledgling foreign policy of a fractious and unreliable europe . " i think this is a watershed , " said jens van scherpenberg , head of the transatlantic affairs department of the german institute for international and security affairs .
" the transatlantic alliance is not about to be what it was . " the decline of the u.s.-german relationship since just after sept .
11 , 2001 , when around 300,000 germans gathered in berlin 's tiergarten park to show their solidarity with the united states , relations between berlin and washington have taken a massive turn .
agreement with the u.s. in afghanistan turned to cautious criticism and then outright disagreement when the bush administration began agitating for a military invasion of iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer takes part in a moment of silence in front of the us embassy in berlin on thursday , september 13 , 2001 .
nationwide germans were taking part in a moment of silence at 10 a.m. in memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks in the united states . as the u.n. security council debated a u.s. and british demand to sanction military action against hussein 's regime in baghdad , germany partnered with france , russia and china to form a powerful anti-war alliance . the u.s.-british coalition eventually went to war without a u.n. resolution and american congressmen renamed their cafeteria french fries to " freedom " fries and vowed to strike back at former allies france and germany . " it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy . " what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . " dr. ingo peters , who heads the center on transatlantic foreign and security policy studies at berlin 's free university , said schröder 's team could have adopted a better tactic . " the problem is that the transatlantic relationship is n't just a bilateral relationship , it 's a multilateral relationship , " said peters .
" and so it 's not just the -lrb- german-american relationship -rrb- that has been damaged , it 's the european-american relationship as well . " the battle to craft one european voice nothing has proven to be a bigger set-back to europe 's dream of a common foreign policy than the iraq war .
while denmark , italy , spain and great britain rallied to america 's side , france , germany and belgium lead a coalition of eu nations vehemently opposed to the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members flags wave outside the zappeion conference hall , athens , greece , photo 2003/1 / 9 with fighting all but over , pro and anti-war europe is trying to find its way back to a happy middle .
recent meetings over postwar iraq between eu foreign ministers and blair and schröder are indications those intentions are honest . " it 's very central that germany , france and great britain come to an agreement , i think that 's also in the interest of blair and the transatlantic alliance , " said stefan fröhlich , a university of erlangen professor who just finished a stint at johns hopkins university 's center for transatlantic security in washington . " this german administration sees and recognizes the importance of getting that unified voice , " said fröhlich .
" not in the sense of fashioning a counterweight , but with the realization that we will achieve something in america when we speak with one voice . " the road to a unified european policy is filled with roadblocks , however . the loud talk about unified military ambitions - and a planned meeting on security policy with the leaders of france , germany , belgium and luxembourg in april - comes at a time when the eu is undergoing the greatest expansion in its history , welcoming even more voices and opinions into the already cacophonous body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , wednesday august 14,2002 .

" it will become a problem if the foreign policy program of germany is to play the old french gaullist card , trying to define itself and europe in opposition to the united states , " gedmin warned . most analysts agree that a healthy , strong relationship to the united states is necessary , but needs to be redefined . " they have to first find out how to deal with one another , " said peters of berlin 's free university . with the threat of atomic war gone and the iron curtain collapsed , the partners need new common interests , " and that 's not a process that can happen from one day to the next .

more than 10,000 police sought to maintain order , but violence – including molotav cocktail attacks – led to the arrest of at least 106 . five people were injured . but the protests failed to detract attention from the developments inside the summit , where attention focused on the eu 's imminent expansion and the difficult work of bringing iraq - which has languished under 12 years of u.n. sanctions and the crippling leadership of dictator saddam hussein - back on to the international stage . " the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .
however , many of the key leaders who attended the historical treaty signing in athens had already departed by thursday , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister jose maria aznar . in addition to the current 15 eu members and 10 accession states , all three candidate countries – turkey , romania and bulgaria – took place in the meeting along with albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro , the ukraine , russia , moldavia , switzerland , liechtenstein , norway and iceland . the declaration the following is the full-text of the eu declaration : " the european union welcomes the presence of the united nations secretary general and the opportunity to discuss with him the next steps on iraq .
" at this stage the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums .
" the people of iraq now have the chance to shape a new future for their country and to rejoin the international community .
" the international community has a major contribution to make in that process , in particular : · the u.n. must play a central role including in the process leading toward self-government for the iraqi people , enlisting its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict union building · iraq 's neighbors should support stability in iraq and the region · the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country · the eu welcomes the participation of the international financial institutions as set out in the recent statement by the g7 at the world bank meeting in washington " the eu welcomes the appointment by the u.n. secretary general of a special adviser on iraq and looks forward to a further strengthening of the u.n. 's involvement in post-conflict iraq , initially in the coordination of the humanitarian assistance .
" as part of the process of regional security and stability the eu reaffirms its commitments to bring the israeli-palestinian peace process to a successful conclusion through the implementation of the steps foreseen in the quartet 's -lsb- eu , us , un and russia -rsb- roadmap , keeping within established timelines .

" the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .
however , many of the key leaders who attended the historical treaty signing in athens had already departed by thursday , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister jose maria aznar . in addition to the current 15 eu members and 10 accession states , all three candidate countries – turkey , romania and bulgaria – took place in the meeting along with albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro , the ukraine , russia , moldavia , switzerland , liechtenstein , norway and iceland . the declaration the following is the full-text of the eu declaration : " the european union welcomes the presence of the united nations secretary general and the opportunity to discuss with him the next steps on iraq .
" at this stage the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums .
" the people of iraq now have the chance to shape a new future for their country and to rejoin the international community .
" the international community has a major contribution to make in that process , in particular : · the u.n. must play a central role including in the process leading toward self-government for the iraqi people , enlisting its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict union building · iraq 's neighbors should support stability in iraq and the region · the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country · the eu welcomes the participation of the international financial institutions as set out in the recent statement by the g7 at the world bank meeting in washington " the eu welcomes the appointment by the u.n. secretary general of a special adviser on iraq and looks forward to a further strengthening of the u.n. 's involvement in post-conflict iraq , initially in the coordination of the humanitarian assistance .
" as part of the process of regional security and stability the eu reaffirms its commitments to bring the israeli-palestinian peace process to a successful conclusion through the implementation of the steps foreseen in the quartet 's -lsb- eu , us , un and russia -rsb- roadmap , keeping within established timelines .
" it is essential that there is an early endorsement by chairman arafat and the palestinian legislative council of a cabinet nominated by abu mazen and committed to reform . "

anti-american or anti-bush ? current affairs -pipe- 17.04.2003 iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's foreign policy is emerging from under the shadow of the cold war the strong fabric binding berlin and washington is fraying as german foreign policy undergoes a rapid transformation .
dw-world talks to analysts about where it 's headed next . with the german and british flags displayed neatly behind him , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday uttered the words that he hopes will heal the rift that iraq has opened within europe and across the atlantic . " no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " he said , following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , america ' strongest eu ally in the iraq war . foreign policy analysts in germany could n't agree more .
the iraq war marked the biggest step forward in a german foreign policy that has been growing out of the shadows of world war ii and the cold war . some see it as a positive part of germany 's political evolution since reunification 12 years ago .
to others , germany is treading a dangerous line by alienating the united states and putting its faith in the fledgling foreign policy of a fractious and unreliable europe . " i think this is a watershed , " said jens van scherpenberg , head of the transatlantic affairs department of the german institute for international and security affairs .
" the transatlantic alliance is not about to be what it was . " the decline of the u.s.-german relationship since just after sept .
11 , 2001 , when around 300,000 germans gathered in berlin 's tiergarten park to show their solidarity with the united states , relations between berlin and washington have taken a massive turn .
agreement with the u.s. in afghanistan turned to cautious criticism and then outright disagreement when the bush administration began agitating for a military invasion of iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer takes part in a moment of silence in front of the us embassy in berlin on thursday , september 13 , 2001 .
nationwide germans were taking part in a moment of silence at 10 a.m. in memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks in the united states . as the u.n. security council debated a u.s. and british demand to sanction military action against hussein 's regime in baghdad , germany partnered with france , russia and china to form a powerful anti-war alliance . the u.s.-british coalition eventually went to war without a u.n. resolution and american congressmen renamed their cafeteria french fries to " freedom " fries and vowed to strike back at former allies france and germany . " it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy . " what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions .

anti-american or anti-bush ? current affairs -pipe- 17.04.2003 iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's foreign policy is emerging from under the shadow of the cold war the strong fabric binding berlin and washington is fraying as german foreign policy undergoes a rapid transformation .
dw-world talks to analysts about where it 's headed next . with the german and british flags displayed neatly behind him , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday uttered the words that he hopes will heal the rift that iraq has opened within europe and across the atlantic . " no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " he said , following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , america ' strongest eu ally in the iraq war . foreign policy analysts in germany could n't agree more .
the iraq war marked the biggest step forward in a german foreign policy that has been growing out of the shadows of world war ii and the cold war . some see it as a positive part of germany 's political evolution since reunification 12 years ago .
to others , germany is treading a dangerous line by alienating the united states and putting its faith in the fledgling foreign policy of a fractious and unreliable europe . " i think this is a watershed , " said jens van scherpenberg , head of the transatlantic affairs department of the german institute for international and security affairs .
" the transatlantic alliance is not about to be what it was . " the decline of the u.s.-german relationship since just after sept .
11 , 2001 , when around 300,000 germans gathered in berlin 's tiergarten park to show their solidarity with the united states , relations between berlin and washington have taken a massive turn .
agreement with the u.s. in afghanistan turned to cautious criticism and then outright disagreement when the bush administration began agitating for a military invasion of iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer takes part in a moment of silence in front of the us embassy in berlin on thursday , september 13 , 2001 .
nationwide germans were taking part in a moment of silence at 10 a.m. in memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks in the united states . as the u.n. security council debated a u.s. and british demand to sanction military action against hussein 's regime in baghdad , germany partnered with france , russia and china to form a powerful anti-war alliance . the u.s.-british coalition eventually went to war without a u.n. resolution and american congressmen renamed their cafeteria french fries to " freedom " fries and vowed to strike back at former allies france and germany . " it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy . " what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . " dr. ingo peters , who heads the center on transatlantic foreign and security policy studies at berlin 's free university , said schröder 's team could have adopted a better tactic . " the problem is that the transatlantic relationship is n't just a bilateral relationship , it 's a multilateral relationship , " said peters .
" and so it 's not just the -lrb- german-american relationship -rrb- that has been damaged , it 's the european-american relationship as well . " the battle to craft one european voice nothing has proven to be a bigger set-back to europe 's dream of a common foreign policy than the iraq war .
while denmark , italy , spain and great britain rallied to america 's side , france , germany and belgium lead a coalition of eu nations vehemently opposed to the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members flags wave outside the zappeion conference hall , athens , greece , photo 2003/1 / 9 with fighting all but over , pro and anti-war europe is trying to find its way back to a happy middle .
recent meetings over postwar iraq between eu foreign ministers and blair and schröder are indications those intentions are honest . " it 's very central that germany , france and great britain come to an agreement , i think that 's also in the interest of blair and the transatlantic alliance , " said stefan fröhlich , a university of erlangen professor who just finished a stint at johns hopkins university 's center for transatlantic security in washington . " this german administration sees and recognizes the importance of getting that unified voice , " said fröhlich .
" not in the sense of fashioning a counterweight , but with the realization that we will achieve something in america when we speak with one voice . " the road to a unified european policy is filled with roadblocks , however . the loud talk about unified military ambitions - and a planned meeting on security policy with the leaders of france , germany , belgium and luxembourg in april - comes at a time when the eu is undergoing the greatest expansion in its history , welcoming even more voices and opinions into the already cacophonous body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , wednesday august 14,2002 .

" it will become a problem if the foreign policy program of germany is to play the old french gaullist card , trying to define itself and europe in opposition to the united states , " gedmin warned . most analysts agree that a healthy , strong relationship to the united states is necessary , but needs to be redefined . " they have to first find out how to deal with one another , " said peters of berlin 's free university . with the threat of atomic war gone and the iron curtain collapsed , the partners need new common interests , " and that 's not a process that can happen from one day to the next .

more than 10,000 police sought to maintain order , but violence – including molotav cocktail attacks – led to the arrest of at least 106 . five people were injured . but the protests failed to detract attention from the developments inside the summit , where attention focused on the eu 's imminent expansion and the difficult work of bringing iraq - which has languished under 12 years of u.n. sanctions and the crippling leadership of dictator saddam hussein - back on to the international stage . " the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .
however , many of the key leaders who attended the historical treaty signing in athens had already departed by thursday , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister jose maria aznar . in addition to the current 15 eu members and 10 accession states , all three candidate countries – turkey , romania and bulgaria – took place in the meeting along with albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro , the ukraine , russia , moldavia , switzerland , liechtenstein , norway and iceland . the declaration the following is the full-text of the eu declaration : " the european union welcomes the presence of the united nations secretary general and the opportunity to discuss with him the next steps on iraq .

after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .
however , many of the key leaders who attended the historical treaty signing in athens had already departed by thursday , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister jose maria aznar . in addition to the current 15 eu members and 10 accession states , all three candidate countries – turkey , romania and bulgaria – took place in the meeting along with albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro , the ukraine , russia , moldavia , switzerland , liechtenstein , norway and iceland . the declaration the following is the full-text of the eu declaration : " the european union welcomes the presence of the united nations secretary general and the opportunity to discuss with him the next steps on iraq .
" at this stage the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums .
" the people of iraq now have the chance to shape a new future for their country and to rejoin the international community .
" the international community has a major contribution to make in that process , in particular : · the u.n. must play a central role including in the process leading toward self-government for the iraqi people , enlisting its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict union building · iraq 's neighbors should support stability in iraq and the region · the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country · the eu welcomes the participation of the international financial institutions as set out in the recent statement by the g7 at the world bank meeting in washington " the eu welcomes the appointment by the u.n. secretary general of a special adviser on iraq and looks forward to a further strengthening of the u.n. 's involvement in post-conflict iraq , initially in the coordination of the humanitarian assistance .
" as part of the process of regional security and stability the eu reaffirms its commitments to bring the israeli-palestinian peace process to a successful conclusion through the implementation of the steps foreseen in the quartet 's -lsb- eu , us , un and russia -rsb- roadmap , keeping within established timelines .

anti-american or anti-bush ? current affairs -pipe- 17.04.2003 iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's foreign policy is emerging from under the shadow of the cold war the strong fabric binding berlin and washington is fraying as german foreign policy undergoes a rapid transformation .
dw-world talks to analysts about where it 's headed next . with the german and british flags displayed neatly behind him , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday uttered the words that he hopes will heal the rift that iraq has opened within europe and across the atlantic . " no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " he said , following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , america ' strongest eu ally in the iraq war . foreign policy analysts in germany could n't agree more .
the iraq war marked the biggest step forward in a german foreign policy that has been growing out of the shadows of world war ii and the cold war . some see it as a positive part of germany 's political evolution since reunification 12 years ago .
to others , germany is treading a dangerous line by alienating the united states and putting its faith in the fledgling foreign policy of a fractious and unreliable europe . " i think this is a watershed , " said jens van scherpenberg , head of the transatlantic affairs department of the german institute for international and security affairs .
" the transatlantic alliance is not about to be what it was . " the decline of the u.s.-german relationship since just after sept .
11 , 2001 , when around 300,000 germans gathered in berlin 's tiergarten park to show their solidarity with the united states , relations between berlin and washington have taken a massive turn .
agreement with the u.s. in afghanistan turned to cautious criticism and then outright disagreement when the bush administration began agitating for a military invasion of iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer takes part in a moment of silence in front of the us embassy in berlin on thursday , september 13 , 2001 .
nationwide germans were taking part in a moment of silence at 10 a.m. in memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks in the united states . as the u.n. security council debated a u.s. and british demand to sanction military action against hussein 's regime in baghdad , germany partnered with france , russia and china to form a powerful anti-war alliance . the u.s.-british coalition eventually went to war without a u.n. resolution and american congressmen renamed their cafeteria french fries to " freedom " fries and vowed to strike back at former allies france and germany . " it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy . " what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . " dr. ingo peters , who heads the center on transatlantic foreign and security policy studies at berlin 's free university , said schröder 's team could have adopted a better tactic . " the problem is that the transatlantic relationship is n't just a bilateral relationship , it 's a multilateral relationship , " said peters .
" and so it 's not just the -lrb- german-american relationship -rrb- that has been damaged , it 's the european-american relationship as well . " the battle to craft one european voice nothing has proven to be a bigger set-back to europe 's dream of a common foreign policy than the iraq war .
while denmark , italy , spain and great britain rallied to america 's side , france , germany and belgium lead a coalition of eu nations vehemently opposed to the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members flags wave outside the zappeion conference hall , athens , greece , photo 2003/1 / 9 with fighting all but over , pro and anti-war europe is trying to find its way back to a happy middle .
recent meetings over postwar iraq between eu foreign ministers and blair and schröder are indications those intentions are honest . " it 's very central that germany , france and great britain come to an agreement , i think that 's also in the interest of blair and the transatlantic alliance , " said stefan fröhlich , a university of erlangen professor who just finished a stint at johns hopkins university 's center for transatlantic security in washington . " this german administration sees and recognizes the importance of getting that unified voice , " said fröhlich .
" not in the sense of fashioning a counterweight , but with the realization that we will achieve something in america when we speak with one voice . " the road to a unified european policy is filled with roadblocks , however . the loud talk about unified military ambitions - and a planned meeting on security policy with the leaders of france , germany , belgium and luxembourg in april - comes at a time when the eu is undergoing the greatest expansion in its history , welcoming even more voices and opinions into the already cacophonous body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , wednesday august 14,2002 .

" it will become a problem if the foreign policy program of germany is to play the old french gaullist card , trying to define itself and europe in opposition to the united states , " gedmin warned . most analysts agree that a healthy , strong relationship to the united states is necessary , but needs to be redefined . " they have to first find out how to deal with one another , " said peters of berlin 's free university . with the threat of atomic war gone and the iron curtain collapsed , the partners need new common interests , " and that 's not a process that can happen from one day to the next .

more than 10,000 police sought to maintain order , but violence – including molotav cocktail attacks – led to the arrest of at least 106 . five people were injured . but the protests failed to detract attention from the developments inside the summit , where attention focused on the eu 's imminent expansion and the difficult work of bringing iraq - which has languished under 12 years of u.n. sanctions and the crippling leadership of dictator saddam hussein - back on to the international stage . " the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .

he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .

more than 10,000 police sought to maintain order , but violence – including molotav cocktail attacks – led to the arrest of at least 106 . five people were injured . but the protests failed to detract attention from the developments inside the summit , where attention focused on the eu 's imminent expansion and the difficult work of bringing iraq - which has languished under 12 years of u.n. sanctions and the crippling leadership of dictator saddam hussein - back on to the international stage . " the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .
however , many of the key leaders who attended the historical treaty signing in athens had already departed by thursday , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister jose maria aznar . in addition to the current 15 eu members and 10 accession states , all three candidate countries – turkey , romania and bulgaria – took place in the meeting along with albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro , the ukraine , russia , moldavia , switzerland , liechtenstein , norway and iceland . the declaration the following is the full-text of the eu declaration : " the european union welcomes the presence of the united nations secretary general and the opportunity to discuss with him the next steps on iraq .
" at this stage the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums .
" the people of iraq now have the chance to shape a new future for their country and to rejoin the international community .
" the international community has a major contribution to make in that process , in particular : · the u.n. must play a central role including in the process leading toward self-government for the iraqi people , enlisting its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict union building · iraq 's neighbors should support stability in iraq and the region · the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country · the eu welcomes the participation of the international financial institutions as set out in the recent statement by the g7 at the world bank meeting in washington " the eu welcomes the appointment by the u.n. secretary general of a special adviser on iraq and looks forward to a further strengthening of the u.n. 's involvement in post-conflict iraq , initially in the coordination of the humanitarian assistance .
" as part of the process of regional security and stability the eu reaffirms its commitments to bring the israeli-palestinian peace process to a successful conclusion through the implementation of the steps foreseen in the quartet 's -lsb- eu , us , un and russia -rsb- roadmap , keeping within established timelines .
" it is essential that there is an early endorsement by chairman arafat and the palestinian legislative council of a cabinet nominated by abu mazen and committed to reform . "

" and so it 's not just the -lrb- german-american relationship -rrb- that has been damaged , it 's the european-american relationship as well . " the battle to craft one european voice nothing has proven to be a bigger set-back to europe 's dream of a common foreign policy than the iraq war .
while denmark , italy , spain and great britain rallied to america 's side , france , germany and belgium lead a coalition of eu nations vehemently opposed to the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members flags wave outside the zappeion conference hall , athens , greece , photo 2003/1 / 9 with fighting all but over , pro and anti-war europe is trying to find its way back to a happy middle .
recent meetings over postwar iraq between eu foreign ministers and blair and schröder are indications those intentions are honest . " it 's very central that germany , france and great britain come to an agreement , i think that 's also in the interest of blair and the transatlantic alliance , " said stefan fröhlich , a university of erlangen professor who just finished a stint at johns hopkins university 's center for transatlantic security in washington . " this german administration sees and recognizes the importance of getting that unified voice , " said fröhlich .
" not in the sense of fashioning a counterweight , but with the realization that we will achieve something in america when we speak with one voice . " the road to a unified european policy is filled with roadblocks , however . the loud talk about unified military ambitions - and a planned meeting on security policy with the leaders of france , germany , belgium and luxembourg in april - comes at a time when the eu is undergoing the greatest expansion in its history , welcoming even more voices and opinions into the already cacophonous body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , wednesday august 14,2002 .

" it will become a problem if the foreign policy program of germany is to play the old french gaullist card , trying to define itself and europe in opposition to the united states , " gedmin warned . most analysts agree that a healthy , strong relationship to the united states is necessary , but needs to be redefined . " they have to first find out how to deal with one another , " said peters of berlin 's free university . with the threat of atomic war gone and the iron curtain collapsed , the partners need new common interests , " and that 's not a process that can happen from one day to the next .

more than 10,000 police sought to maintain order , but violence – including molotav cocktail attacks – led to the arrest of at least 106 . five people were injured . but the protests failed to detract attention from the developments inside the summit , where attention focused on the eu 's imminent expansion and the difficult work of bringing iraq - which has languished under 12 years of u.n. sanctions and the crippling leadership of dictator saddam hussein - back on to the international stage . " the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .
however , many of the key leaders who attended the historical treaty signing in athens had already departed by thursday , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister jose maria aznar . in addition to the current 15 eu members and 10 accession states , all three candidate countries – turkey , romania and bulgaria – took place in the meeting along with albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro , the ukraine , russia , moldavia , switzerland , liechtenstein , norway and iceland . the declaration the following is the full-text of the eu declaration : " the european union welcomes the presence of the united nations secretary general and the opportunity to discuss with him the next steps on iraq .

more than 10,000 police sought to maintain order , but violence – including molotav cocktail attacks – led to the arrest of at least 106 . five people were injured . but the protests failed to detract attention from the developments inside the summit , where attention focused on the eu 's imminent expansion and the difficult work of bringing iraq - which has languished under 12 years of u.n. sanctions and the crippling leadership of dictator saddam hussein - back on to the international stage . " the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .
however , many of the key leaders who attended the historical treaty signing in athens had already departed by thursday , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister jose maria aznar . in addition to the current 15 eu members and 10 accession states , all three candidate countries – turkey , romania and bulgaria – took place in the meeting along with albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro , the ukraine , russia , moldavia , switzerland , liechtenstein , norway and iceland . the declaration the following is the full-text of the eu declaration : " the european union welcomes the presence of the united nations secretary general and the opportunity to discuss with him the next steps on iraq .
" at this stage the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums .
" the people of iraq now have the chance to shape a new future for their country and to rejoin the international community .
" the international community has a major contribution to make in that process , in particular : · the u.n. must play a central role including in the process leading toward self-government for the iraqi people , enlisting its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict union building · iraq 's neighbors should support stability in iraq and the region · the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country · the eu welcomes the participation of the international financial institutions as set out in the recent statement by the g7 at the world bank meeting in washington " the eu welcomes the appointment by the u.n. secretary general of a special adviser on iraq and looks forward to a further strengthening of the u.n. 's involvement in post-conflict iraq , initially in the coordination of the humanitarian assistance .
" as part of the process of regional security and stability the eu reaffirms its commitments to bring the israeli-palestinian peace process to a successful conclusion through the implementation of the steps foreseen in the quartet 's -lsb- eu , us , un and russia -rsb- roadmap , keeping within established timelines .
" it is essential that there is an early endorsement by chairman arafat and the palestinian legislative council of a cabinet nominated by abu mazen and committed to reform . "

more than 10,000 police sought to maintain order , but violence – including molotav cocktail attacks – led to the arrest of at least 106 . five people were injured . but the protests failed to detract attention from the developments inside the summit , where attention focused on the eu 's imminent expansion and the difficult work of bringing iraq - which has languished under 12 years of u.n. sanctions and the crippling leadership of dictator saddam hussein - back on to the international stage . " the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .

dw-world talks to analysts about where it 's headed next . with the german and british flags displayed neatly behind him , chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday uttered the words that he hopes will heal the rift that iraq has opened within europe and across the atlantic . " no matter what the difference of opinions were before , it goes without saying that healthy transatlantic relations are necessary and we 'll work towards that aim in the future , " he said , following a meeting with british prime minister tony blair , america ' strongest eu ally in the iraq war . foreign policy analysts in germany could n't agree more .
the iraq war marked the biggest step forward in a german foreign policy that has been growing out of the shadows of world war ii and the cold war . some see it as a positive part of germany 's political evolution since reunification 12 years ago .
to others , germany is treading a dangerous line by alienating the united states and putting its faith in the fledgling foreign policy of a fractious and unreliable europe . " i think this is a watershed , " said jens van scherpenberg , head of the transatlantic affairs department of the german institute for international and security affairs .
" the transatlantic alliance is not about to be what it was . " the decline of the u.s.-german relationship since just after sept .
11 , 2001 , when around 300,000 germans gathered in berlin 's tiergarten park to show their solidarity with the united states , relations between berlin and washington have taken a massive turn .
agreement with the u.s. in afghanistan turned to cautious criticism and then outright disagreement when the bush administration began agitating for a military invasion of iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german police officer takes part in a moment of silence in front of the us embassy in berlin on thursday , september 13 , 2001 .
nationwide germans were taking part in a moment of silence at 10 a.m. in memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks in the united states . as the u.n. security council debated a u.s. and british demand to sanction military action against hussein 's regime in baghdad , germany partnered with france , russia and china to form a powerful anti-war alliance . the u.s.-british coalition eventually went to war without a u.n. resolution and american congressmen renamed their cafeteria french fries to " freedom " fries and vowed to strike back at former allies france and germany . " it 's not just what they -lrb- the germans -rrb- did , but how they did it , " said jeffrey gedmin , director of the aspen institute in berlin and an outspoken critic of the german government 's iraq policy . " what does it mean when … an ally like germany is not just prepared to abstain but to actively , energetically and systematically … contribute to the failure of our mission ?
it makes people ask if that 's the way an ally functions . " dr. ingo peters , who heads the center on transatlantic foreign and security policy studies at berlin 's free university , said schröder 's team could have adopted a better tactic . " the problem is that the transatlantic relationship is n't just a bilateral relationship , it 's a multilateral relationship , " said peters .
" and so it 's not just the -lrb- german-american relationship -rrb- that has been damaged , it 's the european-american relationship as well . " the battle to craft one european voice nothing has proven to be a bigger set-back to europe 's dream of a common foreign policy than the iraq war .
while denmark , italy , spain and great britain rallied to america 's side , france , germany and belgium lead a coalition of eu nations vehemently opposed to the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu members flags wave outside the zappeion conference hall , athens , greece , photo 2003/1 / 9 with fighting all but over , pro and anti-war europe is trying to find its way back to a happy middle .
recent meetings over postwar iraq between eu foreign ministers and blair and schröder are indications those intentions are honest . " it 's very central that germany , france and great britain come to an agreement , i think that 's also in the interest of blair and the transatlantic alliance , " said stefan fröhlich , a university of erlangen professor who just finished a stint at johns hopkins university 's center for transatlantic security in washington . " this german administration sees and recognizes the importance of getting that unified voice , " said fröhlich .
" not in the sense of fashioning a counterweight , but with the realization that we will achieve something in america when we speak with one voice . " the road to a unified european policy is filled with roadblocks , however . the loud talk about unified military ambitions - and a planned meeting on security policy with the leaders of france , germany , belgium and luxembourg in april - comes at a time when the eu is undergoing the greatest expansion in its history , welcoming even more voices and opinions into the already cacophonous body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , wednesday august 14,2002 .

more than 10,000 police sought to maintain order , but violence – including molotav cocktail attacks – led to the arrest of at least 106 . five people were injured . but the protests failed to detract attention from the developments inside the summit , where attention focused on the eu 's imminent expansion and the difficult work of bringing iraq - which has languished under 12 years of u.n. sanctions and the crippling leadership of dictator saddam hussein - back on to the international stage . " the u.n. must play a central role , including in the process leading towards self-government for the iraqi people , utilizing its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict nation building , " the statement , released by the eu 's greek presidency , said .
greece , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency and is hosting the summit , originally intended to release the text on wednesday - but negotiations over the language with member states continued into the night .
the statement was drafted by britain , germany , france and spain – countries that until several days ago were at loggerheads over the war in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw " what we are doing is talking about the new iraq , " said british foreign secretary jack straw -lrb- photo , right -rrb- .
" we are trying to put behind us the argument about whether or not the coalition should have taken military action . " but the statement also admonished the coalition leading the war in iraq , urging it to put a stop to the mass looting and crime that has ravaged iraq and dominated media coverage in recent days – from the plundering of baghdad 's historical treasures to the ransacking of government offices .
the eu statement urged the forces to clamp down and restore order .
" at this stage , the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums . " pragmatic questions german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- greeted the show of unity on thursday , but also warned that the u.n. security council must now act quickly to assume its postwar role .
" a number of pragmatic questions have been raised that need to be addressed at the level of the u.n. security council , " he said on thursday at the close of the summit .
he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .
however , many of the key leaders who attended the historical treaty signing in athens had already departed by thursday , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister jose maria aznar . in addition to the current 15 eu members and 10 accession states , all three candidate countries – turkey , romania and bulgaria – took place in the meeting along with albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro , the ukraine , russia , moldavia , switzerland , liechtenstein , norway and iceland . the declaration the following is the full-text of the eu declaration : " the european union welcomes the presence of the united nations secretary general and the opportunity to discuss with him the next steps on iraq .
" at this stage the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums .
" the people of iraq now have the chance to shape a new future for their country and to rejoin the international community .
" the international community has a major contribution to make in that process , in particular : · the u.n. must play a central role including in the process leading toward self-government for the iraqi people , enlisting its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict union building · iraq 's neighbors should support stability in iraq and the region · the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country · the eu welcomes the participation of the international financial institutions as set out in the recent statement by the g7 at the world bank meeting in washington " the eu welcomes the appointment by the u.n. secretary general of a special adviser on iraq and looks forward to a further strengthening of the u.n. 's involvement in post-conflict iraq , initially in the coordination of the humanitarian assistance .
" as part of the process of regional security and stability the eu reaffirms its commitments to bring the israeli-palestinian peace process to a successful conclusion through the implementation of the steps foreseen in the quartet 's -lsb- eu , us , un and russia -rsb- roadmap , keeping within established timelines .
" it is essential that there is an early endorsement by chairman arafat and the palestinian legislative council of a cabinet nominated by abu mazen and committed to reform . "

he said a number of decisions must be made " under the umbrella of the united nations . " fischer also admonished u.s. and british-led forces in iraq to restore peace and civil order in order to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian relief , but he also called on the u.n. to act quickly .
" the u.n. has to play a central role – also in the development of an independent government of the iraqi people . " lifting sanctions though the issue of lifting u.n. sanctions against iraq was a prominent theme at the summit , there was no specific mention of it in the statement .
on wednesday , u.s. president george w. bush called on the united nations to waive sanctions against iraq .
but on thursday , european leaders hinted they might not do so as quickly as washington might be expecting .
the hitch is that the u.n. currently controls iraqi oil sales , and suspension of sanctions would put into question who manages the country 's oil resources . european leaders welcomed the idea of eventually lifting the sanctions , but , according to reuters used terms like " conditions " and " modalities " to describe the circumstances of suspending them .
after meeting with u.n. secretary general kofi annan , french president jacques chirac signaled his support for lifting sanctions , saying : " now it is up to the united nations to define the modalities of the lifting of sanctions . " at least two eu members – denmark and the netherlands – said they were considering offering peacekeeping troops for an iraq mission .
the statements came just as the u.s. sent a request to denmark to build a 3,000-strong international security force to help maintain order in iraq as it is rebuilt . european leaders also called for the implementation of the " road map " for peace in israel and areas controlled by the palestinian authorities created by the so-called middle east quartet , made up of the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations . new europe meets its neighbors on wednesday , 10 mostly eastern european countries signed the treaty of accession , paving the way for their eu membership starting in 2004 .
the move marks the greatest expansion in the eu 's history , from its modest beginnings with six members in 1951 as the european coal and steel community in 1951 to what will be a union with a population of over 450 million next year . one day later , more than 40 european countries met in athens to discuss the geopolitical implications for the region and increase cooperative efforts .
however , many of the key leaders who attended the historical treaty signing in athens had already departed by thursday , including german chancellor gerhard schröder , british prime minister tony blair and spanish prime minister jose maria aznar . in addition to the current 15 eu members and 10 accession states , all three candidate countries – turkey , romania and bulgaria – took place in the meeting along with albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro , the ukraine , russia , moldavia , switzerland , liechtenstein , norway and iceland . the declaration the following is the full-text of the eu declaration : " the european union welcomes the presence of the united nations secretary general and the opportunity to discuss with him the next steps on iraq .
" at this stage the coalition has the responsibility to ensure a secure environment , including for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the protection of the cultural heritage and museums .
" the people of iraq now have the chance to shape a new future for their country and to rejoin the international community .
" the international community has a major contribution to make in that process , in particular : · the u.n. must play a central role including in the process leading toward self-government for the iraqi people , enlisting its unique capacity and experience in post-conflict union building · iraq 's neighbors should support stability in iraq and the region · the eu reaffirms its commitments to play a significant role in the political and economic reconstruction of the country · the eu welcomes the participation of the international financial institutions as set out in the recent statement by the g7 at the world bank meeting in washington " the eu welcomes the appointment by the u.n. secretary general of a special adviser on iraq and looks forward to a further strengthening of the u.n. 's involvement in post-conflict iraq , initially in the coordination of the humanitarian assistance .
" as part of the process of regional security and stability the eu reaffirms its commitments to bring the israeli-palestinian peace process to a successful conclusion through the implementation of the steps foreseen in the quartet 's -lsb- eu , us , un and russia -rsb- roadmap , keeping within established timelines .
" it is essential that there is an early endorsement by chairman arafat and the palestinian legislative council of a cabinet nominated by abu mazen and committed to reform . "

under the restructuring , new boeings and airbuses are to replace ageing soviet-designed craft in the airline 's 110-plus fleet .
its current livery of red , blue and white is being ditched for blue , orange and silver , with a stylish russian flag draped across the tail .
and inside the cabin , decor and crew uniforms are being redesigned , and improvements made to service and food .
however the company is reluctant to retire the 70-year old hammer and sickle symbol .
" this is an old russian brand , which everyone associates with aeroflot .
this logo is so harmonious that is has proved difficult to replace , " aeroflot 's deputy director general , lev koshlyakov , told the french news agency afp .
negative perceptions the airline , founded in 1923 , said in december it would drop the hammer and sickle on the advice of its image consultant , identica .
aeroflot , which flies to more than 100 destinations , is trying to change decades of negative perceptions of poor safety and service to compete more effectively in the international marketplace .
market research abroad had indicated support for the logo change , with customers apparently finding that the soviet-era symbol had bad associations .
but in case the airline 's management has a change of heart , the old logo is being replaced with a removable sticker on all the planes .
