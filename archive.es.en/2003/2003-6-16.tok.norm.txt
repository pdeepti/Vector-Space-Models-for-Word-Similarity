as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .
the most often cited possibilities for a first major case are war crimes in the republic of congo , sierra leone and colombia , but few believe any case will be accepted before 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wrangles over international court highlight transatlantic rift the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a340-600 .
there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .
u.s. presence scaled back amid rows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acrobatics ... but not from the americans .
boeing ’ s sedated foray into the expected rivallry at the event was indicative of the scaled down american presence at the 45th paris air show .
u.s. participation this year has been sharply reduced and , for the first time , no u.s. military plane will perform in the sky .
the pentagon has banned the traditional aerial displays by its military pilots in what is widely seen as a deliberate snub to the french with only 6 planes from the united states making an appearance on the ground at le bourget .
relations between the countries have been at an all-time low since the u.s.-led war in iraq , a military invasion france condemned .
to make matters worse between the two nations , french defence minister michele alliot-marie announced on saturday in the french newspaper le monde that she had asked for " a study of the risks " that u.s. investments could represent in companies linked to european defense .
in her interview , timed to coincide with the the air show , alliot-marie urged european firms to stand together to resist what she called the united states ’ " true preoccupation " to take over european defense concerns .
" american industrialists are pursuing a logic of economic war , " she said .
" the french defense minister is entitled to her own opinion , " said u.s. defense department spokesperson jim turner in response .
" however , her opinion does not accurately characterize the policy or position of the secretary of defense , or the position of the u.s. government .

however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a340-600 .
there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .
u.s. presence scaled back amid rows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acrobatics ... but not from the americans .
boeing ’ s sedated foray into the expected rivallry at the event was indicative of the scaled down american presence at the 45th paris air show .
u.s. participation this year has been sharply reduced and , for the first time , no u.s. military plane will perform in the sky .
the pentagon has banned the traditional aerial displays by its military pilots in what is widely seen as a deliberate snub to the french with only 6 planes from the united states making an appearance on the ground at le bourget .
relations between the countries have been at an all-time low since the u.s.-led war in iraq , a military invasion france condemned .
to make matters worse between the two nations , french defence minister michele alliot-marie announced on saturday in the french newspaper le monde that she had asked for " a study of the risks " that u.s. investments could represent in companies linked to european defense .
in her interview , timed to coincide with the the air show , alliot-marie urged european firms to stand together to resist what she called the united states ’ " true preoccupation " to take over european defense concerns .
" american industrialists are pursuing a logic of economic war , " she said .
" the french defense minister is entitled to her own opinion , " said u.s. defense department spokesperson jim turner in response .
" however , her opinion does not accurately characterize the policy or position of the secretary of defense , or the position of the u.s. government .

the list of signatories reads like a who ’ s who of european politics from the last 20 years : former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , spain 's ex-prime minister felipe gonzalez and two former german chancellors – including kohl – all backed the initiative . the letter , which appeared simultaneously in the french newspaper " le monde " and the italian newspaper " corriere della sera " , stressed the importance of maintaining good ties between europe and the united states .
under the title " never against america , " the former heads of state said it was time to put aside the differences which arose in the wake of the u.s.-led war on iraq .
transatlantic cooperation since the war in iraq , " the unity of the western world has been openly questioned , " the former leaders lamented and criticized the damaging tone of the current transatlantic debate which encompasses everything from the u.s. role in world affairs to trade and most-recently the dispute over the international criminal court .
recalling their own experiences with u.s.-european relations , the signatories – including former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher – complained that the atlantic had grown wider than it ever was before .
europe and the united states should not isolate themselves and work against one another , they wrote .
" the renewal of transatlantic cooperation must be an immediate priority , " the letter stated in its appeal to current eu leaders to drop their anti-american stance and work with their partner across the ocean .
neither the united states nor europe is in a position to be the sole provider of security and economic growth , the leaders stressed .
" no important problem in the world can be solved without the joint engagement of the u.s. and europe ; and no problem is impossible when worked on together , " they said .
u.s. role in european unification the letter , which appears in the run-up to the european union summit in greece later this week , reaffirmed the importance the united states played in the creation of a free europe .
" the existence of a unified europe could not have been possible without the decisive role played by the u.s. , who helped us conquer totalitarianism .
europeans will never forget this and they appreciate the support provided to the union by america , in particular at this key moment in history . "
in light of the upcoming summit , the 17 former leaders admonished the current heads of state that the eu " was not created in opposition to the united states and will work in close collaboration with the u.s. in the future . "
the topic of u.s. – european relations is expected to rank high on the summit ’ s agenda after the question of the first draft for a european constitution , which some politicians hope will eventually lead to a united states of europe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld repeats " old europe " comments at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments -lrb- june 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .

germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .
iceland hopes it will receive permission to hunt up to 500 animals each year for science reasons at the berlin meeting . science or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whale sashimi at a fish market in shimonoseki , japan .
germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers . " the commission started off as a whaling body , but over time it has been moving towards conservation , " richard page of greenpeace told deutsche welle .

the list of signatories reads like a who ’ s who of european politics from the last 20 years : former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , spain 's ex-prime minister felipe gonzalez and two former german chancellors – including kohl – all backed the initiative . the letter , which appeared simultaneously in the french newspaper " le monde " and the italian newspaper " corriere della sera " , stressed the importance of maintaining good ties between europe and the united states .
under the title " never against america , " the former heads of state said it was time to put aside the differences which arose in the wake of the u.s.-led war on iraq .
transatlantic cooperation since the war in iraq , " the unity of the western world has been openly questioned , " the former leaders lamented and criticized the damaging tone of the current transatlantic debate which encompasses everything from the u.s. role in world affairs to trade and most-recently the dispute over the international criminal court .
recalling their own experiences with u.s.-european relations , the signatories – including former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher – complained that the atlantic had grown wider than it ever was before .
europe and the united states should not isolate themselves and work against one another , they wrote .
" the renewal of transatlantic cooperation must be an immediate priority , " the letter stated in its appeal to current eu leaders to drop their anti-american stance and work with their partner across the ocean .
neither the united states nor europe is in a position to be the sole provider of security and economic growth , the leaders stressed .
" no important problem in the world can be solved without the joint engagement of the u.s. and europe ; and no problem is impossible when worked on together , " they said .
u.s. role in european unification the letter , which appears in the run-up to the european union summit in greece later this week , reaffirmed the importance the united states played in the creation of a free europe .
" the existence of a unified europe could not have been possible without the decisive role played by the u.s. , who helped us conquer totalitarianism .
europeans will never forget this and they appreciate the support provided to the union by america , in particular at this key moment in history . "
in light of the upcoming summit , the 17 former leaders admonished the current heads of state that the eu " was not created in opposition to the united states and will work in close collaboration with the u.s. in the future . "
the topic of u.s. – european relations is expected to rank high on the summit ’ s agenda after the question of the first draft for a european constitution , which some politicians hope will eventually lead to a united states of europe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld repeats " old europe " comments at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments -lrb- june 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a340-600 .
there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a340-600 .
there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .

the pentagon has banned the traditional aerial displays by its military pilots in what is widely seen as a deliberate snub to the french with only 6 planes from the united states making an appearance on the ground at le bourget .
relations between the countries have been at an all-time low since the u.s.-led war in iraq , a military invasion france condemned .
to make matters worse between the two nations , french defence minister michele alliot-marie announced on saturday in the french newspaper le monde that she had asked for " a study of the risks " that u.s. investments could represent in companies linked to european defense .
in her interview , timed to coincide with the the air show , alliot-marie urged european firms to stand together to resist what she called the united states ’ " true preoccupation " to take over european defense concerns .
" american industrialists are pursuing a logic of economic war , " she said .
" the french defense minister is entitled to her own opinion , " said u.s. defense department spokesperson jim turner in response .
" however , her opinion does not accurately characterize the policy or position of the secretary of defense , or the position of the u.s. government .

the list of signatories reads like a who ’ s who of european politics from the last 20 years : former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , spain 's ex-prime minister felipe gonzalez and two former german chancellors – including kohl – all backed the initiative . the letter , which appeared simultaneously in the french newspaper " le monde " and the italian newspaper " corriere della sera " , stressed the importance of maintaining good ties between europe and the united states .
under the title " never against america , " the former heads of state said it was time to put aside the differences which arose in the wake of the u.s.-led war on iraq .
transatlantic cooperation since the war in iraq , " the unity of the western world has been openly questioned , " the former leaders lamented and criticized the damaging tone of the current transatlantic debate which encompasses everything from the u.s. role in world affairs to trade and most-recently the dispute over the international criminal court .
recalling their own experiences with u.s.-european relations , the signatories – including former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher – complained that the atlantic had grown wider than it ever was before .
europe and the united states should not isolate themselves and work against one another , they wrote .
" the renewal of transatlantic cooperation must be an immediate priority , " the letter stated in its appeal to current eu leaders to drop their anti-american stance and work with their partner across the ocean .
neither the united states nor europe is in a position to be the sole provider of security and economic growth , the leaders stressed .
" no important problem in the world can be solved without the joint engagement of the u.s. and europe ; and no problem is impossible when worked on together , " they said .
u.s. role in european unification the letter , which appears in the run-up to the european union summit in greece later this week , reaffirmed the importance the united states played in the creation of a free europe .
" the existence of a unified europe could not have been possible without the decisive role played by the u.s. , who helped us conquer totalitarianism .
europeans will never forget this and they appreciate the support provided to the union by america , in particular at this key moment in history . "
in light of the upcoming summit , the 17 former leaders admonished the current heads of state that the eu " was not created in opposition to the united states and will work in close collaboration with the u.s. in the future . "
the topic of u.s. – european relations is expected to rank high on the summit ’ s agenda after the question of the first draft for a european constitution , which some politicians hope will eventually lead to a united states of europe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld repeats " old europe " comments at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments -lrb- june 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .
the most often cited possibilities for a first major case are war crimes in the republic of congo , sierra leone and colombia , but few believe any case will be accepted before 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wrangles over international court highlight transatlantic rift the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court .

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .
the most often cited possibilities for a first major case are war crimes in the republic of congo , sierra leone and colombia , but few believe any case will be accepted before 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wrangles over international court highlight transatlantic rift the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .
iceland hopes it will receive permission to hunt up to 500 animals each year for science reasons at the berlin meeting . science or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whale sashimi at a fish market in shimonoseki , japan .
germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers . " the commission started off as a whaling body , but over time it has been moving towards conservation , " richard page of greenpeace told deutsche welle .

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .
iceland hopes it will receive permission to hunt up to 500 animals each year for science reasons at the berlin meeting . science or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whale sashimi at a fish market in shimonoseki , japan .
germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers . " the commission started off as a whaling body , but over time it has been moving towards conservation , " richard page of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" a lot depends on how the -lsb- new members -rsb- vote at this meeting .
we 're worried that these countries have actually been recruited to the pro-whaling side by the fisheries agency of japan , which has been using fisheries grant aid to buy the votes of developing countries in the commission , " he said . greenpeace claims that over 300,000 whales , dolphins and porpoises die as a result of human activities each year .

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .

though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .

the list of signatories reads like a who ’ s who of european politics from the last 20 years : former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , spain 's ex-prime minister felipe gonzalez and two former german chancellors – including kohl – all backed the initiative . the letter , which appeared simultaneously in the french newspaper " le monde " and the italian newspaper " corriere della sera " , stressed the importance of maintaining good ties between europe and the united states .
under the title " never against america , " the former heads of state said it was time to put aside the differences which arose in the wake of the u.s.-led war on iraq .
transatlantic cooperation since the war in iraq , " the unity of the western world has been openly questioned , " the former leaders lamented and criticized the damaging tone of the current transatlantic debate which encompasses everything from the u.s. role in world affairs to trade and most-recently the dispute over the international criminal court .

europe and the united states should not isolate themselves and work against one another , they wrote .
" the renewal of transatlantic cooperation must be an immediate priority , " the letter stated in its appeal to current eu leaders to drop their anti-american stance and work with their partner across the ocean .
neither the united states nor europe is in a position to be the sole provider of security and economic growth , the leaders stressed .

" the existence of a unified europe could not have been possible without the decisive role played by the u.s. , who helped us conquer totalitarianism .
europeans will never forget this and they appreciate the support provided to the union by america , in particular at this key moment in history . "
in light of the upcoming summit , the 17 former leaders admonished the current heads of state that the eu " was not created in opposition to the united states and will work in close collaboration with the u.s. in the future . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.06.2003 paris air show highlights transatlantic tug of war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tough sell in difficult times : the crowds are coming to the paris air show , but who 's buying ?
the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a340-600 .
there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .
u.s. presence scaled back amid rows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acrobatics ... but not from the americans .
boeing ’ s sedated foray into the expected rivallry at the event was indicative of the scaled down american presence at the 45th paris air show .
u.s. participation this year has been sharply reduced and , for the first time , no u.s. military plane will perform in the sky .
the pentagon has banned the traditional aerial displays by its military pilots in what is widely seen as a deliberate snub to the french with only 6 planes from the united states making an appearance on the ground at le bourget .
relations between the countries have been at an all-time low since the u.s.-led war in iraq , a military invasion france condemned .
to make matters worse between the two nations , french defence minister michele alliot-marie announced on saturday in the french newspaper le monde that she had asked for " a study of the risks " that u.s. investments could represent in companies linked to european defense .
in her interview , timed to coincide with the the air show , alliot-marie urged european firms to stand together to resist what she called the united states ’ " true preoccupation " to take over european defense concerns .
" american industrialists are pursuing a logic of economic war , " she said .
" the french defense minister is entitled to her own opinion , " said u.s. defense department spokesperson jim turner in response .
" however , her opinion does not accurately characterize the policy or position of the secretary of defense , or the position of the u.s. government .

there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.06.2003 chief prosecutor joins war crimes court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno ocampo will have to take down despots and opposition from washington for the international criminal court to succeed .
as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .
iceland hopes it will receive permission to hunt up to 500 animals each year for science reasons at the berlin meeting . science or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whale sashimi at a fish market in shimonoseki , japan .
germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers . " the commission started off as a whaling body , but over time it has been moving towards conservation , " richard page of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" a lot depends on how the -lsb- new members -rsb- vote at this meeting .
we 're worried that these countries have actually been recruited to the pro-whaling side by the fisheries agency of japan , which has been using fisheries grant aid to buy the votes of developing countries in the commission , " he said . greenpeace claims that over 300,000 whales , dolphins and porpoises die as a result of human activities each year .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .

" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .

there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.06.2003 former european leaders call for improved transatlantic ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president bush and french president jacques chirac do n't always see eye-to-eye on transatlantic issues in an open letter published in " le monde " and " corriere della sera , " 17 former european leaders , including ex-german chancellor helmut kohl , called on current leaders to renew the transatlantic partnership with the u.s. seventeen ex-leaders from across the european union wrote an open letter this weekend to the current leaders of europe calling for a rapid improvement in transatlantic relations .
the list of signatories reads like a who ’ s who of european politics from the last 20 years : former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , spain 's ex-prime minister felipe gonzalez and two former german chancellors – including kohl – all backed the initiative . the letter , which appeared simultaneously in the french newspaper " le monde " and the italian newspaper " corriere della sera " , stressed the importance of maintaining good ties between europe and the united states .
under the title " never against america , " the former heads of state said it was time to put aside the differences which arose in the wake of the u.s.-led war on iraq .
transatlantic cooperation since the war in iraq , " the unity of the western world has been openly questioned , " the former leaders lamented and criticized the damaging tone of the current transatlantic debate which encompasses everything from the u.s. role in world affairs to trade and most-recently the dispute over the international criminal court .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .
iceland hopes it will receive permission to hunt up to 500 animals each year for science reasons at the berlin meeting . science or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whale sashimi at a fish market in shimonoseki , japan .
germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers . " the commission started off as a whaling body , but over time it has been moving towards conservation , " richard page of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" a lot depends on how the -lsb- new members -rsb- vote at this meeting .
we 're worried that these countries have actually been recruited to the pro-whaling side by the fisheries agency of japan , which has been using fisheries grant aid to buy the votes of developing countries in the commission , " he said . greenpeace claims that over 300,000 whales , dolphins and porpoises die as a result of human activities each year .
to highlight the organization 's campaign , greenpeace attached a 15-meter inflatable whale to berlin 's fernsehturm , the city 's landmark tv tower , on sunday -lrb- photo above -rrb- with a banner reading " iwc act now .

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .
the most often cited possibilities for a first major case are war crimes in the republic of congo , sierra leone and colombia , but few believe any case will be accepted before 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wrangles over international court highlight transatlantic rift the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court .

the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .
the most often cited possibilities for a first major case are war crimes in the republic of congo , sierra leone and colombia , but few believe any case will be accepted before 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wrangles over international court highlight transatlantic rift the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .

germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers . " the commission started off as a whaling body , but over time it has been moving towards conservation , " richard page of greenpeace told deutsche welle .

the list of signatories reads like a who ’ s who of european politics from the last 20 years : former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , spain 's ex-prime minister felipe gonzalez and two former german chancellors – including kohl – all backed the initiative . the letter , which appeared simultaneously in the french newspaper " le monde " and the italian newspaper " corriere della sera " , stressed the importance of maintaining good ties between europe and the united states .
under the title " never against america , " the former heads of state said it was time to put aside the differences which arose in the wake of the u.s.-led war on iraq .
transatlantic cooperation since the war in iraq , " the unity of the western world has been openly questioned , " the former leaders lamented and criticized the damaging tone of the current transatlantic debate which encompasses everything from the u.s. role in world affairs to trade and most-recently the dispute over the international criminal court .
recalling their own experiences with u.s.-european relations , the signatories – including former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher – complained that the atlantic had grown wider than it ever was before .
europe and the united states should not isolate themselves and work against one another , they wrote .
" the renewal of transatlantic cooperation must be an immediate priority , " the letter stated in its appeal to current eu leaders to drop their anti-american stance and work with their partner across the ocean .
neither the united states nor europe is in a position to be the sole provider of security and economic growth , the leaders stressed .
" no important problem in the world can be solved without the joint engagement of the u.s. and europe ; and no problem is impossible when worked on together , " they said .
u.s. role in european unification the letter , which appears in the run-up to the european union summit in greece later this week , reaffirmed the importance the united states played in the creation of a free europe .
" the existence of a unified europe could not have been possible without the decisive role played by the u.s. , who helped us conquer totalitarianism .
europeans will never forget this and they appreciate the support provided to the union by america , in particular at this key moment in history . "
in light of the upcoming summit , the 17 former leaders admonished the current heads of state that the eu " was not created in opposition to the united states and will work in close collaboration with the u.s. in the future . "
the topic of u.s. – european relations is expected to rank high on the summit ’ s agenda after the question of the first draft for a european constitution , which some politicians hope will eventually lead to a united states of europe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld repeats " old europe " comments at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments -lrb- june 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a340-600 .
there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .
u.s. presence scaled back amid rows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acrobatics ... but not from the americans .
boeing ’ s sedated foray into the expected rivallry at the event was indicative of the scaled down american presence at the 45th paris air show .
u.s. participation this year has been sharply reduced and , for the first time , no u.s. military plane will perform in the sky .
the pentagon has banned the traditional aerial displays by its military pilots in what is widely seen as a deliberate snub to the french with only 6 planes from the united states making an appearance on the ground at le bourget .
relations between the countries have been at an all-time low since the u.s.-led war in iraq , a military invasion france condemned .
to make matters worse between the two nations , french defence minister michele alliot-marie announced on saturday in the french newspaper le monde that she had asked for " a study of the risks " that u.s. investments could represent in companies linked to european defense .
in her interview , timed to coincide with the the air show , alliot-marie urged european firms to stand together to resist what she called the united states ’ " true preoccupation " to take over european defense concerns .
" american industrialists are pursuing a logic of economic war , " she said .
" the french defense minister is entitled to her own opinion , " said u.s. defense department spokesperson jim turner in response .
" however , her opinion does not accurately characterize the policy or position of the secretary of defense , or the position of the u.s. government .

the list of signatories reads like a who ’ s who of european politics from the last 20 years : former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , spain 's ex-prime minister felipe gonzalez and two former german chancellors – including kohl – all backed the initiative . the letter , which appeared simultaneously in the french newspaper " le monde " and the italian newspaper " corriere della sera " , stressed the importance of maintaining good ties between europe and the united states .

transatlantic cooperation since the war in iraq , " the unity of the western world has been openly questioned , " the former leaders lamented and criticized the damaging tone of the current transatlantic debate which encompasses everything from the u.s. role in world affairs to trade and most-recently the dispute over the international criminal court .
recalling their own experiences with u.s.-european relations , the signatories – including former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher – complained that the atlantic had grown wider than it ever was before .
europe and the united states should not isolate themselves and work against one another , they wrote .
" the renewal of transatlantic cooperation must be an immediate priority , " the letter stated in its appeal to current eu leaders to drop their anti-american stance and work with their partner across the ocean .
neither the united states nor europe is in a position to be the sole provider of security and economic growth , the leaders stressed .
" no important problem in the world can be solved without the joint engagement of the u.s. and europe ; and no problem is impossible when worked on together , " they said .

europeans will never forget this and they appreciate the support provided to the union by america , in particular at this key moment in history . "

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .
iceland hopes it will receive permission to hunt up to 500 animals each year for science reasons at the berlin meeting . science or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whale sashimi at a fish market in shimonoseki , japan .
germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers . " the commission started off as a whaling body , but over time it has been moving towards conservation , " richard page of greenpeace told deutsche welle .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a340-600 .
there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .
u.s. presence scaled back amid rows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acrobatics ... but not from the americans .
boeing ’ s sedated foray into the expected rivallry at the event was indicative of the scaled down american presence at the 45th paris air show .
u.s. participation this year has been sharply reduced and , for the first time , no u.s. military plane will perform in the sky .
the pentagon has banned the traditional aerial displays by its military pilots in what is widely seen as a deliberate snub to the french with only 6 planes from the united states making an appearance on the ground at le bourget .
relations between the countries have been at an all-time low since the u.s.-led war in iraq , a military invasion france condemned .
to make matters worse between the two nations , french defence minister michele alliot-marie announced on saturday in the french newspaper le monde that she had asked for " a study of the risks " that u.s. investments could represent in companies linked to european defense .
in her interview , timed to coincide with the the air show , alliot-marie urged european firms to stand together to resist what she called the united states ’ " true preoccupation " to take over european defense concerns .
" american industrialists are pursuing a logic of economic war , " she said .
" the french defense minister is entitled to her own opinion , " said u.s. defense department spokesperson jim turner in response .
" however , her opinion does not accurately characterize the policy or position of the secretary of defense , or the position of the u.s. government .

the list of signatories reads like a who ’ s who of european politics from the last 20 years : former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , spain 's ex-prime minister felipe gonzalez and two former german chancellors – including kohl – all backed the initiative . the letter , which appeared simultaneously in the french newspaper " le monde " and the italian newspaper " corriere della sera " , stressed the importance of maintaining good ties between europe and the united states .
under the title " never against america , " the former heads of state said it was time to put aside the differences which arose in the wake of the u.s.-led war on iraq .
transatlantic cooperation since the war in iraq , " the unity of the western world has been openly questioned , " the former leaders lamented and criticized the damaging tone of the current transatlantic debate which encompasses everything from the u.s. role in world affairs to trade and most-recently the dispute over the international criminal court .
recalling their own experiences with u.s.-european relations , the signatories – including former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher – complained that the atlantic had grown wider than it ever was before .
europe and the united states should not isolate themselves and work against one another , they wrote .
" the renewal of transatlantic cooperation must be an immediate priority , " the letter stated in its appeal to current eu leaders to drop their anti-american stance and work with their partner across the ocean .
neither the united states nor europe is in a position to be the sole provider of security and economic growth , the leaders stressed .
" no important problem in the world can be solved without the joint engagement of the u.s. and europe ; and no problem is impossible when worked on together , " they said .
u.s. role in european unification the letter , which appears in the run-up to the european union summit in greece later this week , reaffirmed the importance the united states played in the creation of a free europe .
" the existence of a unified europe could not have been possible without the decisive role played by the u.s. , who helped us conquer totalitarianism .
europeans will never forget this and they appreciate the support provided to the union by america , in particular at this key moment in history . "
in light of the upcoming summit , the 17 former leaders admonished the current heads of state that the eu " was not created in opposition to the united states and will work in close collaboration with the u.s. in the future . "
the topic of u.s. – european relations is expected to rank high on the summit ’ s agenda after the question of the first draft for a european constitution , which some politicians hope will eventually lead to a united states of europe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld repeats " old europe " comments at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments -lrb- june 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a340-600 .
there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .
u.s. presence scaled back amid rows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acrobatics ... but not from the americans .
boeing ’ s sedated foray into the expected rivallry at the event was indicative of the scaled down american presence at the 45th paris air show .
u.s. participation this year has been sharply reduced and , for the first time , no u.s. military plane will perform in the sky .
the pentagon has banned the traditional aerial displays by its military pilots in what is widely seen as a deliberate snub to the french with only 6 planes from the united states making an appearance on the ground at le bourget .
relations between the countries have been at an all-time low since the u.s.-led war in iraq , a military invasion france condemned .
to make matters worse between the two nations , french defence minister michele alliot-marie announced on saturday in the french newspaper le monde that she had asked for " a study of the risks " that u.s. investments could represent in companies linked to european defense .
in her interview , timed to coincide with the the air show , alliot-marie urged european firms to stand together to resist what she called the united states ’ " true preoccupation " to take over european defense concerns .
" american industrialists are pursuing a logic of economic war , " she said .
" the french defense minister is entitled to her own opinion , " said u.s. defense department spokesperson jim turner in response .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .
iceland hopes it will receive permission to hunt up to 500 animals each year for science reasons at the berlin meeting . science or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whale sashimi at a fish market in shimonoseki , japan .
germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers . " the commission started off as a whaling body , but over time it has been moving towards conservation , " richard page of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" a lot depends on how the -lsb- new members -rsb- vote at this meeting .
we 're worried that these countries have actually been recruited to the pro-whaling side by the fisheries agency of japan , which has been using fisheries grant aid to buy the votes of developing countries in the commission , " he said . greenpeace claims that over 300,000 whales , dolphins and porpoises die as a result of human activities each year .
to highlight the organization 's campaign , greenpeace attached a 15-meter inflatable whale to berlin 's fernsehturm , the city 's landmark tv tower , on sunday -lrb- photo above -rrb- with a banner reading " iwc act now .

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .
the most often cited possibilities for a first major case are war crimes in the republic of congo , sierra leone and colombia , but few believe any case will be accepted before 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wrangles over international court highlight transatlantic rift the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court .

his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .
the most often cited possibilities for a first major case are war crimes in the republic of congo , sierra leone and colombia , but few believe any case will be accepted before 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wrangles over international court highlight transatlantic rift the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .
iceland hopes it will receive permission to hunt up to 500 animals each year for science reasons at the berlin meeting . science or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whale sashimi at a fish market in shimonoseki , japan .
germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers . " the commission started off as a whaling body , but over time it has been moving towards conservation , " richard page of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" a lot depends on how the -lsb- new members -rsb- vote at this meeting .
we 're worried that these countries have actually been recruited to the pro-whaling side by the fisheries agency of japan , which has been using fisheries grant aid to buy the votes of developing countries in the commission , " he said . greenpeace claims that over 300,000 whales , dolphins and porpoises die as a result of human activities each year .
to highlight the organization 's campaign , greenpeace attached a 15-meter inflatable whale to berlin 's fernsehturm , the city 's landmark tv tower , on sunday -lrb- photo above -rrb- with a banner reading " iwc act now .

the list of signatories reads like a who ’ s who of european politics from the last 20 years : former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , spain 's ex-prime minister felipe gonzalez and two former german chancellors – including kohl – all backed the initiative . the letter , which appeared simultaneously in the french newspaper " le monde " and the italian newspaper " corriere della sera " , stressed the importance of maintaining good ties between europe and the united states .
under the title " never against america , " the former heads of state said it was time to put aside the differences which arose in the wake of the u.s.-led war on iraq .
transatlantic cooperation since the war in iraq , " the unity of the western world has been openly questioned , " the former leaders lamented and criticized the damaging tone of the current transatlantic debate which encompasses everything from the u.s. role in world affairs to trade and most-recently the dispute over the international criminal court .
recalling their own experiences with u.s.-european relations , the signatories – including former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher – complained that the atlantic had grown wider than it ever was before .
europe and the united states should not isolate themselves and work against one another , they wrote .
" the renewal of transatlantic cooperation must be an immediate priority , " the letter stated in its appeal to current eu leaders to drop their anti-american stance and work with their partner across the ocean .
neither the united states nor europe is in a position to be the sole provider of security and economic growth , the leaders stressed .
" no important problem in the world can be solved without the joint engagement of the u.s. and europe ; and no problem is impossible when worked on together , " they said .
u.s. role in european unification the letter , which appears in the run-up to the european union summit in greece later this week , reaffirmed the importance the united states played in the creation of a free europe .
" the existence of a unified europe could not have been possible without the decisive role played by the u.s. , who helped us conquer totalitarianism .
europeans will never forget this and they appreciate the support provided to the union by america , in particular at this key moment in history . "
in light of the upcoming summit , the 17 former leaders admonished the current heads of state that the eu " was not created in opposition to the united states and will work in close collaboration with the u.s. in the future . "

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .
the most often cited possibilities for a first major case are war crimes in the republic of congo , sierra leone and colombia , but few believe any case will be accepted before 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wrangles over international court highlight transatlantic rift the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a340-600 .
there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .
u.s. presence scaled back amid rows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acrobatics ... but not from the americans .
boeing ’ s sedated foray into the expected rivallry at the event was indicative of the scaled down american presence at the 45th paris air show .
u.s. participation this year has been sharply reduced and , for the first time , no u.s. military plane will perform in the sky .
the pentagon has banned the traditional aerial displays by its military pilots in what is widely seen as a deliberate snub to the french with only 6 planes from the united states making an appearance on the ground at le bourget .
relations between the countries have been at an all-time low since the u.s.-led war in iraq , a military invasion france condemned .
to make matters worse between the two nations , french defence minister michele alliot-marie announced on saturday in the french newspaper le monde that she had asked for " a study of the risks " that u.s. investments could represent in companies linked to european defense .
in her interview , timed to coincide with the the air show , alliot-marie urged european firms to stand together to resist what she called the united states ’ " true preoccupation " to take over european defense concerns .
" american industrialists are pursuing a logic of economic war , " she said .
" the french defense minister is entitled to her own opinion , " said u.s. defense department spokesperson jim turner in response .
" however , her opinion does not accurately characterize the policy or position of the secretary of defense , or the position of the u.s. government .

airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a340-600 .
there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .
u.s. presence scaled back amid rows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acrobatics ... but not from the americans .
boeing ’ s sedated foray into the expected rivallry at the event was indicative of the scaled down american presence at the 45th paris air show .
u.s. participation this year has been sharply reduced and , for the first time , no u.s. military plane will perform in the sky .
the pentagon has banned the traditional aerial displays by its military pilots in what is widely seen as a deliberate snub to the french with only 6 planes from the united states making an appearance on the ground at le bourget .
relations between the countries have been at an all-time low since the u.s.-led war in iraq , a military invasion france condemned .
to make matters worse between the two nations , french defence minister michele alliot-marie announced on saturday in the french newspaper le monde that she had asked for " a study of the risks " that u.s. investments could represent in companies linked to european defense .
in her interview , timed to coincide with the the air show , alliot-marie urged european firms to stand together to resist what she called the united states ’ " true preoccupation " to take over european defense concerns .
" american industrialists are pursuing a logic of economic war , " she said .
" the french defense minister is entitled to her own opinion , " said u.s. defense department spokesperson jim turner in response .
" however , her opinion does not accurately characterize the policy or position of the secretary of defense , or the position of the u.s. government .

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.06.2003 international whaling commission meeting moves to protect whales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace hung a plastic whale from berlin 's tv tower to protest against whaling on sunday .
the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .
the most often cited possibilities for a first major case are war crimes in the republic of congo , sierra leone and colombia , but few believe any case will be accepted before 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wrangles over international court highlight transatlantic rift the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a340-600 .
there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .
u.s. presence scaled back amid rows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acrobatics ... but not from the americans .
boeing ’ s sedated foray into the expected rivallry at the event was indicative of the scaled down american presence at the 45th paris air show .
u.s. participation this year has been sharply reduced and , for the first time , no u.s. military plane will perform in the sky .
the pentagon has banned the traditional aerial displays by its military pilots in what is widely seen as a deliberate snub to the french with only 6 planes from the united states making an appearance on the ground at le bourget .
relations between the countries have been at an all-time low since the u.s.-led war in iraq , a military invasion france condemned .
to make matters worse between the two nations , french defence minister michele alliot-marie announced on saturday in the french newspaper le monde that she had asked for " a study of the risks " that u.s. investments could represent in companies linked to european defense .
in her interview , timed to coincide with the the air show , alliot-marie urged european firms to stand together to resist what she called the united states ’ " true preoccupation " to take over european defense concerns .
" american industrialists are pursuing a logic of economic war , " she said .
" the french defense minister is entitled to her own opinion , " said u.s. defense department spokesperson jim turner in response .
" however , her opinion does not accurately characterize the policy or position of the secretary of defense , or the position of the u.s. government .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .

germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.06.2003 chief prosecutor joins war crimes court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno ocampo will have to take down despots and opposition from washington for the international criminal court to succeed .
as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.06.2003 chief prosecutor joins war crimes court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luis moreno ocampo will have to take down despots and opposition from washington for the international criminal court to succeed .
as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .
iceland hopes it will receive permission to hunt up to 500 animals each year for science reasons at the berlin meeting . science or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whale sashimi at a fish market in shimonoseki , japan .
germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers . " the commission started off as a whaling body , but over time it has been moving towards conservation , " richard page of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" a lot depends on how the -lsb- new members -rsb- vote at this meeting .
we 're worried that these countries have actually been recruited to the pro-whaling side by the fisheries agency of japan , which has been using fisheries grant aid to buy the votes of developing countries in the commission , " he said . greenpeace claims that over 300,000 whales , dolphins and porpoises die as a result of human activities each year .

the list of signatories reads like a who ’ s who of european politics from the last 20 years : former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , spain 's ex-prime minister felipe gonzalez and two former german chancellors – including kohl – all backed the initiative . the letter , which appeared simultaneously in the french newspaper " le monde " and the italian newspaper " corriere della sera " , stressed the importance of maintaining good ties between europe and the united states .
under the title " never against america , " the former heads of state said it was time to put aside the differences which arose in the wake of the u.s.-led war on iraq .
transatlantic cooperation since the war in iraq , " the unity of the western world has been openly questioned , " the former leaders lamented and criticized the damaging tone of the current transatlantic debate which encompasses everything from the u.s. role in world affairs to trade and most-recently the dispute over the international criminal court .
recalling their own experiences with u.s.-european relations , the signatories – including former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher – complained that the atlantic had grown wider than it ever was before .
europe and the united states should not isolate themselves and work against one another , they wrote .
" the renewal of transatlantic cooperation must be an immediate priority , " the letter stated in its appeal to current eu leaders to drop their anti-american stance and work with their partner across the ocean .
neither the united states nor europe is in a position to be the sole provider of security and economic growth , the leaders stressed .
" no important problem in the world can be solved without the joint engagement of the u.s. and europe ; and no problem is impossible when worked on together , " they said .
u.s. role in european unification the letter , which appears in the run-up to the european union summit in greece later this week , reaffirmed the importance the united states played in the creation of a free europe .
" the existence of a unified europe could not have been possible without the decisive role played by the u.s. , who helped us conquer totalitarianism .
europeans will never forget this and they appreciate the support provided to the union by america , in particular at this key moment in history . "
in light of the upcoming summit , the 17 former leaders admonished the current heads of state that the eu " was not created in opposition to the united states and will work in close collaboration with the u.s. in the future . "
the topic of u.s. – european relations is expected to rank high on the summit ’ s agenda after the question of the first draft for a european constitution , which some politicians hope will eventually lead to a united states of europe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld repeats " old europe " comments at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments -lrb- june 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .
the most often cited possibilities for a first major case are war crimes in the republic of congo , sierra leone and colombia , but few believe any case will be accepted before 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wrangles over international court highlight transatlantic rift the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court .

but along with iraq and china , the united states is n't a party to the tribunal which intends to prosecute crimes against humanity throughout the world .

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .
the most often cited possibilities for a first major case are war crimes in the republic of congo , sierra leone and colombia , but few believe any case will be accepted before 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wrangles over international court highlight transatlantic rift the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a340-600 .
there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .
camus added that the airline , the fastest-growing in the region , would also announce orders for its a340-500s and a340-600s jets , though did n't provide details .
new a380 on schedule the company also added that it remains on track for delivering the first of its 550-seat double-decker a380s by the first half of 2006 , with the aircraft entering service first with singapore airlines ltd .
the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .
u.s. presence scaled back amid rows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : acrobatics ... but not from the americans .
boeing ’ s sedated foray into the expected rivallry at the event was indicative of the scaled down american presence at the 45th paris air show .
u.s. participation this year has been sharply reduced and , for the first time , no u.s. military plane will perform in the sky .
the pentagon has banned the traditional aerial displays by its military pilots in what is widely seen as a deliberate snub to the french with only 6 planes from the united states making an appearance on the ground at le bourget .
relations between the countries have been at an all-time low since the u.s.-led war in iraq , a military invasion france condemned .
to make matters worse between the two nations , french defence minister michele alliot-marie announced on saturday in the french newspaper le monde that she had asked for " a study of the risks " that u.s. investments could represent in companies linked to european defense .
in her interview , timed to coincide with the the air show , alliot-marie urged european firms to stand together to resist what she called the united states ’ " true preoccupation " to take over european defense concerns .
" american industrialists are pursuing a logic of economic war , " she said .
" the french defense minister is entitled to her own opinion , " said u.s. defense department spokesperson jim turner in response .

the list of signatories reads like a who ’ s who of european politics from the last 20 years : former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , spain 's ex-prime minister felipe gonzalez and two former german chancellors – including kohl – all backed the initiative . the letter , which appeared simultaneously in the french newspaper " le monde " and the italian newspaper " corriere della sera " , stressed the importance of maintaining good ties between europe and the united states .
under the title " never against america , " the former heads of state said it was time to put aside the differences which arose in the wake of the u.s.-led war on iraq .
transatlantic cooperation since the war in iraq , " the unity of the western world has been openly questioned , " the former leaders lamented and criticized the damaging tone of the current transatlantic debate which encompasses everything from the u.s. role in world affairs to trade and most-recently the dispute over the international criminal court .
recalling their own experiences with u.s.-european relations , the signatories – including former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher – complained that the atlantic had grown wider than it ever was before .
europe and the united states should not isolate themselves and work against one another , they wrote .
" the renewal of transatlantic cooperation must be an immediate priority , " the letter stated in its appeal to current eu leaders to drop their anti-american stance and work with their partner across the ocean .
neither the united states nor europe is in a position to be the sole provider of security and economic growth , the leaders stressed .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .
iceland hopes it will receive permission to hunt up to 500 animals each year for science reasons at the berlin meeting . science or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whale sashimi at a fish market in shimonoseki , japan .
germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers . " the commission started off as a whaling body , but over time it has been moving towards conservation , " richard page of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" a lot depends on how the -lsb- new members -rsb- vote at this meeting .
we 're worried that these countries have actually been recruited to the pro-whaling side by the fisheries agency of japan , which has been using fisheries grant aid to buy the votes of developing countries in the commission , " he said . greenpeace claims that over 300,000 whales , dolphins and porpoises die as a result of human activities each year .
to highlight the organization 's campaign , greenpeace attached a 15-meter inflatable whale to berlin 's fernsehturm , the city 's landmark tv tower , on sunday -lrb- photo above -rrb- with a banner reading " iwc act now .

as one of argentina 's top prosecutors , luis moreno ocampo fought military dictators and corrupt officials .
on monday , he began battling despots and ruthless killers as the world 's chief prosecutor . during the mid-1980s , luis moreno ocampo served as one of the attorneys who prosecuted the military junta of jorge videlas .
by doing so , he helped draw a close to a painful chapter in argentinian history - a time marked by a corrupt government that ordered the killing and torture of thousands of political dissidents between 1980-84 . united nations officials believe ocampo can be an equally successful prosecutor of today 's tyrants - leaders like former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic or the chieftans of the hema and lendu tribes , who have killed scores of innocents in their ethnic fighting in congo . this week , ocampo will fill his latest legal role - that of the world 's chief prosecutor .
on monday , officials at the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- in the hague swore in ocampo , who will now lead the united nations court that prosecutes cases of war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
though the united states is refusing to participate and even successfully demanded a u.n. resolution immunizing american soldiers from icc prosecution , the court will effectively begin its work this week . for ocampo , it 's a feather in the cap in a long and colorful legal career . fighting corruption and tying history 's loose ends ocampo was only 33 when he served as assistant to the chief federal prosecutor in the videlas trials .
his work , which represented the first prosecution of any military junta in latin america , led to a meteoric rise for videlas on the international stage . ocampo did not stop at prosecuting videlas ' willing helpers - he also went after putschists , generals and corrupt police .
his work garnered accolade after accolade , and he gained the reputation of being a brilliant analyst and uncorruptible lawyer . during the early 1990s , he retired from public service to open his own law firm with a partner .
he took on star clients and star cases , like soccer legend diego maradona and , later , italian holocaust victims who sued the argentine government for the extradition of nazi officer erich priebke .
in 2001 , ocampo won the case and secured priebke 's deportation . down to earth the father of four is respected for his down-to-earth style - and observers say he lacks any semblance of arrogance or conceit .
in argentina , he even starred as a judge on his own law and order television show . later , he became a tele-prosecutor , hunting down corrupt politicians and businessmen in a legal twist on " cops " and " candid camera . "
ocampo would expose the offenders as they were committing a crime or deception on camera .
though the show might sound rather sensational , it actually helped solidify his reputation as a law man .
he has also repeatedly defended his television work , saying that unconventional measures are permissible if they help uncover the truth .
his legions of fans , at home and at the u.n. , apparently agree . now at age 50 , ocampo is considered an international expert on corruption and human rights , and his services as a consultant are in demand from national governments , the united nations and the world bank .
last year , he served as a guest professor at harvard university . given the long string of successes he has chalked up in his career , there was virtually no criticism when his appointment as the icc 's chief prosecutor was unanimously approved in april .
human rights experts from a number of organizations greeted his selection .
as a citizen of a country that is largely perceived as neutral - that is , it is neither a member of nato nor any other military alliance - observers say he could also serve as a bridge builder at the international court . a prosecutor in waiting but it could take months or years before the court lands any spectacular cases .
the icc 's 18 judges officially started work in march , but with the support of only 90 countries , the tribunal has yet to achieve a truly global mandate .
nor does it have a formal headquarters ; it 's literally a garage operation , with makeshift administrative offices located in a renovated parking garage . and , of course , a number of the world 's most influential countries are still refusing to recognize the court , including the united states , china , russia and israel .
the united states went so far as to pressure 37 countries to sign bilateral agreements pledging not to hand u.s. citizens over to the court - a move that has become a major sticking point in transatlantic relations . but the court 's president , phillipe kirsch , is optimistic that that will change down the road .
" the united states is against the court right now , but for me the solution of the problem is just a question of time , " kirsch said .
" in five or ten years , the political conditions will have changed , but the court will still be there . "
in other words , the court may have a better chance at gaining u.s. support after the current administration leaves office . it 's likely that ocampo will prosecute his first case before the u.s. comes on board .
he now has more than 200 possible cases sitting on his desk , but only a fraction of them will make it to court . the icc is only able to prosecute cases involving crimes committed after july 2002 that a country either can not or does not want to try on its own .
the most often cited possibilities for a first major case are war crimes in the republic of congo , sierra leone and colombia , but few believe any case will be accepted before 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wrangles over international court highlight transatlantic rift the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .

there are indications that the european company will consolidate its position as number one with a deal with tui ag , europe 's largest travel company , which is considering the purchase of as many as 60 single-aisle planes .
the company is also in discussion with airtran airways , a low-fare carrier that flies mainly along the u.s. east coast , for an order of at least 50 planes .

the double-decked a380 will become the world 's biggest passenger jet when it begins flying , about 35 percent bigger than the boeing 747 , which seats 420 .
parts of the first aircraft are already in production and airbus plans to begin test flights in early 2005 .
" all that is to say that attempts on the part of some people to say that the a380 is having difficulties is not only pathetic , but in vain , " said foregeard .
airbus has 97 firm orders for the plane and has additional commitments for a total of 103 aircraft .
the company expects to have 125 orders for the a380 .
meanwhile , boeing ’ s announcements on sunday were rather subdued .
the american company expects air traffic to recover to 2000 levels by the end of the year , but when pressed on possible sales , boeing officials declined to forecast new orders for 2003 but hinted that boeing is likely to win an emirates order for 25 777s worth € 4.2 billion at the show .

the list of signatories reads like a who ’ s who of european politics from the last 20 years : former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing , spain 's ex-prime minister felipe gonzalez and two former german chancellors – including kohl – all backed the initiative . the letter , which appeared simultaneously in the french newspaper " le monde " and the italian newspaper " corriere della sera " , stressed the importance of maintaining good ties between europe and the united states .
under the title " never against america , " the former heads of state said it was time to put aside the differences which arose in the wake of the u.s.-led war on iraq .
transatlantic cooperation since the war in iraq , " the unity of the western world has been openly questioned , " the former leaders lamented and criticized the damaging tone of the current transatlantic debate which encompasses everything from the u.s. role in world affairs to trade and most-recently the dispute over the international criminal court .
recalling their own experiences with u.s.-european relations , the signatories – including former german foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher – complained that the atlantic had grown wider than it ever was before .
europe and the united states should not isolate themselves and work against one another , they wrote .
" the renewal of transatlantic cooperation must be an immediate priority , " the letter stated in its appeal to current eu leaders to drop their anti-american stance and work with their partner across the ocean .
neither the united states nor europe is in a position to be the sole provider of security and economic growth , the leaders stressed .
" no important problem in the world can be solved without the joint engagement of the u.s. and europe ; and no problem is impossible when worked on together , " they said .
u.s. role in european unification the letter , which appears in the run-up to the european union summit in greece later this week , reaffirmed the importance the united states played in the creation of a free europe .
" the existence of a unified europe could not have been possible without the decisive role played by the u.s. , who helped us conquer totalitarianism .
europeans will never forget this and they appreciate the support provided to the union by america , in particular at this key moment in history . "
in light of the upcoming summit , the 17 former leaders admonished the current heads of state that the eu " was not created in opposition to the united states and will work in close collaboration with the u.s. in the future . "
the topic of u.s. – european relations is expected to rank high on the summit ’ s agenda after the question of the first draft for a european constitution , which some politicians hope will eventually lead to a united states of europe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld repeats " old europe " comments at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments -lrb- june 11 , 2003 -rrb- .

the world ’ s biggest air show opened this weekend at le bourget airport , near paris , amid economic concerns in the aviation industry and a simmering political row between france and the united states . the 45th paris air show may have opened on saturday under clear blue french skies , but metaphorically there was more than the odd dark cloud hanging over the aviation industry ’ s most prestigious event .
the glorious weather at le bourget airport at the weekend belied the fact that the industry is facing the worst crisis in aviation history and that political power struggles connected to the fallout of the iraq war are doing nothing to help .
as small aircraft rolled in roaring acrobatics overhead , signs that the paris air show would be a manifestation of economic and political turmoil began to make themselves painfully obvious .
exhibit space is down some 5 percent this year from the last show in 2001 , and the number of planes on display has fallen to 206 from 226 .
officials are blaming the current industry climate for the low turn out while the u.s. military 's decision to keep its aircraft and top brass at home - a move widely interpreted as retaliation for french opposition to the war in iraq - has also dampened spirits .
" -lrb- the paris air show -rrb- opens its doors in an atmosphere full of uncertainties and questions , " said dassault aviation chief executive charles edelstenne during the subdued opening rounds of press conferences on saturday , a series of events traditionally full of euphoria .
world crises weigh heavy this year , however , the shadows over the industry and the world caused by the wars in afghanistan and iraq , the sars illness in asia and a slow economy that has cut demand for business and pleasure travel have all combined to give the air show an undercurrent of gloom .
show organizers have acknowledged that the scope of this year 's show pales in comparison with the record-setting 2001 event .
not a single order was announced at the media preview on saturday , usually the forum where boasting executives start the bidding ball rolling .
however , things began to look up at sunday ’ s public opening when u.s. giant boeing and its european rival airbus sas went head to head in an attempt to allay fears of further collapse in the industry .
airbus led the way with executives claiming that it will probably surpass boeing as the world 's largest planemaker this year by delivering more aircraft than its u.s. rival for the first time and beating boeing on orders for new aircraft .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus industrie chairman noel forgeard .
" things are going pretty well for us this year , " ' airbus chief executive officer noel forgeard told reporters .
" the market is a bit better than we 'd expected and our market share is considerably better than we 'd forecast . "
when asked whether he saw signs of a recovery , forgeard said that there " appeared to be signs in the month of may of a traffic rebound .
things are looking a bit better , especially in the u.s. "
airbus orders ahead of estimates estimates show that the france-based planemaker expects to win orders for about 250 planes this year , 40 percent more than it predicted in january , while taking business from its chicago-based rival .
forgeard told reporters that the company expects to deliver 300 planes this year , topping boeing 's 280 .
he had forecast earlier this year that airbus and boeing would win a total of about 350 orders in 2003 , which would be roughly split between the two planemakers .
airbus got orders for 274 planes last year compared with 251 for boeing .
airbus also announced that it has won an order from the middle east-based airline , emirates , for 21 a380 planes and other aircraft in a deal worth more than € 5.48 billion -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- , according to a statement on bloomberg news television by philippe camus , co-chief executive of european aeronautic , defense and space co . , which owns 80 percent of airbus .

the international whaling commission convened for its yearly meeting on monday in berlin .
despite deep divisions between whalers and conservationists , delegates already agreed on measures to help protect whales . tempers were running high at the annual meeting of the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in berlin on monday when japan threatened to walk out of talks .
along with norway , the asian country insisted that new initiatives to protect whales be taken off the agenda of the meeting that runs from june 16 to 20 . still , the iwc 's 50 member countries , which are deeply split between pro- and anti-whaling factions , voted 25 to 20 in favor of a motion to form a conservation panel .
at the fore of the countries that proposed the so-called berlin initiative is germany , formerly a whaling country itself . " people used to be afraid of nature and of supposed sea monsters .
nowadays they are afraid for nature , " german agriculture minister renate künast said in her opening address . she called on whaling nations to develop whale watching as an industry instead of hunting the mammals .
her plea was received with disbelief by norway and criticized by the high north alliance , a group of north atlantic whalers , who said that most whalers live in remote places where such tourism could not be developed . the iwc declared a moratorium on commercially hunting large whales in 1986 .
the animals may only to be killed for scientific purposes or by indigenous peoples in greenland , siberia and alaska .
but norway , which never signed the moratorium and says it therefore does n't have to abide by it , continues to hunt the mammals .
japan officially adheres to the commercial moratorium , but it also kills an unlimited number for research .
iceland hopes it will receive permission to hunt up to 500 animals each year for science reasons at the berlin meeting . science or food ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whale sashimi at a fish market in shimonoseki , japan .
germany 's künast criticized scientific whaling , saying that it is mostly about food . her concern is shared by environmental groups which have said japan 's claims that it hunts whales only for research are untrue . instead they say japan main aim is take advantage of the profitable market in whale blubber .
they have also accused iceland of intending to catch whales to sell on the japanese market rather than for their own research . observers had predicted this year 's meeting would once again pit pro-whaling countries and conservationists against each other without bringing forth any significant results .
but environmental groups are already celebrating . " this is a great success and a historical day for the protection of whales , " world wildlife fund whale specialist volker holmes told afp after the berlin initiative was passed .
the motion has been lauded by conservationists , who believe it addresses many problems that threaten whales , such as becoming entangled in nets , water pollution , climate change and the use of sonar , which they say disorients the cetaceans . earlier in the day , japan had said it would leave the meeting if the berlin initiative won support .
" that is one of the options or we could consider stopping our payments , " delegate masayuki komatsu told reuters . conservation groups had voiced fears on monday that the meeting could tip the scales in favor of the whalers . " the commission started off as a whaling body , but over time it has been moving towards conservation , " richard page of greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" a lot depends on how the -lsb- new members -rsb- vote at this meeting .
we 're worried that these countries have actually been recruited to the pro-whaling side by the fisheries agency of japan , which has been using fisheries grant aid to buy the votes of developing countries in the commission , " he said . greenpeace claims that over 300,000 whales , dolphins and porpoises die as a result of human activities each year .
to highlight the organization 's campaign , greenpeace attached a 15-meter inflatable whale to berlin 's fernsehturm , the city 's landmark tv tower , on sunday -lrb- photo above -rrb- with a banner reading " iwc act now .

sk global , the trading affiliate of one of the country 's largest chaebols sk group , has been on the verge of bankruptcy since a 1.5 trillion won -lrb- $ 1.2bn -rrb- accounting fraud was uncovered in march .
the fate of sk global has been seen as a test of president roh moo-hyun 's drive to reform corporate accountability at the family-run groups , or chaebols , that control most of the economy .
but critics have already said that the bail out is another example of illegal accounting practices in south korea .
and foreign investors had previously been sceptical of a viable and long-lasting bail out .
punished under the rescue deal , sk global will sell sk corp an undisclosed stake in exchange for the dismissal of up to $ 7bn of debt .
the deal will allow sk global to continue its business , and its shares rose by the daily limit of 15 % on the back of the news .
on friday , the chairman of sk corp was sentenced to three years in prison for his part in the accounting fraud .
chey tae-won is the eldest son of the group 's founding family and controls the conglomerate and its 58 subsidiaries , including the country 's leading mobile phone group sk telecom .
nine other sk executives received suspended jail terms .

the county council set it up to try to reduce traffic congestion and parking problems .
traffic congestion is a growing problem in many parts of devon which is not just confined to the main urban areas around plymouth , torbay and exeter .
the situation is made worse by the number of cars with only a driver and no passengers .
i would say to anyone to give it a try , it really does work carol jackson a few months ago the county council set up a database for potential car sharers at the car share web site .
thousands of people have visited the site , and hundreds have already logged on and registered their details to find suitable matches .
the matching service puts people travelling in the same direction or to a similar destination in contact , allowing them to travel together and share costs , as well as reducing congestion and pollution .
' efficient use ' carol sarl and carol jackson from exmouth drive to exeter together and are enthusiastic participants in the scheme .
" you 've got company , one of you gets a day where you can rest and do n't have to drive every day , " said carol jackson .
" i would say to anyone to give it a try , it really does work . "
county councillor david morrish , who has responsibility for the environment , said there were too many single occupancy cars on devon 's roads .
" if we can reduce the number of cars with only the driver inside we can have a much more efficient use of the highway .

that means that a fifth of the £ 1.5bn paid out so far in coal industry compensation has gone to wales .
a total of £ 319m has been delivered so far , according to figures issued by the wales office on monday .
most of it - some £ 229m - has gone towards claims for respiratory diseases such as pneumoconiosis .
another £ 90m is for the condition known as vibration white finger .
the compensation scheme - which came about after british coal was found negligent in relation to lung diseases - is the largest personal injury scheme in british history .
while we are talking of massive figures , there is no room for complacency wales office minister don touhig there has been fierce controversy over the payments , with miners complaining that the process has been slow .
many former pitmen have died before receiving any money .
an estimated 25,000 claims were made by welsh miners , and government ministers had pledged to speed up the process .
wales office minister don touhig welcomed the announcement by the department of trade and industry last week of the total £ 1.5bn payout so far .
miners ' health risks were not always recognised in earlier times the welsh figures included £ 32.6m awarded to welsh claimants between 16 march - 1 june .
some £ 27m has gone to respiratory claimants , and £ 5.6m for vibration white finger .
mr touhig said : " while we are talking of massive figures , there is no room for complacency .
justice " i am determined that no stone should be left unturned until we have secured justice for each and every miner eligible for compensation and their families , " he added .

two other labour mps who represent former mining areas have joined the group : dai havard of merthyr tydfil and rhymney , and huw irranca-davies , of ogmore .
mr touhig said the welsh group provided a crucial element in speeding up the payouts and solving problems .
it includes people from trade unions , lawyers , wales office , welsh assembly and the bodies who handle the claims .
" we have got to make sure that the compensation schemes moves as rapidly as possible and that we continue to target our priorities , the oldest miners , the most ill and the widows , " he said .
" it is not about the money .
it is about the justice of the case - recognition of what the miners went through underground .
" dai havard and huw irranca-davies have been selected by their fellow welsh mps to fill these two vacancies on the sub-group .
" like me , they are mps representing former mining constituencies , and their close and regular contact with former miners , their widows and families will be of great value to the group in its deliberations . "

socialite sir dai llewellyn , who holds the title baronet of bwllfa , plans to sell the home in south wales he calls his " hunting lodge " .
sir dai says he will only return to wales to be buried .
he also wants to sell a row of former miners ' cottages he owns because he claims they have been the target of vandals and thieves .
sir dai , who has lived most of his life in the expensive mayfair area of london , has delivered a series of parting shots against the welsh language , the welsh assembly and what he terms " xenophobic nationalism " .
the welsh language is being used as part of an unhealthy and essentially racist agenda sir dai llewellyn he is the 57-year-old son of the 1952 olympic gold medallist showjumper sir harry llewellyn .
sir harry was born in the south wales valleys town of aberdare .
but sir dai claimed he was not considered " welsh enough " when he returned to the land of his father .
inherited he said the traditional welsh valleys welcome has been replaced by " cold , professional welshmen " .
he inherited the baronet 's title four years ago and bought a home in aberbeeg , blaenau gwent , as well the six cottages in the nearby village of llanhilleth .
sir dai calls this house in aberbeeg his hunting lodge but he said the cottages had been ransacked for baths , toilets , basins , staircases and electrical wiring .
" since then i have suffered arson attacks , threats of violence , a bullet hole through a window , scratches on my mercedes and paint daubing , " he told a newspaper .
" i believe that much of what had happened is prompted by the growth of an increasingly xenophobic nationalism that has been stirred up in wales .
" the most insidious example of this is the promotion of the welsh language which is being used as part of an unhealthy and essentially racist agenda . "
sir dai said the " new-found nationalism " meant wales no longer welcomed outsiders and people like himself were targeted by " thugs and vandals " .
he claimed wales would be better without " bully-boy tactics used to ram the welsh language down her people 's throats " .
sir dai dismissed the welsh assembly as " a joke , a costly talking shop where nothing happens other than discussions on which extensive new building might house the members ' farcical antics . "
" i will come back to wales only to be buried in the churchyard of gobion llanvihangel where i was christened , " he said .
