immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 21.06.2003 eu constitution dominates debate at summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a constitution the eu hopes to function better after enlargement a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

five balkan countries hope to join the union within the next few years : albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro .
all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .
" we expect strong action on reforming state structures to eliminate the widespread curse of corruption " , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
" we expect energetic , totally firm action against organized crime " . saturday 's declaration states organized crime and corruption as the major obstacles for the balkans .
the region , which chris patten , the eu 's commissioner for external affairs , described as " one of the missing pieces in our jigsaw europe " , is europe 's poorest area and is still suffering from years of ethnic war in former yugoslavia . perspective , yes , exact dates , no at the summit , eu leaders stated the importance of encouraging the balkan countries to join the eu .
their future , they said , " is within the european union " . speaking on saturday , the german chancellor emphasized the necessity of giving the balkan states a perspective for membership .
europe 's boundaries were defined a long time ago , schröder said .
" one can not exclude ex-yugoslavia and the balkans from europe " . however , schröder refrained from naming an exact date for enlargement .
the process of democratization and the convergence of economic structures with the eu must be completed before membership could be obtained , schröder said . debate shifts outward the shift to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans comes after friday 's intense debate on the new draft european constitution . greece , which currently holds the rotating presidency , has been keen to make the union focus on the balkans – which lie between greece and most of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders believe that integrating the balkan states into the eu is the best way of stabilizing a region which is still suffering under the many years of ethnic strife in the 1990s and subsequent poverty , economic decline , crime and corruption . " the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

clubs in the german capital are grooving to the rhythms of bollywood , india ’ s flamboyant multi-billion dollar film industry , as a blend of bhangra and indipop woven with reggae and hip-hop elements set the beat . the dance floor at berlin ’ s café global is empty .
it ’ s still too early for the bollywood party to take off .
the strains of some indistinguishable oriental house music float around the spacious rooms as party-goers stand around , nurse their drinks and watch a choreographed dance sequence from an indian film unfold on a massive screen .
suddenly , the music stops and the dj switches tracks .
soon the unmistakable racing drumbeat of bhangra or punjabi pop explodes over the sound system .
the room is galvanized as the crowd swings into action , shaking their hips , swaying their hands and bobbing their heads to the infectious beats and raunchy punjabi lyrics .
the warm weather adds an authentic touch to the frenzied night , as berlin ’ s clubbers sweat it out till the early hours in temperatures comparable to bombay ’ s sizzling heat – the heartland of the bollywood wave rolling over berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhangra pop used to describe a film genre that involves endless extravagantly choreographed dance scenes , kitschy melodrama and heart-wrenchingly emotional songs , bollywood has now morphed into a club phenomenon .
a regular fixture on the club scene in london and paris , the so-called bollywood trend , which includes a broad palette of bhangra or punjabi pop , indipop and remixed hindi film music infused with reggae , hip-hop and techno elements , has arrived in berlin .
kitsch and glamor though only 23 , wekas gaba has already become somewhat of a dean on the berlin bollywood scene .

regularly playing in clubs such as oxymoron in berlin ’ s trendy mitte district , gaba ’ s colorful parties include the screening of indian films replete with extravagant dance and song numbers and glamorously-clad film stars .
often djs are flown in from the subcontinent to play the latest bollywood numbers and bhangra pop from the indian charts .
" we wanted to get in a bit of modern indian lifestyle in our parties , which is basically defined by music , dance , fashion and film , " gaba told deutsche welle .

" mundian to bach ke " stormed its way to second place on the german charts last december and tenaciously stayed in the top ten for months after .
the german success of the song didn ’ t just popularize bhangra – originally a folk dance and song performed during the harvest season in the north indian region of punjab and in recent decades mixed with reggae rhythms , hip-hop , r & b and garage influences by the punjabi diaspora in britain – but also helped the 32-year-old punjabi mc to fame in his native britain .

clubs in the german capital are grooving to the rhythms of bollywood , india ’ s flamboyant multi-billion dollar film industry , as a blend of bhangra and indipop woven with reggae and hip-hop elements set the beat . the dance floor at berlin ’ s café global is empty .
it ’ s still too early for the bollywood party to take off .
the strains of some indistinguishable oriental house music float around the spacious rooms as party-goers stand around , nurse their drinks and watch a choreographed dance sequence from an indian film unfold on a massive screen .
suddenly , the music stops and the dj switches tracks .
soon the unmistakable racing drumbeat of bhangra or punjabi pop explodes over the sound system .
the room is galvanized as the crowd swings into action , shaking their hips , swaying their hands and bobbing their heads to the infectious beats and raunchy punjabi lyrics .
the warm weather adds an authentic touch to the frenzied night , as berlin ’ s clubbers sweat it out till the early hours in temperatures comparable to bombay ’ s sizzling heat – the heartland of the bollywood wave rolling over berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhangra pop used to describe a film genre that involves endless extravagantly choreographed dance scenes , kitschy melodrama and heart-wrenchingly emotional songs , bollywood has now morphed into a club phenomenon .
a regular fixture on the club scene in london and paris , the so-called bollywood trend , which includes a broad palette of bhangra or punjabi pop , indipop and remixed hindi film music infused with reggae , hip-hop and techno elements , has arrived in berlin .
kitsch and glamor though only 23 , wekas gaba has already become somewhat of a dean on the berlin bollywood scene .
since last october the young afghan student of indian origin has been organizing bollywood parties in berlin ’ s clubs .
originally intended for the indian community in berlin , he expanded his two-dj act , dubbed " club deewane , " after realizing that " people here were suddenly interested in indian music and films . "
regularly playing in clubs such as oxymoron in berlin ’ s trendy mitte district , gaba ’ s colorful parties include the screening of indian films replete with extravagant dance and song numbers and glamorously-clad film stars .
often djs are flown in from the subcontinent to play the latest bollywood numbers and bhangra pop from the indian charts .
" we wanted to get in a bit of modern indian lifestyle in our parties , which is basically defined by music , dance , fashion and film , " gaba told deutsche welle .
" we realized that people here in europe are all of a sudden discovering indian fashion and music , which is elegant and stylish . "
getting down , bollywood style to ensure that europeans do n't shy away from the dancefloor , a dance studio in berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district offers some expert guidance on grooving to hindi film music .
on a recent thursday , elissavet angu , of greek-indian origin , takes six young uncertain germans through the complicated paces of a dance choreographed to a ditty from the popular bollywood film " devdas " .
rather self-consciously , the group attempts to coordinate the unfamiliar movements with the fitting facial expressions .
the graceful 30-year-old angu , who has trained in indian classical dance , says most of the young people who come to learn bollywood dance are either intrigued after watching bollywood films , have just been to india and are enamored of the culture or simply interested because india is suddenly " in . "
" it ’ s important that the people have a good feel for their bodies when it comes to bollywood dance , because one needs to coordinate hands , legs , the head and eyes at the same time , " she explains .
punjabi mc 's success key to bhangra boom the indian boom may be sudden in germany , but hardly anyone would argue that the unexpected european success of the bhangra pop number , " mundian to bach ke " by british asian artist punjabi mc is one of the main reasons why desi music and particularly bhangra is filling germany ’ s clubs .
" mundian to bach ke " stormed its way to second place on the german charts last december and tenaciously stayed in the top ten for months after .
the german success of the song didn ’ t just popularize bhangra – originally a folk dance and song performed during the harvest season in the north indian region of punjab and in recent decades mixed with reggae rhythms , hip-hop , r & b and garage influences by the punjabi diaspora in britain – but also helped the 32-year-old punjabi mc to fame in his native britain .
what you hear is what you get the broad indian music scene has been taken one step further by the urban karma club in the famed so 36 club in berlin ’ s turkish-dominated kreuzberg district .
there punjabi bhangra and indipop meet with arabic , african , chinese and japanese elements in a monthly lavish multicultural bash amid elaborate far-eastern decorations and shrill projector images on the walls .
but gaba remains clear that what he offers under his " bollywood labeling " is really remixes of indian film music and the current pop version of bhangra .
" we have no illusions of bringing in indian culture , i wouldn ’ t know how to do it , " he says .
the main thing is for people to enjoy themselves . " i have people coming up to me and saying , 'hey this really isn ’ t my kind of music , but somehow the atmosphere is fantastic , ' " gaba said .

the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .
but she went anyway , stating that she wanted to use the opportunity to visit the country and observe the policies firsthand .
later that year .
sontag ignited a firestorm of controversy with a relatively short – just 500 word - piece she wrote for the american magazine , the new yorker , a week after september 11th .
sontag wrote , " the unanimity of the sanctimonious , reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by american officials and media commentators in recent days seems , well , unworthy of a mature democracy . "
she went on to deride america 's " robotic president . "
most notably , citing the moral neutrality of the concept of a coward , she maintained that , " whatever may be said of the perpetrators of tuesday 's slaughter , they were not cowards . "
at a time when many had not yet processed the magnitude of events , and those like-minded did n't dare speak out , sontag 's provocative stance was noteworthy , if not universally accepted and indicative of her life-long defense of free thought .
in germany , where sontag ’ s works have been met with critical acclaim , the author enjoys something of an elite status as a commentator on u.s.-european relations in the country ’ s leading newspapers .
she has also recently been invited to lecture on poetics at the university of tübingen .

the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .
but she went anyway , stating that she wanted to use the opportunity to visit the country and observe the policies firsthand .
later that year .
sontag ignited a firestorm of controversy with a relatively short – just 500 word - piece she wrote for the american magazine , the new yorker , a week after september 11th .
sontag wrote , " the unanimity of the sanctimonious , reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by american officials and media commentators in recent days seems , well , unworthy of a mature democracy . "
she went on to deride america 's " robotic president . "
most notably , citing the moral neutrality of the concept of a coward , she maintained that , " whatever may be said of the perpetrators of tuesday 's slaughter , they were not cowards . "
at a time when many had not yet processed the magnitude of events , and those like-minded did n't dare speak out , sontag 's provocative stance was noteworthy , if not universally accepted and indicative of her life-long defense of free thought .
in germany , where sontag ’ s works have been met with critical acclaim , the author enjoys something of an elite status as a commentator on u.s.-european relations in the country ’ s leading newspapers .
she has also recently been invited to lecture on poetics at the university of tübingen .
sontag will be officially awarded the peace prize , which is worth € 15,000 -lrb- $ 17,000 -rrb- on october 12 during a ceremony at the frankfurt book fair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nigerian writer wins german peace prize in recognition of his work as a pioneering african novelist and moralist , the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association has awarded its peace prize for literature to the nigerian author chinua achebe -lrb- oct .

in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .
but she went anyway , stating that she wanted to use the opportunity to visit the country and observe the policies firsthand .
later that year .
sontag ignited a firestorm of controversy with a relatively short – just 500 word - piece she wrote for the american magazine , the new yorker , a week after september 11th .
sontag wrote , " the unanimity of the sanctimonious , reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by american officials and media commentators in recent days seems , well , unworthy of a mature democracy . "
she went on to deride america 's " robotic president . "
most notably , citing the moral neutrality of the concept of a coward , she maintained that , " whatever may be said of the perpetrators of tuesday 's slaughter , they were not cowards . "
at a time when many had not yet processed the magnitude of events , and those like-minded did n't dare speak out , sontag 's provocative stance was noteworthy , if not universally accepted and indicative of her life-long defense of free thought .
in germany , where sontag ’ s works have been met with critical acclaim , the author enjoys something of an elite status as a commentator on u.s.-european relations in the country ’ s leading newspapers .
she has also recently been invited to lecture on poetics at the university of tübingen .
sontag will be officially awarded the peace prize , which is worth € 15,000 -lrb- $ 17,000 -rrb- on october 12 during a ceremony at the frankfurt book fair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nigerian writer wins german peace prize in recognition of his work as a pioneering african novelist and moralist , the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association has awarded its peace prize for literature to the nigerian author chinua achebe -lrb- oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 21.06.2003 eu constitution dominates debate at summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a constitution the eu hopes to function better after enlargement a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .

on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .

immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .

five balkan countries hope to join the union within the next few years : albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro .
all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .
" we expect strong action on reforming state structures to eliminate the widespread curse of corruption " , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
" we expect energetic , totally firm action against organized crime " . saturday 's declaration states organized crime and corruption as the major obstacles for the balkans .
the region , which chris patten , the eu 's commissioner for external affairs , described as " one of the missing pieces in our jigsaw europe " , is europe 's poorest area and is still suffering from years of ethnic war in former yugoslavia . perspective , yes , exact dates , no at the summit , eu leaders stated the importance of encouraging the balkan countries to join the eu .
their future , they said , " is within the european union " . speaking on saturday , the german chancellor emphasized the necessity of giving the balkan states a perspective for membership .
europe 's boundaries were defined a long time ago , schröder said .
" one can not exclude ex-yugoslavia and the balkans from europe " . however , schröder refrained from naming an exact date for enlargement .
the process of democratization and the convergence of economic structures with the eu must be completed before membership could be obtained , schröder said . debate shifts outward the shift to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans comes after friday 's intense debate on the new draft european constitution . greece , which currently holds the rotating presidency , has been keen to make the union focus on the balkans – which lie between greece and most of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders believe that integrating the balkan states into the eu is the best way of stabilizing a region which is still suffering under the many years of ethnic strife in the 1990s and subsequent poverty , economic decline , crime and corruption . " the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit .

all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.06.2003 susan sontag wins german peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan sontag wins peace prize in recognition of her contribution to the defense of free thought .
the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .
but she went anyway , stating that she wanted to use the opportunity to visit the country and observe the policies firsthand .
later that year .
sontag ignited a firestorm of controversy with a relatively short – just 500 word - piece she wrote for the american magazine , the new yorker , a week after september 11th .
sontag wrote , " the unanimity of the sanctimonious , reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by american officials and media commentators in recent days seems , well , unworthy of a mature democracy . "
she went on to deride america 's " robotic president . "
most notably , citing the moral neutrality of the concept of a coward , she maintained that , " whatever may be said of the perpetrators of tuesday 's slaughter , they were not cowards . "
at a time when many had not yet processed the magnitude of events , and those like-minded did n't dare speak out , sontag 's provocative stance was noteworthy , if not universally accepted and indicative of her life-long defense of free thought .
in germany , where sontag ’ s works have been met with critical acclaim , the author enjoys something of an elite status as a commentator on u.s.-european relations in the country ’ s leading newspapers .
she has also recently been invited to lecture on poetics at the university of tübingen .
sontag will be officially awarded the peace prize , which is worth € 15,000 -lrb- $ 17,000 -rrb- on october 12 during a ceremony at the frankfurt book fair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nigerian writer wins german peace prize in recognition of his work as a pioneering african novelist and moralist , the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association has awarded its peace prize for literature to the nigerian author chinua achebe -lrb- oct .

the german success of the song didn ’ t just popularize bhangra – originally a folk dance and song performed during the harvest season in the north indian region of punjab and in recent decades mixed with reggae rhythms , hip-hop , r & b and garage influences by the punjabi diaspora in britain – but also helped the 32-year-old punjabi mc to fame in his native britain .

the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .
but she went anyway , stating that she wanted to use the opportunity to visit the country and observe the policies firsthand .
later that year .
sontag ignited a firestorm of controversy with a relatively short – just 500 word - piece she wrote for the american magazine , the new yorker , a week after september 11th .
sontag wrote , " the unanimity of the sanctimonious , reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by american officials and media commentators in recent days seems , well , unworthy of a mature democracy . "
she went on to deride america 's " robotic president . "
most notably , citing the moral neutrality of the concept of a coward , she maintained that , " whatever may be said of the perpetrators of tuesday 's slaughter , they were not cowards . "
at a time when many had not yet processed the magnitude of events , and those like-minded did n't dare speak out , sontag 's provocative stance was noteworthy , if not universally accepted and indicative of her life-long defense of free thought .
in germany , where sontag ’ s works have been met with critical acclaim , the author enjoys something of an elite status as a commentator on u.s.-european relations in the country ’ s leading newspapers .
she has also recently been invited to lecture on poetics at the university of tübingen .
sontag will be officially awarded the peace prize , which is worth € 15,000 -lrb- $ 17,000 -rrb- on october 12 during a ceremony at the frankfurt book fair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nigerian writer wins german peace prize in recognition of his work as a pioneering african novelist and moralist , the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association has awarded its peace prize for literature to the nigerian author chinua achebe -lrb- oct .

five balkan countries hope to join the union within the next few years : albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro .
all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .
" we expect strong action on reforming state structures to eliminate the widespread curse of corruption " , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
" we expect energetic , totally firm action against organized crime " . saturday 's declaration states organized crime and corruption as the major obstacles for the balkans .
the region , which chris patten , the eu 's commissioner for external affairs , described as " one of the missing pieces in our jigsaw europe " , is europe 's poorest area and is still suffering from years of ethnic war in former yugoslavia . perspective , yes , exact dates , no at the summit , eu leaders stated the importance of encouraging the balkan countries to join the eu .
their future , they said , " is within the european union " . speaking on saturday , the german chancellor emphasized the necessity of giving the balkan states a perspective for membership .
europe 's boundaries were defined a long time ago , schröder said .
" one can not exclude ex-yugoslavia and the balkans from europe " . however , schröder refrained from naming an exact date for enlargement .
the process of democratization and the convergence of economic structures with the eu must be completed before membership could be obtained , schröder said . debate shifts outward the shift to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans comes after friday 's intense debate on the new draft european constitution . greece , which currently holds the rotating presidency , has been keen to make the union focus on the balkans – which lie between greece and most of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders believe that integrating the balkan states into the eu is the best way of stabilizing a region which is still suffering under the many years of ethnic strife in the 1990s and subsequent poverty , economic decline , crime and corruption . " the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 21.06.2003 eu constitution dominates debate at summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a constitution the eu hopes to function better after enlargement a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .
but she went anyway , stating that she wanted to use the opportunity to visit the country and observe the policies firsthand .
later that year .
sontag ignited a firestorm of controversy with a relatively short – just 500 word - piece she wrote for the american magazine , the new yorker , a week after september 11th .
sontag wrote , " the unanimity of the sanctimonious , reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by american officials and media commentators in recent days seems , well , unworthy of a mature democracy . "
she went on to deride america 's " robotic president . "
most notably , citing the moral neutrality of the concept of a coward , she maintained that , " whatever may be said of the perpetrators of tuesday 's slaughter , they were not cowards . "
at a time when many had not yet processed the magnitude of events , and those like-minded did n't dare speak out , sontag 's provocative stance was noteworthy , if not universally accepted and indicative of her life-long defense of free thought .

immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .
but she went anyway , stating that she wanted to use the opportunity to visit the country and observe the policies firsthand .
later that year .
sontag ignited a firestorm of controversy with a relatively short – just 500 word - piece she wrote for the american magazine , the new yorker , a week after september 11th .
sontag wrote , " the unanimity of the sanctimonious , reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by american officials and media commentators in recent days seems , well , unworthy of a mature democracy . "
she went on to deride america 's " robotic president . "
most notably , citing the moral neutrality of the concept of a coward , she maintained that , " whatever may be said of the perpetrators of tuesday 's slaughter , they were not cowards . "
at a time when many had not yet processed the magnitude of events , and those like-minded did n't dare speak out , sontag 's provocative stance was noteworthy , if not universally accepted and indicative of her life-long defense of free thought .
in germany , where sontag ’ s works have been met with critical acclaim , the author enjoys something of an elite status as a commentator on u.s.-european relations in the country ’ s leading newspapers .
she has also recently been invited to lecture on poetics at the university of tübingen .
sontag will be officially awarded the peace prize , which is worth € 15,000 -lrb- $ 17,000 -rrb- on october 12 during a ceremony at the frankfurt book fair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nigerian writer wins german peace prize in recognition of his work as a pioneering african novelist and moralist , the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association has awarded its peace prize for literature to the nigerian author chinua achebe -lrb- oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 21.06.2003 eu constitution dominates debate at summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a constitution the eu hopes to function better after enlargement a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

five balkan countries hope to join the union within the next few years : albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro .
all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .
" we expect strong action on reforming state structures to eliminate the widespread curse of corruption " , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
" we expect energetic , totally firm action against organized crime " . saturday 's declaration states organized crime and corruption as the major obstacles for the balkans .
the region , which chris patten , the eu 's commissioner for external affairs , described as " one of the missing pieces in our jigsaw europe " , is europe 's poorest area and is still suffering from years of ethnic war in former yugoslavia . perspective , yes , exact dates , no at the summit , eu leaders stated the importance of encouraging the balkan countries to join the eu .
their future , they said , " is within the european union " . speaking on saturday , the german chancellor emphasized the necessity of giving the balkan states a perspective for membership .
europe 's boundaries were defined a long time ago , schröder said .
" one can not exclude ex-yugoslavia and the balkans from europe " . however , schröder refrained from naming an exact date for enlargement .
the process of democratization and the convergence of economic structures with the eu must be completed before membership could be obtained , schröder said . debate shifts outward the shift to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans comes after friday 's intense debate on the new draft european constitution . greece , which currently holds the rotating presidency , has been keen to make the union focus on the balkans – which lie between greece and most of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders believe that integrating the balkan states into the eu is the best way of stabilizing a region which is still suffering under the many years of ethnic strife in the 1990s and subsequent poverty , economic decline , crime and corruption . " the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.06.2003 susan sontag wins german peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan sontag wins peace prize in recognition of her contribution to the defense of free thought .
the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .
but she went anyway , stating that she wanted to use the opportunity to visit the country and observe the policies firsthand .
later that year .
sontag ignited a firestorm of controversy with a relatively short – just 500 word - piece she wrote for the american magazine , the new yorker , a week after september 11th .
sontag wrote , " the unanimity of the sanctimonious , reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by american officials and media commentators in recent days seems , well , unworthy of a mature democracy . "
she went on to deride america 's " robotic president . "
most notably , citing the moral neutrality of the concept of a coward , she maintained that , " whatever may be said of the perpetrators of tuesday 's slaughter , they were not cowards . "
at a time when many had not yet processed the magnitude of events , and those like-minded did n't dare speak out , sontag 's provocative stance was noteworthy , if not universally accepted and indicative of her life-long defense of free thought .
in germany , where sontag ’ s works have been met with critical acclaim , the author enjoys something of an elite status as a commentator on u.s.-european relations in the country ’ s leading newspapers .
she has also recently been invited to lecture on poetics at the university of tübingen .
sontag will be officially awarded the peace prize , which is worth € 15,000 -lrb- $ 17,000 -rrb- on october 12 during a ceremony at the frankfurt book fair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nigerian writer wins german peace prize in recognition of his work as a pioneering african novelist and moralist , the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association has awarded its peace prize for literature to the nigerian author chinua achebe -lrb- oct .

immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

five balkan countries hope to join the union within the next few years : albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro .
all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .
" we expect strong action on reforming state structures to eliminate the widespread curse of corruption " , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
" we expect energetic , totally firm action against organized crime " . saturday 's declaration states organized crime and corruption as the major obstacles for the balkans .
the region , which chris patten , the eu 's commissioner for external affairs , described as " one of the missing pieces in our jigsaw europe " , is europe 's poorest area and is still suffering from years of ethnic war in former yugoslavia . perspective , yes , exact dates , no at the summit , eu leaders stated the importance of encouraging the balkan countries to join the eu .
their future , they said , " is within the european union " . speaking on saturday , the german chancellor emphasized the necessity of giving the balkan states a perspective for membership .
europe 's boundaries were defined a long time ago , schröder said .
" one can not exclude ex-yugoslavia and the balkans from europe " . however , schröder refrained from naming an exact date for enlargement .
the process of democratization and the convergence of economic structures with the eu must be completed before membership could be obtained , schröder said . debate shifts outward the shift to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans comes after friday 's intense debate on the new draft european constitution . greece , which currently holds the rotating presidency , has been keen to make the union focus on the balkans – which lie between greece and most of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders believe that integrating the balkan states into the eu is the best way of stabilizing a region which is still suffering under the many years of ethnic strife in the 1990s and subsequent poverty , economic decline , crime and corruption . " the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit .

five balkan countries hope to join the union within the next few years : albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro .
all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .
" we expect strong action on reforming state structures to eliminate the widespread curse of corruption " , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
" we expect energetic , totally firm action against organized crime " . saturday 's declaration states organized crime and corruption as the major obstacles for the balkans .
the region , which chris patten , the eu 's commissioner for external affairs , described as " one of the missing pieces in our jigsaw europe " , is europe 's poorest area and is still suffering from years of ethnic war in former yugoslavia . perspective , yes , exact dates , no at the summit , eu leaders stated the importance of encouraging the balkan countries to join the eu .
their future , they said , " is within the european union " . speaking on saturday , the german chancellor emphasized the necessity of giving the balkan states a perspective for membership .
europe 's boundaries were defined a long time ago , schröder said .
" one can not exclude ex-yugoslavia and the balkans from europe " . however , schröder refrained from naming an exact date for enlargement .
the process of democratization and the convergence of economic structures with the eu must be completed before membership could be obtained , schröder said . debate shifts outward the shift to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans comes after friday 's intense debate on the new draft european constitution . greece , which currently holds the rotating presidency , has been keen to make the union focus on the balkans – which lie between greece and most of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders believe that integrating the balkan states into the eu is the best way of stabilizing a region which is still suffering under the many years of ethnic strife in the 1990s and subsequent poverty , economic decline , crime and corruption . " the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit .

clubs in the german capital are grooving to the rhythms of bollywood , india ’ s flamboyant multi-billion dollar film industry , as a blend of bhangra and indipop woven with reggae and hip-hop elements set the beat . the dance floor at berlin ’ s café global is empty .
it ’ s still too early for the bollywood party to take off .
the strains of some indistinguishable oriental house music float around the spacious rooms as party-goers stand around , nurse their drinks and watch a choreographed dance sequence from an indian film unfold on a massive screen .
suddenly , the music stops and the dj switches tracks .
soon the unmistakable racing drumbeat of bhangra or punjabi pop explodes over the sound system .
the room is galvanized as the crowd swings into action , shaking their hips , swaying their hands and bobbing their heads to the infectious beats and raunchy punjabi lyrics .
the warm weather adds an authentic touch to the frenzied night , as berlin ’ s clubbers sweat it out till the early hours in temperatures comparable to bombay ’ s sizzling heat – the heartland of the bollywood wave rolling over berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhangra pop used to describe a film genre that involves endless extravagantly choreographed dance scenes , kitschy melodrama and heart-wrenchingly emotional songs , bollywood has now morphed into a club phenomenon .
a regular fixture on the club scene in london and paris , the so-called bollywood trend , which includes a broad palette of bhangra or punjabi pop , indipop and remixed hindi film music infused with reggae , hip-hop and techno elements , has arrived in berlin .
kitsch and glamor though only 23 , wekas gaba has already become somewhat of a dean on the berlin bollywood scene .
since last october the young afghan student of indian origin has been organizing bollywood parties in berlin ’ s clubs .
originally intended for the indian community in berlin , he expanded his two-dj act , dubbed " club deewane , " after realizing that " people here were suddenly interested in indian music and films . "
regularly playing in clubs such as oxymoron in berlin ’ s trendy mitte district , gaba ’ s colorful parties include the screening of indian films replete with extravagant dance and song numbers and glamorously-clad film stars .
often djs are flown in from the subcontinent to play the latest bollywood numbers and bhangra pop from the indian charts .
" we wanted to get in a bit of modern indian lifestyle in our parties , which is basically defined by music , dance , fashion and film , " gaba told deutsche welle .
" we realized that people here in europe are all of a sudden discovering indian fashion and music , which is elegant and stylish . "
getting down , bollywood style to ensure that europeans do n't shy away from the dancefloor , a dance studio in berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district offers some expert guidance on grooving to hindi film music .
on a recent thursday , elissavet angu , of greek-indian origin , takes six young uncertain germans through the complicated paces of a dance choreographed to a ditty from the popular bollywood film " devdas " .
rather self-consciously , the group attempts to coordinate the unfamiliar movements with the fitting facial expressions .
the graceful 30-year-old angu , who has trained in indian classical dance , says most of the young people who come to learn bollywood dance are either intrigued after watching bollywood films , have just been to india and are enamored of the culture or simply interested because india is suddenly " in . "
" it ’ s important that the people have a good feel for their bodies when it comes to bollywood dance , because one needs to coordinate hands , legs , the head and eyes at the same time , " she explains .
punjabi mc 's success key to bhangra boom the indian boom may be sudden in germany , but hardly anyone would argue that the unexpected european success of the bhangra pop number , " mundian to bach ke " by british asian artist punjabi mc is one of the main reasons why desi music and particularly bhangra is filling germany ’ s clubs .
" mundian to bach ke " stormed its way to second place on the german charts last december and tenaciously stayed in the top ten for months after .
the german success of the song didn ’ t just popularize bhangra – originally a folk dance and song performed during the harvest season in the north indian region of punjab and in recent decades mixed with reggae rhythms , hip-hop , r & b and garage influences by the punjabi diaspora in britain – but also helped the 32-year-old punjabi mc to fame in his native britain .
what you hear is what you get the broad indian music scene has been taken one step further by the urban karma club in the famed so 36 club in berlin ’ s turkish-dominated kreuzberg district .
there punjabi bhangra and indipop meet with arabic , african , chinese and japanese elements in a monthly lavish multicultural bash amid elaborate far-eastern decorations and shrill projector images on the walls .
but gaba remains clear that what he offers under his " bollywood labeling " is really remixes of indian film music and the current pop version of bhangra .
" we have no illusions of bringing in indian culture , i wouldn ’ t know how to do it , " he says .
the main thing is for people to enjoy themselves . " i have people coming up to me and saying , 'hey this really isn ’ t my kind of music , but somehow the atmosphere is fantastic , ' " gaba said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 21.06.2003 eu constitution dominates debate at summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a constitution the eu hopes to function better after enlargement a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .
but she went anyway , stating that she wanted to use the opportunity to visit the country and observe the policies firsthand .
later that year .
sontag ignited a firestorm of controversy with a relatively short – just 500 word - piece she wrote for the american magazine , the new yorker , a week after september 11th .
sontag wrote , " the unanimity of the sanctimonious , reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by american officials and media commentators in recent days seems , well , unworthy of a mature democracy . "
she went on to deride america 's " robotic president . "
most notably , citing the moral neutrality of the concept of a coward , she maintained that , " whatever may be said of the perpetrators of tuesday 's slaughter , they were not cowards . "
at a time when many had not yet processed the magnitude of events , and those like-minded did n't dare speak out , sontag 's provocative stance was noteworthy , if not universally accepted and indicative of her life-long defense of free thought .
in germany , where sontag ’ s works have been met with critical acclaim , the author enjoys something of an elite status as a commentator on u.s.-european relations in the country ’ s leading newspapers .
she has also recently been invited to lecture on poetics at the university of tübingen .
sontag will be officially awarded the peace prize , which is worth € 15,000 -lrb- $ 17,000 -rrb- on october 12 during a ceremony at the frankfurt book fair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nigerian writer wins german peace prize in recognition of his work as a pioneering african novelist and moralist , the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association has awarded its peace prize for literature to the nigerian author chinua achebe -lrb- oct .

the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 21.06.2003 eu constitution dominates debate at summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a constitution the eu hopes to function better after enlargement a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .

immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .

clubs in the german capital are grooving to the rhythms of bollywood , india ’ s flamboyant multi-billion dollar film industry , as a blend of bhangra and indipop woven with reggae and hip-hop elements set the beat . the dance floor at berlin ’ s café global is empty .
it ’ s still too early for the bollywood party to take off .
the strains of some indistinguishable oriental house music float around the spacious rooms as party-goers stand around , nurse their drinks and watch a choreographed dance sequence from an indian film unfold on a massive screen .
suddenly , the music stops and the dj switches tracks .
soon the unmistakable racing drumbeat of bhangra or punjabi pop explodes over the sound system .
the room is galvanized as the crowd swings into action , shaking their hips , swaying their hands and bobbing their heads to the infectious beats and raunchy punjabi lyrics .
the warm weather adds an authentic touch to the frenzied night , as berlin ’ s clubbers sweat it out till the early hours in temperatures comparable to bombay ’ s sizzling heat – the heartland of the bollywood wave rolling over berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhangra pop used to describe a film genre that involves endless extravagantly choreographed dance scenes , kitschy melodrama and heart-wrenchingly emotional songs , bollywood has now morphed into a club phenomenon .
a regular fixture on the club scene in london and paris , the so-called bollywood trend , which includes a broad palette of bhangra or punjabi pop , indipop and remixed hindi film music infused with reggae , hip-hop and techno elements , has arrived in berlin .
kitsch and glamor though only 23 , wekas gaba has already become somewhat of a dean on the berlin bollywood scene .
since last october the young afghan student of indian origin has been organizing bollywood parties in berlin ’ s clubs .
originally intended for the indian community in berlin , he expanded his two-dj act , dubbed " club deewane , " after realizing that " people here were suddenly interested in indian music and films . "
regularly playing in clubs such as oxymoron in berlin ’ s trendy mitte district , gaba ’ s colorful parties include the screening of indian films replete with extravagant dance and song numbers and glamorously-clad film stars .
often djs are flown in from the subcontinent to play the latest bollywood numbers and bhangra pop from the indian charts .
" we wanted to get in a bit of modern indian lifestyle in our parties , which is basically defined by music , dance , fashion and film , " gaba told deutsche welle .
" we realized that people here in europe are all of a sudden discovering indian fashion and music , which is elegant and stylish . "
getting down , bollywood style to ensure that europeans do n't shy away from the dancefloor , a dance studio in berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district offers some expert guidance on grooving to hindi film music .
on a recent thursday , elissavet angu , of greek-indian origin , takes six young uncertain germans through the complicated paces of a dance choreographed to a ditty from the popular bollywood film " devdas " .
rather self-consciously , the group attempts to coordinate the unfamiliar movements with the fitting facial expressions .
the graceful 30-year-old angu , who has trained in indian classical dance , says most of the young people who come to learn bollywood dance are either intrigued after watching bollywood films , have just been to india and are enamored of the culture or simply interested because india is suddenly " in . "
" it ’ s important that the people have a good feel for their bodies when it comes to bollywood dance , because one needs to coordinate hands , legs , the head and eyes at the same time , " she explains .
punjabi mc 's success key to bhangra boom the indian boom may be sudden in germany , but hardly anyone would argue that the unexpected european success of the bhangra pop number , " mundian to bach ke " by british asian artist punjabi mc is one of the main reasons why desi music and particularly bhangra is filling germany ’ s clubs .
" mundian to bach ke " stormed its way to second place on the german charts last december and tenaciously stayed in the top ten for months after .
the german success of the song didn ’ t just popularize bhangra – originally a folk dance and song performed during the harvest season in the north indian region of punjab and in recent decades mixed with reggae rhythms , hip-hop , r & b and garage influences by the punjabi diaspora in britain – but also helped the 32-year-old punjabi mc to fame in his native britain .
what you hear is what you get the broad indian music scene has been taken one step further by the urban karma club in the famed so 36 club in berlin ’ s turkish-dominated kreuzberg district .
there punjabi bhangra and indipop meet with arabic , african , chinese and japanese elements in a monthly lavish multicultural bash amid elaborate far-eastern decorations and shrill projector images on the walls .
but gaba remains clear that what he offers under his " bollywood labeling " is really remixes of indian film music and the current pop version of bhangra .
" we have no illusions of bringing in indian culture , i wouldn ’ t know how to do it , " he says .
the main thing is for people to enjoy themselves . " i have people coming up to me and saying , 'hey this really isn ’ t my kind of music , but somehow the atmosphere is fantastic , ' " gaba said .

five balkan countries hope to join the union within the next few years : albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro .
all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .
" we expect strong action on reforming state structures to eliminate the widespread curse of corruption " , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
" we expect energetic , totally firm action against organized crime " . saturday 's declaration states organized crime and corruption as the major obstacles for the balkans .
the region , which chris patten , the eu 's commissioner for external affairs , described as " one of the missing pieces in our jigsaw europe " , is europe 's poorest area and is still suffering from years of ethnic war in former yugoslavia . perspective , yes , exact dates , no at the summit , eu leaders stated the importance of encouraging the balkan countries to join the eu .
their future , they said , " is within the european union " . speaking on saturday , the german chancellor emphasized the necessity of giving the balkan states a perspective for membership .
europe 's boundaries were defined a long time ago , schröder said .
" one can not exclude ex-yugoslavia and the balkans from europe " . however , schröder refrained from naming an exact date for enlargement .
the process of democratization and the convergence of economic structures with the eu must be completed before membership could be obtained , schröder said . debate shifts outward the shift to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans comes after friday 's intense debate on the new draft european constitution . greece , which currently holds the rotating presidency , has been keen to make the union focus on the balkans – which lie between greece and most of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders believe that integrating the balkan states into the eu is the best way of stabilizing a region which is still suffering under the many years of ethnic strife in the 1990s and subsequent poverty , economic decline , crime and corruption . " the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit .

" the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit .

clubs in the german capital are grooving to the rhythms of bollywood , india ’ s flamboyant multi-billion dollar film industry , as a blend of bhangra and indipop woven with reggae and hip-hop elements set the beat . the dance floor at berlin ’ s café global is empty .
it ’ s still too early for the bollywood party to take off .
the strains of some indistinguishable oriental house music float around the spacious rooms as party-goers stand around , nurse their drinks and watch a choreographed dance sequence from an indian film unfold on a massive screen .
suddenly , the music stops and the dj switches tracks .
soon the unmistakable racing drumbeat of bhangra or punjabi pop explodes over the sound system .
the room is galvanized as the crowd swings into action , shaking their hips , swaying their hands and bobbing their heads to the infectious beats and raunchy punjabi lyrics .
the warm weather adds an authentic touch to the frenzied night , as berlin ’ s clubbers sweat it out till the early hours in temperatures comparable to bombay ’ s sizzling heat – the heartland of the bollywood wave rolling over berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhangra pop used to describe a film genre that involves endless extravagantly choreographed dance scenes , kitschy melodrama and heart-wrenchingly emotional songs , bollywood has now morphed into a club phenomenon .
a regular fixture on the club scene in london and paris , the so-called bollywood trend , which includes a broad palette of bhangra or punjabi pop , indipop and remixed hindi film music infused with reggae , hip-hop and techno elements , has arrived in berlin .
kitsch and glamor though only 23 , wekas gaba has already become somewhat of a dean on the berlin bollywood scene .
since last october the young afghan student of indian origin has been organizing bollywood parties in berlin ’ s clubs .
originally intended for the indian community in berlin , he expanded his two-dj act , dubbed " club deewane , " after realizing that " people here were suddenly interested in indian music and films . "
regularly playing in clubs such as oxymoron in berlin ’ s trendy mitte district , gaba ’ s colorful parties include the screening of indian films replete with extravagant dance and song numbers and glamorously-clad film stars .
often djs are flown in from the subcontinent to play the latest bollywood numbers and bhangra pop from the indian charts .
" we wanted to get in a bit of modern indian lifestyle in our parties , which is basically defined by music , dance , fashion and film , " gaba told deutsche welle .
" we realized that people here in europe are all of a sudden discovering indian fashion and music , which is elegant and stylish . "
getting down , bollywood style to ensure that europeans do n't shy away from the dancefloor , a dance studio in berlin ’ s prenzlauer berg district offers some expert guidance on grooving to hindi film music .
on a recent thursday , elissavet angu , of greek-indian origin , takes six young uncertain germans through the complicated paces of a dance choreographed to a ditty from the popular bollywood film " devdas " .
rather self-consciously , the group attempts to coordinate the unfamiliar movements with the fitting facial expressions .
the graceful 30-year-old angu , who has trained in indian classical dance , says most of the young people who come to learn bollywood dance are either intrigued after watching bollywood films , have just been to india and are enamored of the culture or simply interested because india is suddenly " in . "
" it ’ s important that the people have a good feel for their bodies when it comes to bollywood dance , because one needs to coordinate hands , legs , the head and eyes at the same time , " she explains .
punjabi mc 's success key to bhangra boom the indian boom may be sudden in germany , but hardly anyone would argue that the unexpected european success of the bhangra pop number , " mundian to bach ke " by british asian artist punjabi mc is one of the main reasons why desi music and particularly bhangra is filling germany ’ s clubs .
" mundian to bach ke " stormed its way to second place on the german charts last december and tenaciously stayed in the top ten for months after .
the german success of the song didn ’ t just popularize bhangra – originally a folk dance and song performed during the harvest season in the north indian region of punjab and in recent decades mixed with reggae rhythms , hip-hop , r & b and garage influences by the punjabi diaspora in britain – but also helped the 32-year-old punjabi mc to fame in his native britain .
what you hear is what you get the broad indian music scene has been taken one step further by the urban karma club in the famed so 36 club in berlin ’ s turkish-dominated kreuzberg district .
there punjabi bhangra and indipop meet with arabic , african , chinese and japanese elements in a monthly lavish multicultural bash amid elaborate far-eastern decorations and shrill projector images on the walls .
but gaba remains clear that what he offers under his " bollywood labeling " is really remixes of indian film music and the current pop version of bhangra .
" we have no illusions of bringing in indian culture , i wouldn ’ t know how to do it , " he says .
the main thing is for people to enjoy themselves . " i have people coming up to me and saying , 'hey this really isn ’ t my kind of music , but somehow the atmosphere is fantastic , ' " gaba said .
" that ’ s what counts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 21.06.2003 eu constitution dominates debate at summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a constitution the eu hopes to function better after enlargement a proposed draft for an eu constitution dominated debate at the european union leaders ' meeting in greece .
immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

on a recent thursday , elissavet angu , of greek-indian origin , takes six young uncertain germans through the complicated paces of a dance choreographed to a ditty from the popular bollywood film " devdas " .
rather self-consciously , the group attempts to coordinate the unfamiliar movements with the fitting facial expressions .
the graceful 30-year-old angu , who has trained in indian classical dance , says most of the young people who come to learn bollywood dance are either intrigued after watching bollywood films , have just been to india and are enamored of the culture or simply interested because india is suddenly " in . "
" it ’ s important that the people have a good feel for their bodies when it comes to bollywood dance , because one needs to coordinate hands , legs , the head and eyes at the same time , " she explains .
punjabi mc 's success key to bhangra boom the indian boom may be sudden in germany , but hardly anyone would argue that the unexpected european success of the bhangra pop number , " mundian to bach ke " by british asian artist punjabi mc is one of the main reasons why desi music and particularly bhangra is filling germany ’ s clubs .
" mundian to bach ke " stormed its way to second place on the german charts last december and tenaciously stayed in the top ten for months after .
the german success of the song didn ’ t just popularize bhangra – originally a folk dance and song performed during the harvest season in the north indian region of punjab and in recent decades mixed with reggae rhythms , hip-hop , r & b and garage influences by the punjabi diaspora in britain – but also helped the 32-year-old punjabi mc to fame in his native britain .
what you hear is what you get the broad indian music scene has been taken one step further by the urban karma club in the famed so 36 club in berlin ’ s turkish-dominated kreuzberg district .
there punjabi bhangra and indipop meet with arabic , african , chinese and japanese elements in a monthly lavish multicultural bash amid elaborate far-eastern decorations and shrill projector images on the walls .
but gaba remains clear that what he offers under his " bollywood labeling " is really remixes of indian film music and the current pop version of bhangra .
" we have no illusions of bringing in indian culture , i wouldn ’ t know how to do it , " he says .
the main thing is for people to enjoy themselves . " i have people coming up to me and saying , 'hey this really isn ’ t my kind of music , but somehow the atmosphere is fantastic , ' " gaba said .

the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .
but she went anyway , stating that she wanted to use the opportunity to visit the country and observe the policies firsthand .
later that year .
sontag ignited a firestorm of controversy with a relatively short – just 500 word - piece she wrote for the american magazine , the new yorker , a week after september 11th .
sontag wrote , " the unanimity of the sanctimonious , reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by american officials and media commentators in recent days seems , well , unworthy of a mature democracy . "
she went on to deride america 's " robotic president . "
most notably , citing the moral neutrality of the concept of a coward , she maintained that , " whatever may be said of the perpetrators of tuesday 's slaughter , they were not cowards . "
at a time when many had not yet processed the magnitude of events , and those like-minded did n't dare speak out , sontag 's provocative stance was noteworthy , if not universally accepted and indicative of her life-long defense of free thought .
in germany , where sontag ’ s works have been met with critical acclaim , the author enjoys something of an elite status as a commentator on u.s.-european relations in the country ’ s leading newspapers .
she has also recently been invited to lecture on poetics at the university of tübingen .

five balkan countries hope to join the union within the next few years : albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro .
all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .
" we expect strong action on reforming state structures to eliminate the widespread curse of corruption " , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
" we expect energetic , totally firm action against organized crime " . saturday 's declaration states organized crime and corruption as the major obstacles for the balkans .
the region , which chris patten , the eu 's commissioner for external affairs , described as " one of the missing pieces in our jigsaw europe " , is europe 's poorest area and is still suffering from years of ethnic war in former yugoslavia . perspective , yes , exact dates , no at the summit , eu leaders stated the importance of encouraging the balkan countries to join the eu .
their future , they said , " is within the european union " . speaking on saturday , the german chancellor emphasized the necessity of giving the balkan states a perspective for membership .
europe 's boundaries were defined a long time ago , schröder said .
" one can not exclude ex-yugoslavia and the balkans from europe " . however , schröder refrained from naming an exact date for enlargement .
the process of democratization and the convergence of economic structures with the eu must be completed before membership could be obtained , schröder said . debate shifts outward the shift to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans comes after friday 's intense debate on the new draft european constitution . greece , which currently holds the rotating presidency , has been keen to make the union focus on the balkans – which lie between greece and most of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders believe that integrating the balkan states into the eu is the best way of stabilizing a region which is still suffering under the many years of ethnic strife in the 1990s and subsequent poverty , economic decline , crime and corruption . " the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit .

" the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.06.2003 susan sontag wins german peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan sontag wins peace prize in recognition of her contribution to the defense of free thought .
the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .
but she went anyway , stating that she wanted to use the opportunity to visit the country and observe the policies firsthand .
later that year .
sontag ignited a firestorm of controversy with a relatively short – just 500 word - piece she wrote for the american magazine , the new yorker , a week after september 11th .
sontag wrote , " the unanimity of the sanctimonious , reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by american officials and media commentators in recent days seems , well , unworthy of a mature democracy . "
she went on to deride america 's " robotic president . "
most notably , citing the moral neutrality of the concept of a coward , she maintained that , " whatever may be said of the perpetrators of tuesday 's slaughter , they were not cowards . "
at a time when many had not yet processed the magnitude of events , and those like-minded did n't dare speak out , sontag 's provocative stance was noteworthy , if not universally accepted and indicative of her life-long defense of free thought .
in germany , where sontag ’ s works have been met with critical acclaim , the author enjoys something of an elite status as a commentator on u.s.-european relations in the country ’ s leading newspapers .
she has also recently been invited to lecture on poetics at the university of tübingen .
sontag will be officially awarded the peace prize , which is worth € 15,000 -lrb- $ 17,000 -rrb- on october 12 during a ceremony at the frankfurt book fair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nigerian writer wins german peace prize in recognition of his work as a pioneering african novelist and moralist , the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association has awarded its peace prize for literature to the nigerian author chinua achebe -lrb- oct .

the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .
but she went anyway , stating that she wanted to use the opportunity to visit the country and observe the policies firsthand .
later that year .
sontag ignited a firestorm of controversy with a relatively short – just 500 word - piece she wrote for the american magazine , the new yorker , a week after september 11th .
sontag wrote , " the unanimity of the sanctimonious , reality-concealing rhetoric spouted by american officials and media commentators in recent days seems , well , unworthy of a mature democracy . "
she went on to deride america 's " robotic president . "
most notably , citing the moral neutrality of the concept of a coward , she maintained that , " whatever may be said of the perpetrators of tuesday 's slaughter , they were not cowards . "
at a time when many had not yet processed the magnitude of events , and those like-minded did n't dare speak out , sontag 's provocative stance was noteworthy , if not universally accepted and indicative of her life-long defense of free thought .
in germany , where sontag ’ s works have been met with critical acclaim , the author enjoys something of an elite status as a commentator on u.s.-european relations in the country ’ s leading newspapers .
she has also recently been invited to lecture on poetics at the university of tübingen .

five balkan countries hope to join the union within the next few years : albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro .
all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .
" we expect strong action on reforming state structures to eliminate the widespread curse of corruption " , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
" we expect energetic , totally firm action against organized crime " . saturday 's declaration states organized crime and corruption as the major obstacles for the balkans .
the region , which chris patten , the eu 's commissioner for external affairs , described as " one of the missing pieces in our jigsaw europe " , is europe 's poorest area and is still suffering from years of ethnic war in former yugoslavia . perspective , yes , exact dates , no at the summit , eu leaders stated the importance of encouraging the balkan countries to join the eu .
their future , they said , " is within the european union " . speaking on saturday , the german chancellor emphasized the necessity of giving the balkan states a perspective for membership .
europe 's boundaries were defined a long time ago , schröder said .
" one can not exclude ex-yugoslavia and the balkans from europe " . however , schröder refrained from naming an exact date for enlargement .
the process of democratization and the convergence of economic structures with the eu must be completed before membership could be obtained , schröder said . debate shifts outward the shift to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans comes after friday 's intense debate on the new draft european constitution . greece , which currently holds the rotating presidency , has been keen to make the union focus on the balkans – which lie between greece and most of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders believe that integrating the balkan states into the eu is the best way of stabilizing a region which is still suffering under the many years of ethnic strife in the 1990s and subsequent poverty , economic decline , crime and corruption . " the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit .

immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .

it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

five balkan countries hope to join the union within the next few years : albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro .
all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .
" we expect strong action on reforming state structures to eliminate the widespread curse of corruption " , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
" we expect energetic , totally firm action against organized crime " . saturday 's declaration states organized crime and corruption as the major obstacles for the balkans .
the region , which chris patten , the eu 's commissioner for external affairs , described as " one of the missing pieces in our jigsaw europe " , is europe 's poorest area and is still suffering from years of ethnic war in former yugoslavia . perspective , yes , exact dates , no at the summit , eu leaders stated the importance of encouraging the balkan countries to join the eu .
their future , they said , " is within the european union " . speaking on saturday , the german chancellor emphasized the necessity of giving the balkan states a perspective for membership .
europe 's boundaries were defined a long time ago , schröder said .
" one can not exclude ex-yugoslavia and the balkans from europe " . however , schröder refrained from naming an exact date for enlargement .
the process of democratization and the convergence of economic structures with the eu must be completed before membership could be obtained , schröder said . debate shifts outward the shift to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans comes after friday 's intense debate on the new draft european constitution . greece , which currently holds the rotating presidency , has been keen to make the union focus on the balkans – which lie between greece and most of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders believe that integrating the balkan states into the eu is the best way of stabilizing a region which is still suffering under the many years of ethnic strife in the 1990s and subsequent poverty , economic decline , crime and corruption . " the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.06.2003 susan sontag wins german peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susan sontag wins peace prize in recognition of her contribution to the defense of free thought .
the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .

the controversial american writer and critic , susan sontag , is this year 's recipient of the german book trade 's prestigious peace prize . susan sontag has won the german book trade 's peace prize for defending free thought , the german publishers and booksellers association announced tuesday .
sontag , a writer , critic , playwright and commentator , is well known on both sides of the atlantic .
a student of european literature and philosophy , she 's famous for - among many things – helping to bridge the cultural divide between america and europe -lrb- though she herself has referred to it as being as deep as the " grand canyon " -rrb- .
in a statement accompanying the announcement , the german publishers and booksellers association lauded the 70-year-old sontag as " the most prominent intellectual ambassador between the two continents . "
they have signaled her out for " defending honor and free thought in a world of false images and distorted truths " .
most notably , sontag has been an adamant critic of the war in iraq and president george w. bush ’ s foreign policy .
for europeans struggling to make sense of america 's hegemonic neo-realist policies , sontag 's writing represents a welcomed voice of reason from across the pond and at times mirrors their own outrage .
embracing many forms as an artist and intellectual , sontag has embraced - and some would say mastered - many forms .
she originally gained prominence as an essayist in 1966 with the publication of her first collection , against interpretation .
a tour-de-force , the work covered a wide range of cultural topics , both high and low , spanning sartre , camus , godard , science fiction , and psychoanalysis - all woven together with a distinctive voice .
since then , sontag brought out several more collections of essays , wrote frequently for many prestigious newspapers and magazines , published several novels , and directed four films and several plays .
her most recent novel , in america , won the national book critics circle award in 2000 .
and her latest collection of essays , regarding the pain of others , an examination of contemporary depictions of war , was released in february of this year .
the german version will be in stores in august .
defending freedom of thought throughout her career , sontag has been a human rights activist .
from 1987 to 1989 she served as president of the american chapter of pen , the international writer ’ s organization dedicated to the defense of free expression and the advancement of literature .
she has also led a number of campaigns on behalf of persecuted and imprisoned writers .
from 1993 to 1996 , sontag lived out what she preached and went to work in besieged sarajevo , where she brought attention to the city ’ s struggling literary scene with her staging of beckett ’ s waiting for godot .
accolades and controversy susan sontag has never shied away from controversy - always eager to make her political views visible in her work .
as a result she has received both praise and criticism , often at the same time for the same work .
in may of 2001 , sontag was awarded the jerusalem prize , awarded at the jerusalem international book fair .
many activists advocating the palestinian position urged sontag to decline the invitation in protest of ariel sharon 's policies .

immigration and asylum policy were also high on the agenda of the three-day summit . on the second day of the european union summit in porto carras , greece , eu leaders turned their attention to the primary purpose of their gathering – the discussion of a landmark draft constitution aimed at reforming the union ’ s lumbering institutions ahead of the bloc 's enlargement next year .
former french president valéry giscard d 'estaing handed over the proposed draft to the 15 current and 10 future member states .
the constitution – the first for the eu – was hammered out over the course of 16 months .
it sets out the guidelines for streamlining decision-making in a body that will soon grow to include many countries from formerly communist east europe .
while most of the controversial issues have been ironed out , a few eu governments are expected to raise some objections .
a good starting basis the blueprint was given near unanimous approval last week by the convention on the future of europe , which is headed by giscard and includes national and european parliamentarians as well as government and european commission representatives .
at friday ’ s session , the leaders were expected to endorse it in their final statement as " a good basis for starting " the inter-government conference -lrb- igc -rrb- talks on the final eu constitution in october .
as it stands now , the draft calls for the creation of a long-term european council president , which would replace the current 6-month rotating presidency , the establishment of an eu foreign minister , a slimmed-down commission , and the reduction of the right of national veto .
" the compromise that is included in mr. giscard ’ s proposal is a good compromise , " said summit host greek prime minister costas simitis , but added , in light of the anticipated discussion , " it is a compromise that can be further amended , improved , a different balance might be achieved in the text . "
giscard has urged eu leaders to change as little as possible .
but the greek summit is the first chance the leaders have to flag those points they will absolutely not accept in the final round of igc talks in october .
one of the main stumbling blocks is the inclusion of " qualified majority voting " provisions rather than the simple majority voting called for in the draft .
leaders from several smaller countries have signaled that they will seek to amend the draft in the final negotiations in order to preserve a weighted voting system that grants them power disproportionate to their population .
britain has also said it will push to retain veto power on issues of taxation and foreign policy .
and smaller eu countries have indicated they will oppose the full-time presidency out of fear that it would lead to domination by heavyweight states such as germany and france .
illegal immigration and asylum the opening day of the summit on thursday was dominated by the issue of illegal immigration and asylum .
a british proposal to set up what prime minister tony blair referred to as " zones of protection " for refugees near conflict areas to help stem the flow of asylum-seekers into europe met with little support from member states and hefty criticism from human rights groups .
only denmark and the netherlands seemed to even consider the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan peter balkenende " we support the idea of keeping people in the region they actually come from .
it would make it much easier for them to return home once the situation is safe for them again , " said jan-peter balkenende , the dutch prime minister .
although britain backed down from the controversial plans , eu leaders did agree that the european commission should examine ways to enhance protection for refugees in regions of conflict and in the first country that they seek asylum .
a report is expected to be presented on the issue by june of next year .
the decision over how many refugees any eu member will take in remains with the individual state , however , and is not likely to change any time soon .
eu leaders also agreed to invest 140 million euros -lrb- $ 163 million -rrb- in protecting the union ’ s borders against illegal immigrants .
within the next year , the eu ’ s frontier will expand east to touch the former soviet union and the balkans , porous border regions especially prone to the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
european security strategy the eu leaders on thursday also discussed foreign policy issues and their new commitment to fighting the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
in a draft statement , the leaders demanded that north korea dismantle its nuclear program and expressed concern over iran ’ s development of a nuclear program .
they urged tehran to accept spot checks on its atomic facilities in order to disperse assertions that it is developing illegal weapons .
on other issues , the eu leaders endorsed an embryonic european security strategy drawn up by eu foreign policy chief javier solana and they vowed to work actively alongside the united states in combating terrorism .
the leaders also reaffirmed their role of peace-negotiator in the middle east and said pressure needed to be applied to both israel and the palestinians in order to get peace talks underway .
protesters on the sidelines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters in greece outside the summit , police on friday fired tear gas and water cannons into a crowd of as many as 500 protestors , including anarchists , after they attempted to tear down the barricades leading into the hotel where the summit was being held .

five balkan countries hope to join the union within the next few years : albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro .
all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .
" we expect strong action on reforming state structures to eliminate the widespread curse of corruption " , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
" we expect energetic , totally firm action against organized crime " . saturday 's declaration states organized crime and corruption as the major obstacles for the balkans .
the region , which chris patten , the eu 's commissioner for external affairs , described as " one of the missing pieces in our jigsaw europe " , is europe 's poorest area and is still suffering from years of ethnic war in former yugoslavia . perspective , yes , exact dates , no at the summit , eu leaders stated the importance of encouraging the balkan countries to join the eu .
their future , they said , " is within the european union " . speaking on saturday , the german chancellor emphasized the necessity of giving the balkan states a perspective for membership .
europe 's boundaries were defined a long time ago , schröder said .
" one can not exclude ex-yugoslavia and the balkans from europe " . however , schröder refrained from naming an exact date for enlargement .
the process of democratization and the convergence of economic structures with the eu must be completed before membership could be obtained , schröder said . debate shifts outward the shift to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans comes after friday 's intense debate on the new draft european constitution . greece , which currently holds the rotating presidency , has been keen to make the union focus on the balkans – which lie between greece and most of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders believe that integrating the balkan states into the eu is the best way of stabilizing a region which is still suffering under the many years of ethnic strife in the 1990s and subsequent poverty , economic decline , crime and corruption . " the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit .

five balkan countries hope to join the union within the next few years : albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , serbia and montenegro .
all five are keen to join the european union , but face a long and hard climb to reaching their goal of full eu membership . " the speed of movement ahead lies in the hands of the countries of the region " , the eu and the five states said in a declaration issued at a western balkans summit in porto carras , greece , on saturday .
the meeting follows a two-day summit where eu leaders discussed issues from immigration to agriculture and decided on further steps towards a future european convention . heavy pressure to reform the eu have urged the balkan states to step up the fight against organized crime , speedup reform of finance and administration and increase co-operation with war crimes tribunals .
" we expect strong action on reforming state structures to eliminate the widespread curse of corruption " , italian foreign minister franco frattini said .
" we expect energetic , totally firm action against organized crime " . saturday 's declaration states organized crime and corruption as the major obstacles for the balkans .
the region , which chris patten , the eu 's commissioner for external affairs , described as " one of the missing pieces in our jigsaw europe " , is europe 's poorest area and is still suffering from years of ethnic war in former yugoslavia . perspective , yes , exact dates , no at the summit , eu leaders stated the importance of encouraging the balkan countries to join the eu .
their future , they said , " is within the european union " . speaking on saturday , the german chancellor emphasized the necessity of giving the balkan states a perspective for membership .
europe 's boundaries were defined a long time ago , schröder said .
" one can not exclude ex-yugoslavia and the balkans from europe " . however , schröder refrained from naming an exact date for enlargement .
the process of democratization and the convergence of economic structures with the eu must be completed before membership could be obtained , schröder said . debate shifts outward the shift to focusing on the european union 's near neighbors in the balkans comes after friday 's intense debate on the new draft european constitution . greece , which currently holds the rotating presidency , has been keen to make the union focus on the balkans – which lie between greece and most of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders believe that integrating the balkan states into the eu is the best way of stabilizing a region which is still suffering under the many years of ethnic strife in the 1990s and subsequent poverty , economic decline , crime and corruption . " the process of european unification will not be complete until the balkans have joined the eu " , european commission president romano prodi told a news conference . joining dates unclear despite saturday 's emphasis on eu-expansion to the balkans , it is still unclear exactly when the balkan states will be able to join . croatia and the new union of serbia and montenegro would like to join within the next five years . croatia , the most economically advanced of the five western balkan states is said to have a reasonable chance : along with macedonia it is the only balkan state to have negotiated a stabilization and association agreement with the eu – the first major step towards full membership .
however , croatia has been criticized for its reluctance to extradite suspected war criminals to the hague . the future of serbia and montenegro is also uncertain – its two constituent parts have yet to outline a clear working relationship .
in addition , the status of kosovo , which is still legally a province of serbia but de facto a united nations protectorate remains unresolved .
kosovo wants independence from belgrade but so far the international community has only supported autonomy for the province , fearing further fragmentation of the region . however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana said on saturday that serbia and kosovo had expressed readiness to begin its first direct talks by the end of july . aid bonus the eu plans to smooth the path to further enlargement with an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 237 million -rrb- in aid for the five western balkan states .
this comes in addition to the 4.6 billion euros already committed by the eu for the 2000-2006 period . speaking on saturday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said there was no need to fear further enlargement .
" of course it will be more complicated " , he said when the eu expands from its 15 members , but also that this step only emphasized the necessity of eu constitutional reform . the western-balkans summit sees the end of a three day discussion marathon , during which eu leaders concentrated on the issues of immigration and agriculture and decided on further steps towards the implementation of a future constitution for the eu . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders in greece for summit a compilation of dw-world articles relevent to the summit .

soon the unmistakable racing drumbeat of bhangra or punjabi pop explodes over the sound system .
the room is galvanized as the crowd swings into action , shaking their hips , swaying their hands and bobbing their heads to the infectious beats and raunchy punjabi lyrics .

the german success of the song didn ’ t just popularize bhangra – originally a folk dance and song performed during the harvest season in the north indian region of punjab and in recent decades mixed with reggae rhythms , hip-hop , r & b and garage influences by the punjabi diaspora in britain – but also helped the 32-year-old punjabi mc to fame in his native britain .

it ’ s still too early for the bollywood party to take off .
the strains of some indistinguishable oriental house music float around the spacious rooms as party-goers stand around , nurse their drinks and watch a choreographed dance sequence from an indian film unfold on a massive screen .
suddenly , the music stops and the dj switches tracks .
soon the unmistakable racing drumbeat of bhangra or punjabi pop explodes over the sound system .
the room is galvanized as the crowd swings into action , shaking their hips , swaying their hands and bobbing their heads to the infectious beats and raunchy punjabi lyrics .
the warm weather adds an authentic touch to the frenzied night , as berlin ’ s clubbers sweat it out till the early hours in temperatures comparable to bombay ’ s sizzling heat – the heartland of the bollywood wave rolling over berlin .

a regular fixture on the club scene in london and paris , the so-called bollywood trend , which includes a broad palette of bhangra or punjabi pop , indipop and remixed hindi film music infused with reggae , hip-hop and techno elements , has arrived in berlin .

regularly playing in clubs such as oxymoron in berlin ’ s trendy mitte district , gaba ’ s colorful parties include the screening of indian films replete with extravagant dance and song numbers and glamorously-clad film stars .
often djs are flown in from the subcontinent to play the latest bollywood numbers and bhangra pop from the indian charts .
" we wanted to get in a bit of modern indian lifestyle in our parties , which is basically defined by music , dance , fashion and film , " gaba told deutsche welle .

" mundian to bach ke " stormed its way to second place on the german charts last december and tenaciously stayed in the top ten for months after .
the german success of the song didn ’ t just popularize bhangra – originally a folk dance and song performed during the harvest season in the north indian region of punjab and in recent decades mixed with reggae rhythms , hip-hop , r & b and garage influences by the punjabi diaspora in britain – but also helped the 32-year-old punjabi mc to fame in his native britain .

the prince called on those who have criticised the prince of wales to give his father a break .
his interview with the press association came ahead of an african-themed party at windsor castle for 300 friends and family to celebrate his birthday on saturday .
the prince was interviewed and also posed for photographs by mario testino - the renowned celebrity photographer who famously took pictures of william 's mother diana .
' guiding principles ' speaking at st james 's palace , the prince - second in line to the throne - defended his father .
" he does so many amazing things , i only wish people would see that more because he 's had a very hard time and yet he 's stuck it out and he 's still very positive . "
" he 's very happy and protective towards harry and me as well , " he added .
the prince summed up his own personal goals as he embarks on adulthood . "
i think it 's very important that you make your own decision about what you are " prince william " my guiding principles in life are to be honest , genuine , thoughtful and caring , " he said .
the prince spoke with honesty and humour , mixing boyish charm with self-assured certainty .
" i 'm not an over-dominant person , " he said , " i do n't go around and expect everyone to listen to me the whole time .
" but i like to be in control of my life because i have so many people around me , i can get pulled in one direction and then the other .
" if i do n't have any say in it , then i end up just losing complete control and i do n't like the idea of that .
i could actually lose my identity . "
he defended his " stubborn " streak , which he said was a necessary attribute to his role .
" you have to be slightly stubborn because everybody wants you for one reason or another .
" if you do n't stick to your guns and stick to your decision , then you lose control . "
high office but william insisted he could still listen to advice , before making his own judgement . "
riding a motorbike can be dangerous , but so can lots of things " " i think it 's very important that you make your own decision about what you are .
" therefore you 're responsible for your actions , so you do n't blame other people . "
prince william is midway through a four-year history of art degree at st andrews university in scotland .
he steps into the role of counsellor of state with delegated powers to act on behalf of the queen .
in this he joins his father , the prince of wales , the duke of edinburgh , the duke of york and the earl of wessex .
in taking up the high office , he replaces the princess royal .
during the interview , the prince also talked about the influence on him of his mother princess diana , who died when he was just 15 .
he also talked of using his position as a royal to help others as she did .
" i was influenced by my visits to hostels with my mother when i was younger .
" i learned a lot from it , more so now than i did at the time . "
' common bond ' " my mother used her position very well to help other people , as does my father , and i hope to do the same , " he said .
and referring to his younger brother prince harry , 18 , he spoke of their " very good relationship " saying they will always share " that common bond " .
the prince talked also of his love of sport - he excels in water polo , swimming and rugby .
an aston villa football supporter , prince william also revealed his love of high-speed motorbike riding .
he admitted his father had concerns for his safety as he indulges his passion , but said : " it is a risk , but as long as you 've had sufficient and thorough training you should be okay . "
his other hobbies include music - with his tastes embracing the latest r & b acts .

the tunisian coast guard has already rescued 41 people and recovered 20 bodies , but rough seas have hampered the rescue operation .
survivors said the boat had been carrying about 250 people , believed to be from sub-saharan africa and northern africa .
it is at least the second boat to go down in the area this week .
as many as 70 were drowned when their boat sank off the tiny italian island of lampedusa on monday .
italian newspapers have described the stretch of water between africa and sicily as a huge underwater graveyard .
libya ' hub ' the cause of friday 's sinking is not known .
it may have been because the boat was overcrowded or in poor condition , or because of the bad weather - or a combination of all three .
a fishing boat raised the alarm at dawn on friday when its crew saw the sinking ship .
the tunisian national guard and navy responded , as did four civilian ships nearby and a pair of boats from offshore oil rigs in the area .
officials have not said where the boat came from but survivors say they boarded in libya , which is becoming a favourite spot of the ruthless immigrant-smuggling gangs , says the bbc 's frances kennedy in rome .
italy this week accused libya of being a base for boats trying to bring illegal immigrants across the mediterranean .
italy 's long coastline makes it a popular landfall for people seeking to enter europe illegally , with almost 3,000 believed to have landed in the country this month alone .
in the past week more than 1,000 migrants have arrived on lampedusa , which is closer to africa than to the italian mainland .
our correspondent says the reception centre there is full to bursting and residents are protesting as they fear that the immigrants will scare off tourists .
government crisis the second sea tragedy comes as italy adopts new , tougher measures to turn back boat loads of immigrants .
the surge in the number of boats , often barely seaworthy and dangerously overloaded , has prompted a crisis within the italian government coalition , our correspondent says .
the northern league is insisting on a tougher line , but suggestions that force be used to turn back the boats of immigrant smugglers have been dismissed outright by other ruling parties , our correspondent adds .
