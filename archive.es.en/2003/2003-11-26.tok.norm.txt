a palestinian who was born in jordan , abdallah was arrested along with nine other islamic extremists in april 2002 on suspicion of plotting imminent terrorist attacks in germany .
the 27-year-old was also charged with membership in a terrorist organization and falsifying passports .
abdallah testified that the al tawhid organization , which hoped to emulate al qaeda , had planned to attack the jewish museum or another target in berlin and two restaurants in düsseldorf .
he described al tawhid as a radical palestinian group dedicated to overthrowing the jordanian government and " fighting the jews . "
cooperation brought leniency in his closing statement last wednesday , abdallah expressed remorse for his actions .
" i accept that i am guilty and should be punished , " he said .
his lawyer , rüdiger deckers , had asked the court to take abdallah 's cooperation with authorities into consideration when handing down a sentence .
abdallah 's detailed testimony gave investigators insights into al tawhid as well as al qaeda and prosecutor dirk fernholz said the information had been " of outstanding importance , " but added that abdallah had bought hand grenades as well as a pistol with a silencer into germany to carry out attacks .
" one can hardly imagine the damage that could have resulted from the planned attacks , " fernholz said in his closing statements on nov .

" although he was uncertain at times about the meaning of his actions , he carried out preparations for the attacks until the end . "
terror training in afghanistan abdallah said he became associated with the al tawhid group , led by fugitive and fellow jordanian abu musab al-zarqawi , when he met the man in afghanistan in early 2000 .
abdallah testified he had gone to the country to attend an al qaeda terrorist training camp , where he learned how to handle weapons , poisons and explosives as well as received schooling in the logistics of terrorist attacks .
he said while there he served for two weeks as osama bin laden 's bodyguard .
in may 2001 he returned to germany and quickly became involved in terrorist cells in several german cities .
he told the court that it was shortly after the attacks on the pentagon and the world trade center that the german cell of al tawhid begin making plans for attacks on german soil .

tehran can expect censure from the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog - but not the threat washington hardliners had wanted . after a week of wrangling , european and u.s. diplomats agreed on a draft resolution regarding iran 's nuclear program , which will be submitted to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- governing council on wednesday in vienna .
the text condemns iran for hiding 18 years of atomic research but encourages its declared intentions to be honest and in cooperation with international nuclear regulators .
although agreed to , the resolution falls short of washington 's desire to threaten iran with the wrath of the u.n. security council , which could impose economic sanctions against tehran for further breaches of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
jury out on nuclear weapons a week ago the 35-nation nuclear watchdog had failed to decide what course to take against iran .
the dispute began after an iaea report had revealed that the tehran had violated international agreements by covering up its nuclear program for nearly two decades .
the nuclear regulators said they did not have evidence of a covert iranian atomic weapons program , but the jury was still out on whether iran was striving to develop nuclear arms .
britain , france and germany stood up against the united states , which insisted tehran should face u.n. security council sanctions for violating the npt .
the european " big three , " however , feared that sharp measures against iran would push the country to ditch concessions it had made to the europeans in october , which included permitting snap inspections and suspending uranium enrichment programs .
trigger clause the draft resolution text , which is expected to be passed without dissent by the iaea governing council , includes a so-called trigger clause to ensure that further iranian nuclear breaches are referred immediately to the body , which could then appeal to the u.n. security council .
" that 's an element that we wanted to see in the resolution , which points out that action will be forthcoming - appropriately so - if there is any indication in the future that iran is not meeting its obligations , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told reporters on tuesday .
" the most important fact is that the united states is failing step by step in forming a consensus against iran , " tehran 's envoy to the iaea , ali akbar saheli , said in the iranian qods newspaper , according to reuters .
he has said his country would accept a resolution that did n't directly mention the security council .

but what began as a coffee distribution company has grown to a billion euro firm that sells everything from bras , to digital radios and vacations .
since the fall of this year , tchibo has also begun offering credit-hungry german consumers credit at rates lower than most banks .
through a joint venture with the bank of scotland , which is apparently eager to enter into the german market , the company is offering interest rates of about 8.8 percent on its credit line .

" these fossilized nuts are the oldest proof we have for mammals laying in food stores , " martin sander , a paleontologist from bonn university told reuters .
" in fact they ’ re the oldest store of food yet known from any animal . "
sander ’ s colleague , carole gee , discovered the fossilized nuts in a lignite mine near the western town of garzweiler 10 years ago , but has only now gone public with the findings .
she said they were probably stored by a squirrel or hamster .
the nuts come from the chinquapin tree , which is no longer found in germany .
at the time the nuts were stored away during the miocene period , chinquapin trees as well as palm trees , crocodiles and apes were all common to western europe . more briefs 24.11.2003 -pipe- shevardnadze says he wants to stay in georgia 24.11.2003 -pipe- german president tours latin america 21.11.2003 -pipe- ecumenical memorial service for istanbul bombings victims 21.11.2003 -pipe- german interior minister : mention muslim heritage in eu constitution 21.11.2003 -pipe- jewish-americans ask schröder to deal with anti-semitism 21.11.2003 -pipe- trash scandal trial starts in cologne 19.11.2003 -pipe- schröder ends spd congress with support of party 19.11.2003 -pipe- mad cow disease found in brandenburg radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

tehran can expect censure from the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog - but not the threat washington hardliners had wanted . after a week of wrangling , european and u.s. diplomats agreed on a draft resolution regarding iran 's nuclear program , which will be submitted to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- governing council on wednesday in vienna .
the text condemns iran for hiding 18 years of atomic research but encourages its declared intentions to be honest and in cooperation with international nuclear regulators .
although agreed to , the resolution falls short of washington 's desire to threaten iran with the wrath of the u.n. security council , which could impose economic sanctions against tehran for further breaches of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
jury out on nuclear weapons a week ago the 35-nation nuclear watchdog had failed to decide what course to take against iran .
the dispute began after an iaea report had revealed that the tehran had violated international agreements by covering up its nuclear program for nearly two decades .
the nuclear regulators said they did not have evidence of a covert iranian atomic weapons program , but the jury was still out on whether iran was striving to develop nuclear arms .
britain , france and germany stood up against the united states , which insisted tehran should face u.n. security council sanctions for violating the npt .
the european " big three , " however , feared that sharp measures against iran would push the country to ditch concessions it had made to the europeans in october , which included permitting snap inspections and suspending uranium enrichment programs .
trigger clause the draft resolution text , which is expected to be passed without dissent by the iaea governing council , includes a so-called trigger clause to ensure that further iranian nuclear breaches are referred immediately to the body , which could then appeal to the u.n. security council .
" that 's an element that we wanted to see in the resolution , which points out that action will be forthcoming - appropriately so - if there is any indication in the future that iran is not meeting its obligations , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told reporters on tuesday .
" the most important fact is that the united states is failing step by step in forming a consensus against iran , " tehran 's envoy to the iaea , ali akbar saheli , said in the iranian qods newspaper , according to reuters .
he has said his country would accept a resolution that did n't directly mention the security council .

tehran can expect censure from the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog - but not the threat washington hardliners had wanted . after a week of wrangling , european and u.s. diplomats agreed on a draft resolution regarding iran 's nuclear program , which will be submitted to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- governing council on wednesday in vienna .
the text condemns iran for hiding 18 years of atomic research but encourages its declared intentions to be honest and in cooperation with international nuclear regulators .
although agreed to , the resolution falls short of washington 's desire to threaten iran with the wrath of the u.n. security council , which could impose economic sanctions against tehran for further breaches of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
jury out on nuclear weapons a week ago the 35-nation nuclear watchdog had failed to decide what course to take against iran .
the dispute began after an iaea report had revealed that the tehran had violated international agreements by covering up its nuclear program for nearly two decades .
the nuclear regulators said they did not have evidence of a covert iranian atomic weapons program , but the jury was still out on whether iran was striving to develop nuclear arms .
britain , france and germany stood up against the united states , which insisted tehran should face u.n. security council sanctions for violating the npt .
the european " big three , " however , feared that sharp measures against iran would push the country to ditch concessions it had made to the europeans in october , which included permitting snap inspections and suspending uranium enrichment programs .
trigger clause the draft resolution text , which is expected to be passed without dissent by the iaea governing council , includes a so-called trigger clause to ensure that further iranian nuclear breaches are referred immediately to the body , which could then appeal to the u.n. security council .
" that 's an element that we wanted to see in the resolution , which points out that action will be forthcoming - appropriately so - if there is any indication in the future that iran is not meeting its obligations , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told reporters on tuesday .
" the most important fact is that the united states is failing step by step in forming a consensus against iran , " tehran 's envoy to the iaea , ali akbar saheli , said in the iranian qods newspaper , according to reuters .
he has said his country would accept a resolution that did n't directly mention the security council .

tehran can expect censure from the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog - but not the threat washington hardliners had wanted . after a week of wrangling , european and u.s. diplomats agreed on a draft resolution regarding iran 's nuclear program , which will be submitted to the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- governing council on wednesday in vienna .
the text condemns iran for hiding 18 years of atomic research but encourages its declared intentions to be honest and in cooperation with international nuclear regulators .
although agreed to , the resolution falls short of washington 's desire to threaten iran with the wrath of the u.n. security council , which could impose economic sanctions against tehran for further breaches of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- .
jury out on nuclear weapons a week ago the 35-nation nuclear watchdog had failed to decide what course to take against iran .
the dispute began after an iaea report had revealed that the tehran had violated international agreements by covering up its nuclear program for nearly two decades .
the nuclear regulators said they did not have evidence of a covert iranian atomic weapons program , but the jury was still out on whether iran was striving to develop nuclear arms .
britain , france and germany stood up against the united states , which insisted tehran should face u.n. security council sanctions for violating the npt .
the european " big three , " however , feared that sharp measures against iran would push the country to ditch concessions it had made to the europeans in october , which included permitting snap inspections and suspending uranium enrichment programs .
trigger clause the draft resolution text , which is expected to be passed without dissent by the iaea governing council , includes a so-called trigger clause to ensure that further iranian nuclear breaches are referred immediately to the body , which could then appeal to the u.n. security council .
" that 's an element that we wanted to see in the resolution , which points out that action will be forthcoming - appropriately so - if there is any indication in the future that iran is not meeting its obligations , " u.s. secretary of state colin powell told reporters on tuesday .
" the most important fact is that the united states is failing step by step in forming a consensus against iran , " tehran 's envoy to the iaea , ali akbar saheli , said in the iranian qods newspaper , according to reuters .
he has said his country would accept a resolution that did n't directly mention the security council .

there are thought to be just 300 right whales left in the north-west atlantic .
atmospheric conditions above the ocean can affect zooplankton concentrations on which the whales depend for food , impacting their reproductive success .
the team developed a mathematical model to describe the relationship which it will report in the journal frontiers in ecology and the environment .
positive phase in late winter , north atlantic right whales -lrb- eubalaena glacialis -rrb- make their way to the gulf of maine , where they feed on its high concentrations of copepods - crustaceans about the size of rice grains .
eubalaena glacialis about 15 metres long 100 tonnes in weight 3 years between births the concentrations of one abundant copepod species , calanus finmarchicus , are linked to a pattern of atmospheric pressure called the north atlantic oscillation -lrb- nao -rrb- .
the nao is said to be in either a positive or a negative state .
when the nao has been in the positive state , the deep waters of the gulf of maine become warmer and saltier .
these conditions favour zooplankton , typically leading to higher abundances of these creatures .
following a period of negative nao conditions , the waters become colder and fresher - conditions that are less hospitable to zooplankton , leading to a fall in their numbers .
it takes about two years for these changes in the nao to affect zooplankton concentrations .
shifting pattern the researchers found that flips in nao and consequent fluctuations in abundances of zooplankton affected the birth rate of right whales .
andrew pershing of cornell university developed the " transitional probability " model . "
the bigger you are as a whale , the better you can get through pregnancy " dr robert d kenney , university of rhode island " we can explain about 65 % of the variability of right whale calving rates using this model , " said colleague professor charles greene , of cornell university , and lead author on forthcoming research papers on the subject .
a two-year period of physiological stress and poor reproduction in the whales between 1999 and 2000 can be traced to a dramatic negative flip in 1996 and a decline in copepod abundance in 1998 .
the nao has been in a predominantly positive phase since the 1970s .
but this may be changing .
" there are tantalising indications that we may be shifting towards a more negative phase -lsb- in the nao -rsb- , " said professor greene .
at the end of 2002 , there was a large negative shift in the nao .
the team have not yet analysed this data to see how it affected the zooplankton .
" but if there 's anything to this hypothesis , we would expect right whale calving to be adversely affected , " said co-author jack w jossi of the us national marine fisheries service -lrb- nmfs -rrb- .
on the brink mr jossi added that he expected to see adverse effects on zooplankton concentrations by winter 2004 .
" a female right whale needs to put on a lot of fat to give birth .
the bigger you are as a whale , the better you can get through pregnancy , " said dr robert d kenney , of the university of rhode island .
dr kenney said that drops in the concentrations of the zooplankton that right whales feed on may affect fertility in several ways .
firstly , the whales may need to achieve a certain level of fat in order to physiologically support a pregnancy .
secondly , when starved of food , they may not able to produce enough milk to support their calves - and the youngsters die .
thirdly , lack of food may cause an increase in miscarriages .
females have a minimum three-year period between pregnancies .
the most recent figures show that the population growth rate is -2.4 % per annum .
other researchers have predicted the extinction of the species in 200 years based on this current trend .
but professor greene said extinction could occur in a much shorter time if conditions worsen .
the whales have high mortality rates as well as their decreasing birth rates .
they frequently collide with ships and become entangled in fishing gear .

there are thought to be just 300 right whales left in the north-west atlantic .
atmospheric conditions above the ocean can affect zooplankton concentrations on which the whales depend for food , impacting their reproductive success .
the team developed a mathematical model to describe the relationship which it will report in the journal frontiers in ecology and the environment .
positive phase in late winter , north atlantic right whales -lrb- eubalaena glacialis -rrb- make their way to the gulf of maine , where they feed on its high concentrations of copepods - crustaceans about the size of rice grains .
eubalaena glacialis about 15 metres long 100 tonnes in weight 3 years between births the concentrations of one abundant copepod species , calanus finmarchicus , are linked to a pattern of atmospheric pressure called the north atlantic oscillation -lrb- nao -rrb- .
the nao is said to be in either a positive or a negative state .
when the nao has been in the positive state , the deep waters of the gulf of maine become warmer and saltier .
these conditions favour zooplankton , typically leading to higher abundances of these creatures .
following a period of negative nao conditions , the waters become colder and fresher - conditions that are less hospitable to zooplankton , leading to a fall in their numbers .
it takes about two years for these changes in the nao to affect zooplankton concentrations .
shifting pattern the researchers found that flips in nao and consequent fluctuations in abundances of zooplankton affected the birth rate of right whales .
andrew pershing of cornell university developed the " transitional probability " model .
the bigger you are as a whale , the better you can get through pregnancy dr robert d kenney , university of rhode island " we can explain about 65 % of the variability of right whale calving rates using this model , " said colleague professor charles greene , of cornell university , and lead author on forthcoming research papers on the subject .
a two-year period of physiological stress and poor reproduction in the whales between 1999 and 2000 can be traced to a dramatic negative flip in 1996 and a decline in copepod abundance in 1998 .
the nao has been in a predominantly positive phase since the 1970s .
but this may be changing .
" there are tantalising indications that we may be shifting towards a more negative phase -lsb- in the nao -rsb- , " said professor greene .
at the end of 2002 , there was a large negative shift in the nao .
the team have not yet analysed this data to see how it affected the zooplankton .
" but if there 's anything to this hypothesis , we would expect right whale calving to be adversely affected , " said co-author jack w jossi of the us national marine fisheries service -lrb- nmfs -rrb- .
on the brink mr jossi added that he expected to see adverse effects on zooplankton concentrations by winter 2004 .
" a female right whale needs to put on a lot of fat to give birth .
the bigger you are as a whale , the better you can get through pregnancy , " said dr robert d kenney , of the university of rhode island .
the whales are frequently involved in collisions with ships dr kenney said that drops in the concentrations of the zooplankton that right whales feed on may affect fertility in several ways .
firstly , the whales may need to achieve a certain level of fat in order to physiologically support a pregnancy .
secondly , when starved of food , they may not able to produce enough milk to support their calves - and the youngsters die .
thirdly , lack of food may cause an increase in miscarriages .
females have a minimum three-year period between pregnancies .
the most recent figures show that the population growth rate is -2.4 % per annum .
other researchers have predicted the extinction of the species in 200 years based on this current trend .
but professor greene said extinction could occur in a much shorter time if conditions worsen .
the whales have high mortality rates as well as their decreasing birth rates .
they frequently collide with ships and become entangled in fishing gear .

the board of the south devon healthcare trust is being told on wednesday that savings need to be made at torbay hospital between now and the end of the year .
trust chief executive tony parr says they have been in similar positions before and have always managed to break even .
on tuesday , the trust was named in a list of 32 health organisations selected to become foundation trusts in october .
independent organisation tony parr said : " this year the position is somewhat tighter than it has been in the past .
" there is an awful lot of demand for our services and our emergency admissions are considerably up from what we had planned .
" that costs money and other resources in order to deal with that . "
the announcement the trust is to be in the next round of hospitals to become foundations , came just days after the controversial government policy to give top-rated hospitals more freedom scraped through parliament .
borrow money under the proposals , hospitals can become independent not-for-profit organisations .
they will be able to borrow money on the private market and have a greater control over their own affairs .
mr parr said getting foundation status would have major benefits .
he said : " basically , it frees up the hospital as it is currently managed , to being managed in directly from the department of health .
" it get rids of a level of bureaucracy and allows local people to be elected to the hospital 's governing body . "

the board of the south devon healthcare trust is being told on wednesday that savings need to be made at torbay hospital between now and the end of the year .
trust chief executive tony parr says they have been in similar positions before and have always managed to break even .
on tuesday , the trust was named in a list of 32 health organisations selected to become foundation trusts in october .
independent organisation tony parr said : " this year the position is somewhat tighter than it has been in the past .
" there is an awful lot of demand for our services and our emergency admissions are considerably up from what we had planned .
" that costs money and other resources in order to deal with that . "
the announcement the trust is to be in the next round of hospitals to become foundations , came just days after the controversial government policy to give top-rated hospitals more freedom scraped through parliament .
borrow money under the proposals , hospitals can become independent not-for-profit organisations .
they will be able to borrow money on the private market and have a greater control over their own affairs .
mr parr said getting foundation status would have major benefits .

people who inherit faulty brca genes are at increased risk of developing either form of cancer but the new gene , emsy , appears to shut down a form of fully-functioning brca - increasing risk in those not normally thought to be vulnerable .
the research , by cambridge university for cancer research uk , will be published in the journal cell .
it should help us in the development of new , targeted treatments against breast and ovarian cancer .
professor carlos caldas scientists hope it will lead to new tests to predict the development of both breast and ovarian cancer .
lead researcher professor tony kouzarides , said : " discovering such an important new gene is very exciting and gives us the piece in the jigsaw we 've been looking for .
" we 'll now have a much more sophisticated image of the genetic changes triggering breast and ovarian cancer in women who have n't inherited a high risk of cancer , but develop it anyway .
" it 's going to give us new lines of investigation and potentially exciting angles of attack . "
genetic inheritance inheriting faulty brca genes gives women a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer - but only 5 % of breast cancers run in families like this .
scientists have been hunting for the genes that cause sporadic breast cancers - the other 95 % of cases - ever since the brca genes were discovered , eight years ago .
they had long suspected brca2 might play a role in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers - despite the fact that the gene is very rarely damaged within these tumours .
professor kouzarides ' team found emsy has a role in turning genes on and off and in repairing damaged dna .
it is particularly effective at switching off brca2 .
tests on hundreds of tumour samples revealed that 13 % of breast cancers , and 17 % of ovarian cancers contained extra copies of the gene .
however , it was never found in normal tissue - and hardly ever in other types of tumour .
professor carlos caldas , who also worked on the study , said : " we 've always thought factors that are important in inherited breast cancers should also be playing a role in other kinds and it 's heartening to know that we had n't been barking up the wrong tree .
" it should help us in the development of new , targeted treatments against breast and ovarian cancer , particularly as cancers with high levels of the new gene seem to behave in a similar way to inherited forms .
" emsy could also form the basis for new types of predictive test . "
aggressive disease emsy seems to play a particularly important role in aggressive forms of breast cancer .
women whose tumours had extra copies of the emsy gene survived for 6.4 years on average , compared with 14 years for those whose breast cancers had normal amounts of emsy .
the difference in survival was particularly great among women who at diagnosis had not suffered any spread of the cancer to their lymph nodes .
this suggests it might be possible to test for emsy early on in a woman 's course of treatment , in order to predict how aggressive their disease is likely to become .

people who inherit faulty brca genes are at increased risk of developing either form of cancer but the new gene , emsy , appears to shut down a form of fully-functioning brca - increasing risk in those not normally thought to be vulnerable .
the research , by cambridge university for cancer research uk , will be published in the journal cell .
it should help us in the development of new , targeted treatments against breast and ovarian cancer .
professor carlos caldas scientists hope it will lead to new tests to predict the development of both breast and ovarian cancer .
lead researcher professor tony kouzarides , said : " discovering such an important new gene is very exciting and gives us the piece in the jigsaw we 've been looking for .
" we 'll now have a much more sophisticated image of the genetic changes triggering breast and ovarian cancer in women who have n't inherited a high risk of cancer , but develop it anyway .
" it 's going to give us new lines of investigation and potentially exciting angles of attack . "
genetic inheritance inheriting faulty brca genes gives women a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer - but only 5 % of breast cancers run in families like this .
scientists have been hunting for the genes that cause sporadic breast cancers - the other 95 % of cases - ever since the brca genes were discovered , eight years ago .
they had long suspected brca2 might play a role in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers - despite the fact that the gene is very rarely damaged within these tumours .
professor kouzarides ' team found emsy has a role in turning genes on and off and in repairing damaged dna .
it is particularly effective at switching off brca2 .
tests on hundreds of tumour samples revealed that 13 % of breast cancers , and 17 % of ovarian cancers contained extra copies of the gene .
however , it was never found in normal tissue - and hardly ever in other types of tumour .
professor carlos caldas , who also worked on the study , said : " we 've always thought factors that are important in inherited breast cancers should also be playing a role in other kinds and it 's heartening to know that we had n't been barking up the wrong tree .
" it should help us in the development of new , targeted treatments against breast and ovarian cancer , particularly as cancers with high levels of the new gene seem to behave in a similar way to inherited forms .
" emsy could also form the basis for new types of predictive test . "
aggressive disease emsy seems to play a particularly important role in aggressive forms of breast cancer .
women whose tumours had extra copies of the emsy gene survived for 6.4 years on average , compared with 14 years for those whose breast cancers had normal amounts of emsy .
the difference in survival was particularly great among women who at diagnosis had not suffered any spread of the cancer to their lymph nodes .
this suggests it might be possible to test for emsy early on in a woman 's course of treatment , in order to predict how aggressive their disease is likely to become .

a conference in newport has heard that wales ' 24,000 call centre workforce is one of the best in the uk and earns £ 400m per annum .
consumer call centres have provided huge numbers of jobs in wales but , in recent months , more and more companies have said they will be employing people in countries like india to run their operations .
the message from the conference is that wales can stand up to this migration of jobs .
research by incomes data services has found that the welsh call centre workforce has the lowest staff turnover rate in britain and is only half of that in india .
the chief executive of national rail enquiries , which employs several hundred at its cardiff call centre , said earlier this month that indian call centre workers were better educated and did a better job than those in britain .
he added that moving operations abroad would save £ 25m over several years .
important industry delegates at the conference debated the potential effects of " outsourcing " on the contact centre industry and the strategies that could be implemented in the sector for future growth .
there are over 130 employers operating in 29 towns throughout wales .
average salaries at all levels in the call centre sector are above the welsh average , but remain competitive against other uk regions .

a conference in newport has heard that wales ' 24,000 call centre workforce is one of the best in the uk and earns £ 400m per annum .
consumer call centres have provided huge numbers of jobs in wales but , in recent months , more and more companies have said they will be employing people in countries like india to run their operations .
the message from the conference is that wales can stand up to this migration of jobs .
research by incomes data services has found that the welsh call centre workforce has the lowest staff turnover rate in britain and is only half of that in india .
the chief executive of national rail enquiries , which employs several hundred at its cardiff call centre , said earlier this month that indian call centre workers were better educated and did a better job than those in britain .
he added that moving operations abroad would save £ 25m over several years .
important industry delegates at the conference debated the potential effects of " outsourcing " on the contact centre industry and the strategies that could be implemented in the sector for future growth .
there are over 130 employers operating in 29 towns throughout wales .
average salaries at all levels in the call centre sector are above the welsh average , but remain competitive against other uk regions .

scotland yard said reports of muggings rose from the average rate of 150 a day to 180 over the three days .
hundreds of police officers were moved from their regular work to help provide security for the visit .
more than 5,000 officers were on duty on the day of the protest march when more than 100,000 people demonstrated through the heart of the city .
scotland yard said the worst affected boroughs were hammersmith , hackney , islington , newham and lambeth .
a spokesman said the trend may continue for a week after the visit because of officers ' shifts being rescheduled and because of the time lag on investigating the alleged crimes .
commander john yates told the times there was no evidence of a rise in crimes such as burglary or car crime .
" street crime is the one that benefits from high-visibility policing and good covert tactics .
" it 's not a dramatic effect but we have seen it every time we have a major event in the capital . "
