israel 's announcement that it would " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat has met with international criticism everywhere from the u.s. state department to the office of french president jacques chirac . following the announcement thursday evening by the israeli cabinet , german foreign minister joschka fischer , a sometime middle east peace negotiator , embarked on a marathon of phone calls with other european leaders . the consensus was unanimous : the israeli cabinet 's decision to " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat " in a manner that will be determined separately , " would only escalate the israeli-palestinian conflict , which had just endured a bloody few days . " the decision is not appropriate for stabilizing the dangerous situation in the middle east , " said a spokesman for germany 's foreign ministry . france , which considers arafat the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , and the european union issued similar statements and a state department official told reuters that removal would only give arafat an " international stage on which he would continue to be an obstacle to peace .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .

it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .

märz 2002 in triest berlusconi ’ s debut as eu head earned a notorious reputation with the by now infamous nazi comparison that created a rift with berlin .
it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .
" i ’ m sure of myself .
i ’ ve never been down because of the criticism that seems to be unfounded , in my opinion , " italian news agency agi quoted berlusconi as saying this week .
" i have fun seeing people ’ s reactions , and will continue to be myself . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de basta !

germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .
those growth figures , however , only hold if employees work more hours for the same pay . get to work ! leading politicians of various stripes are advocating longer hours .
earlier this summer , wolfgang clement , the economics minister , set off a small firestorm when he suggested germans drop one of their holidays to help spur economic growth . " as far as vacations , holidays and work hours go , we 've reached the limit , " he said . the head of germany 's conservative christian democrats , angela merkel , also weighed in , suggesting that working hours in western germany , which are generally shorter than those in the eastern part of the country , should be lengthened . " we are going to have to work longer again if we are going to keep up with other countries , " the cdu leader told the tabloid newspaper , bild . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's liberal party , said working more hours a week was preferable to having to wait until the age of 67 or 70 to retire , which could become a reality given the state of germany 's pension system . " we will not be able to maintain our current level of prosperity with less work , only with more , " he said . holiday history germany 's leisure habits are rooted in the country 's " economic miracle " years of the 1950s through the 1970s , when the country rebuilt its industries from the wreckage of world war two and became an export powerhouse .
at that time , germans worked more than americans . but as growth slowed in the 1980s and unemployment grew , unions bargained for more vacation days and shorter hours based on the theory that cutting hours per worker gave more workers a chance at a job . unions say no unions have reacted angrily to the suggestion of a longer work week , accusing employers of using the debate as a cover to lower wages across the board .
labor leaders say lengthening the work week would only increase unemployment , which is already near record highs in germany , and upset germany 's delicate balance between the rights of employees and employers . " we work less in germany but have a higher level of productivity , " said dierk hirschel , an economist at the german federation of trade unions .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .

märz 2002 in triest berlusconi ’ s debut as eu head earned a notorious reputation with the by now infamous nazi comparison that created a rift with berlin .
it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .
" i ’ m sure of myself .
i ’ ve never been down because of the criticism that seems to be unfounded , in my opinion , " italian news agency agi quoted berlusconi as saying this week .

israel 's announcement that it would " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat has met with international criticism everywhere from the u.s. state department to the office of french president jacques chirac . following the announcement thursday evening by the israeli cabinet , german foreign minister joschka fischer , a sometime middle east peace negotiator , embarked on a marathon of phone calls with other european leaders . the consensus was unanimous : the israeli cabinet 's decision to " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat " in a manner that will be determined separately , " would only escalate the israeli-palestinian conflict , which had just endured a bloody few days . " the decision is not appropriate for stabilizing the dangerous situation in the middle east , " said a spokesman for germany 's foreign ministry . france , which considers arafat the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , and the european union issued similar statements and a state department official told reuters that removal would only give arafat an " international stage on which he would continue to be an obstacle to peace . " describing any decision to expel arafat as a " terrible mistake , " european commission spokesman diego de ojeda said : " nothing has changed from our point of view .
mr arafat remains the democratically elected president of the palestinian authority and as such we shall continue with our contacts with the palestinian authority at all levels depending on circumstances . " palestinians swarm arafat headquarters arafat emerged from his headquarters in the west bank city of ramallah thursday evening to cheers as thousands of supporters promised to defend him .
a resolute arafat said he was not going to go anywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orly , the mother of israeli soldier mazi grego , cries during her funeral in the city of hulon near tel aviv , wednesday sept 10 2003 .

-lrb- ap photo / eitan hess-ashkenazi -rrb- the israeli reached the cabinet decision after two days of suicide bombings that left 15 israelis dead .
the government of prime minister ariel sharon had declared arafat " irrelevant " in december 2001 , and refused to negotiate with him .
under pressure from the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations , arafat stepped down this summer to help get the quartet 's " roadmap " to peace on its way .
mahmoud abbas was appointed prime minister but resigned saturday recently after escalating violence between the two sides derailed the roadmap once again . killing arafat discussed , reports say arafat-favorite ahmed qurie was designated prime minister in abbas ' place .
he responded to the israeli announcement by suspending the selection of his cabinet .
if implemented , he said , the decision would not just " blow up the palestinian territories , but also the entire region . " it was not clear what the cabinet met by " removal . "
reports speculated that the term could also mean killing arafat - a move sharon is said to be against .
middle east observers said eliminating arafat would be fruitless .

israel 's announcement that it would " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat has met with international criticism everywhere from the u.s. state department to the office of french president jacques chirac . following the announcement thursday evening by the israeli cabinet , german foreign minister joschka fischer , a sometime middle east peace negotiator , embarked on a marathon of phone calls with other european leaders . the consensus was unanimous : the israeli cabinet 's decision to " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat " in a manner that will be determined separately , " would only escalate the israeli-palestinian conflict , which had just endured a bloody few days .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .

it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .

the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.09.2003 could longer work hours revive the german economy ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working longer could create more jobs , some economists say .
germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .
those growth figures , however , only hold if employees work more hours for the same pay . get to work ! leading politicians of various stripes are advocating longer hours .
earlier this summer , wolfgang clement , the economics minister , set off a small firestorm when he suggested germans drop one of their holidays to help spur economic growth .

i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .
those growth figures , however , only hold if employees work more hours for the same pay . get to work ! leading politicians of various stripes are advocating longer hours .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .

märz 2002 in triest berlusconi ’ s debut as eu head earned a notorious reputation with the by now infamous nazi comparison that created a rift with berlin .
it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .
" i ’ m sure of myself .
i ’ ve never been down because of the criticism that seems to be unfounded , in my opinion , " italian news agency agi quoted berlusconi as saying this week .

israel 's announcement that it would " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat has met with international criticism everywhere from the u.s. state department to the office of french president jacques chirac . following the announcement thursday evening by the israeli cabinet , german foreign minister joschka fischer , a sometime middle east peace negotiator , embarked on a marathon of phone calls with other european leaders . the consensus was unanimous : the israeli cabinet 's decision to " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat " in a manner that will be determined separately , " would only escalate the israeli-palestinian conflict , which had just endured a bloody few days . " the decision is not appropriate for stabilizing the dangerous situation in the middle east , " said a spokesman for germany 's foreign ministry . france , which considers arafat the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , and the european union issued similar statements and a state department official told reuters that removal would only give arafat an " international stage on which he would continue to be an obstacle to peace . " describing any decision to expel arafat as a " terrible mistake , " european commission spokesman diego de ojeda said : " nothing has changed from our point of view .
mr arafat remains the democratically elected president of the palestinian authority and as such we shall continue with our contacts with the palestinian authority at all levels depending on circumstances . " palestinians swarm arafat headquarters arafat emerged from his headquarters in the west bank city of ramallah thursday evening to cheers as thousands of supporters promised to defend him .
a resolute arafat said he was not going to go anywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orly , the mother of israeli soldier mazi grego , cries during her funeral in the city of hulon near tel aviv , wednesday sept 10 2003 .
grego was killed as a palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up tuesday killing eight people in the central israeli town of rishon letzion .
-lrb- ap photo / eitan hess-ashkenazi -rrb- the israeli reached the cabinet decision after two days of suicide bombings that left 15 israelis dead .
the government of prime minister ariel sharon had declared arafat " irrelevant " in december 2001 , and refused to negotiate with him .
under pressure from the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations , arafat stepped down this summer to help get the quartet 's " roadmap " to peace on its way .
mahmoud abbas was appointed prime minister but resigned saturday recently after escalating violence between the two sides derailed the roadmap once again . killing arafat discussed , reports say arafat-favorite ahmed qurie was designated prime minister in abbas ' place .
he responded to the israeli announcement by suspending the selection of his cabinet .
if implemented , he said , the decision would not just " blow up the palestinian territories , but also the entire region . " it was not clear what the cabinet met by " removal . "
reports speculated that the term could also mean killing arafat - a move sharon is said to be against .
middle east observers said eliminating arafat would be fruitless .

israel 's announcement that it would " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat has met with international criticism everywhere from the u.s. state department to the office of french president jacques chirac . following the announcement thursday evening by the israeli cabinet , german foreign minister joschka fischer , a sometime middle east peace negotiator , embarked on a marathon of phone calls with other european leaders . the consensus was unanimous : the israeli cabinet 's decision to " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat " in a manner that will be determined separately , " would only escalate the israeli-palestinian conflict , which had just endured a bloody few days . " the decision is not appropriate for stabilizing the dangerous situation in the middle east , " said a spokesman for germany 's foreign ministry . france , which considers arafat the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , and the european union issued similar statements and a state department official told reuters that removal would only give arafat an " international stage on which he would continue to be an obstacle to peace . " describing any decision to expel arafat as a " terrible mistake , " european commission spokesman diego de ojeda said : " nothing has changed from our point of view .

germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .
those growth figures , however , only hold if employees work more hours for the same pay . get to work ! leading politicians of various stripes are advocating longer hours .
earlier this summer , wolfgang clement , the economics minister , set off a small firestorm when he suggested germans drop one of their holidays to help spur economic growth . " as far as vacations , holidays and work hours go , we 've reached the limit , " he said . the head of germany 's conservative christian democrats , angela merkel , also weighed in , suggesting that working hours in western germany , which are generally shorter than those in the eastern part of the country , should be lengthened . " we are going to have to work longer again if we are going to keep up with other countries , " the cdu leader told the tabloid newspaper , bild . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's liberal party , said working more hours a week was preferable to having to wait until the age of 67 or 70 to retire , which could become a reality given the state of germany 's pension system . " we will not be able to maintain our current level of prosperity with less work , only with more , " he said . holiday history germany 's leisure habits are rooted in the country 's " economic miracle " years of the 1950s through the 1970s , when the country rebuilt its industries from the wreckage of world war two and became an export powerhouse .
at that time , germans worked more than americans . but as growth slowed in the 1980s and unemployment grew , unions bargained for more vacation days and shorter hours based on the theory that cutting hours per worker gave more workers a chance at a job . unions say no unions have reacted angrily to the suggestion of a longer work week , accusing employers of using the debate as a cover to lower wages across the board .
labor leaders say lengthening the work week would only increase unemployment , which is already near record highs in germany , and upset germany 's delicate balance between the rights of employees and employers . " we work less in germany but have a higher level of productivity , " said dierk hirschel , an economist at the german federation of trade unions .
" we can produce more per hour because people are relaxed since they do n't have to work as much as in other countries . " he would like to see a 35 hour week become the norm . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to amusement park deutschland ?

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und der italienische ministerpräsident silvio berlusconi bei ihrem treffen am 8 .
märz 2002 in triest berlusconi ’ s debut as eu head earned a notorious reputation with the by now infamous nazi comparison that created a rift with berlin .
it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .
" i ’ m sure of myself .
i ’ ve never been down because of the criticism that seems to be unfounded , in my opinion , " italian news agency agi quoted berlusconi as saying this week .

germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .
those growth figures , however , only hold if employees work more hours for the same pay . get to work ! leading politicians of various stripes are advocating longer hours .
earlier this summer , wolfgang clement , the economics minister , set off a small firestorm when he suggested germans drop one of their holidays to help spur economic growth . " as far as vacations , holidays and work hours go , we 've reached the limit , " he said . the head of germany 's conservative christian democrats , angela merkel , also weighed in , suggesting that working hours in western germany , which are generally shorter than those in the eastern part of the country , should be lengthened . " we are going to have to work longer again if we are going to keep up with other countries , " the cdu leader told the tabloid newspaper , bild . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's liberal party , said working more hours a week was preferable to having to wait until the age of 67 or 70 to retire , which could become a reality given the state of germany 's pension system . " we will not be able to maintain our current level of prosperity with less work , only with more , " he said . holiday history germany 's leisure habits are rooted in the country 's " economic miracle " years of the 1950s through the 1970s , when the country rebuilt its industries from the wreckage of world war two and became an export powerhouse .
at that time , germans worked more than americans . but as growth slowed in the 1980s and unemployment grew , unions bargained for more vacation days and shorter hours based on the theory that cutting hours per worker gave more workers a chance at a job . unions say no unions have reacted angrily to the suggestion of a longer work week , accusing employers of using the debate as a cover to lower wages across the board .
labor leaders say lengthening the work week would only increase unemployment , which is already near record highs in germany , and upset germany 's delicate balance between the rights of employees and employers . " we work less in germany but have a higher level of productivity , " said dierk hirschel , an economist at the german federation of trade unions .

israel 's announcement that it would " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat has met with international criticism everywhere from the u.s. state department to the office of french president jacques chirac . following the announcement thursday evening by the israeli cabinet , german foreign minister joschka fischer , a sometime middle east peace negotiator , embarked on a marathon of phone calls with other european leaders . the consensus was unanimous : the israeli cabinet 's decision to " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat " in a manner that will be determined separately , " would only escalate the israeli-palestinian conflict , which had just endured a bloody few days . " the decision is not appropriate for stabilizing the dangerous situation in the middle east , " said a spokesman for germany 's foreign ministry . france , which considers arafat the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , and the european union issued similar statements and a state department official told reuters that removal would only give arafat an " international stage on which he would continue to be an obstacle to peace . " describing any decision to expel arafat as a " terrible mistake , " european commission spokesman diego de ojeda said : " nothing has changed from our point of view .
mr arafat remains the democratically elected president of the palestinian authority and as such we shall continue with our contacts with the palestinian authority at all levels depending on circumstances . " palestinians swarm arafat headquarters arafat emerged from his headquarters in the west bank city of ramallah thursday evening to cheers as thousands of supporters promised to defend him .

-lrb- ap photo / eitan hess-ashkenazi -rrb- the israeli reached the cabinet decision after two days of suicide bombings that left 15 israelis dead .
the government of prime minister ariel sharon had declared arafat " irrelevant " in december 2001 , and refused to negotiate with him .
under pressure from the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations , arafat stepped down this summer to help get the quartet 's " roadmap " to peace on its way .
mahmoud abbas was appointed prime minister but resigned saturday recently after escalating violence between the two sides derailed the roadmap once again . killing arafat discussed , reports say arafat-favorite ahmed qurie was designated prime minister in abbas ' place .
he responded to the israeli announcement by suspending the selection of his cabinet .
if implemented , he said , the decision would not just " blow up the palestinian territories , but also the entire region . " it was not clear what the cabinet met by " removal . "
reports speculated that the term could also mean killing arafat - a move sharon is said to be against .
middle east observers said eliminating arafat would be fruitless .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .

märz 2002 in triest berlusconi ’ s debut as eu head earned a notorious reputation with the by now infamous nazi comparison that created a rift with berlin .
it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .
" i ’ m sure of myself .
i ’ ve never been down because of the criticism that seems to be unfounded , in my opinion , " italian news agency agi quoted berlusconi as saying this week .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.09.2003 could longer work hours revive the german economy ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working longer could create more jobs , some economists say .
germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .

germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .

germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .
those growth figures , however , only hold if employees work more hours for the same pay . get to work ! leading politicians of various stripes are advocating longer hours .
earlier this summer , wolfgang clement , the economics minister , set off a small firestorm when he suggested germans drop one of their holidays to help spur economic growth . " as far as vacations , holidays and work hours go , we 've reached the limit , " he said . the head of germany 's conservative christian democrats , angela merkel , also weighed in , suggesting that working hours in western germany , which are generally shorter than those in the eastern part of the country , should be lengthened . " we are going to have to work longer again if we are going to keep up with other countries , " the cdu leader told the tabloid newspaper , bild . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's liberal party , said working more hours a week was preferable to having to wait until the age of 67 or 70 to retire , which could become a reality given the state of germany 's pension system . " we will not be able to maintain our current level of prosperity with less work , only with more , " he said . holiday history germany 's leisure habits are rooted in the country 's " economic miracle " years of the 1950s through the 1970s , when the country rebuilt its industries from the wreckage of world war two and became an export powerhouse .
at that time , germans worked more than americans . but as growth slowed in the 1980s and unemployment grew , unions bargained for more vacation days and shorter hours based on the theory that cutting hours per worker gave more workers a chance at a job . unions say no unions have reacted angrily to the suggestion of a longer work week , accusing employers of using the debate as a cover to lower wages across the board .
labor leaders say lengthening the work week would only increase unemployment , which is already near record highs in germany , and upset germany 's delicate balance between the rights of employees and employers . " we work less in germany but have a higher level of productivity , " said dierk hirschel , an economist at the german federation of trade unions .
" we can produce more per hour because people are relaxed since they do n't have to work as much as in other countries . " he would like to see a 35 hour week become the norm . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to amusement park deutschland ?

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und der italienische ministerpräsident silvio berlusconi bei ihrem treffen am 8 .
märz 2002 in triest berlusconi ’ s debut as eu head earned a notorious reputation with the by now infamous nazi comparison that created a rift with berlin .
it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .
" i ’ m sure of myself .
i ’ ve never been down because of the criticism that seems to be unfounded , in my opinion , " italian news agency agi quoted berlusconi as saying this week .

germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .
those growth figures , however , only hold if employees work more hours for the same pay . get to work ! leading politicians of various stripes are advocating longer hours .
earlier this summer , wolfgang clement , the economics minister , set off a small firestorm when he suggested germans drop one of their holidays to help spur economic growth . " as far as vacations , holidays and work hours go , we 've reached the limit , " he said . the head of germany 's conservative christian democrats , angela merkel , also weighed in , suggesting that working hours in western germany , which are generally shorter than those in the eastern part of the country , should be lengthened . " we are going to have to work longer again if we are going to keep up with other countries , " the cdu leader told the tabloid newspaper , bild . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's liberal party , said working more hours a week was preferable to having to wait until the age of 67 or 70 to retire , which could become a reality given the state of germany 's pension system . " we will not be able to maintain our current level of prosperity with less work , only with more , " he said . holiday history germany 's leisure habits are rooted in the country 's " economic miracle " years of the 1950s through the 1970s , when the country rebuilt its industries from the wreckage of world war two and became an export powerhouse .
at that time , germans worked more than americans . but as growth slowed in the 1980s and unemployment grew , unions bargained for more vacation days and shorter hours based on the theory that cutting hours per worker gave more workers a chance at a job . unions say no unions have reacted angrily to the suggestion of a longer work week , accusing employers of using the debate as a cover to lower wages across the board .
labor leaders say lengthening the work week would only increase unemployment , which is already near record highs in germany , and upset germany 's delicate balance between the rights of employees and employers . " we work less in germany but have a higher level of productivity , " said dierk hirschel , an economist at the german federation of trade unions .

germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .
those growth figures , however , only hold if employees work more hours for the same pay . get to work ! leading politicians of various stripes are advocating longer hours .
earlier this summer , wolfgang clement , the economics minister , set off a small firestorm when he suggested germans drop one of their holidays to help spur economic growth . " as far as vacations , holidays and work hours go , we 've reached the limit , " he said . the head of germany 's conservative christian democrats , angela merkel , also weighed in , suggesting that working hours in western germany , which are generally shorter than those in the eastern part of the country , should be lengthened . " we are going to have to work longer again if we are going to keep up with other countries , " the cdu leader told the tabloid newspaper , bild . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's liberal party , said working more hours a week was preferable to having to wait until the age of 67 or 70 to retire , which could become a reality given the state of germany 's pension system . " we will not be able to maintain our current level of prosperity with less work , only with more , " he said . holiday history germany 's leisure habits are rooted in the country 's " economic miracle " years of the 1950s through the 1970s , when the country rebuilt its industries from the wreckage of world war two and became an export powerhouse .
at that time , germans worked more than americans . but as growth slowed in the 1980s and unemployment grew , unions bargained for more vacation days and shorter hours based on the theory that cutting hours per worker gave more workers a chance at a job . unions say no unions have reacted angrily to the suggestion of a longer work week , accusing employers of using the debate as a cover to lower wages across the board .
labor leaders say lengthening the work week would only increase unemployment , which is already near record highs in germany , and upset germany 's delicate balance between the rights of employees and employers . " we work less in germany but have a higher level of productivity , " said dierk hirschel , an economist at the german federation of trade unions .
" we can produce more per hour because people are relaxed since they do n't have to work as much as in other countries . " he would like to see a 35 hour week become the norm . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to amusement park deutschland ?

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .

märz 2002 in triest berlusconi ’ s debut as eu head earned a notorious reputation with the by now infamous nazi comparison that created a rift with berlin .
it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .
" i ’ m sure of myself .
i ’ ve never been down because of the criticism that seems to be unfounded , in my opinion , " italian news agency agi quoted berlusconi as saying this week .

israel 's announcement that it would " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat has met with international criticism everywhere from the u.s. state department to the office of french president jacques chirac . following the announcement thursday evening by the israeli cabinet , german foreign minister joschka fischer , a sometime middle east peace negotiator , embarked on a marathon of phone calls with other european leaders . the consensus was unanimous : the israeli cabinet 's decision to " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat " in a manner that will be determined separately , " would only escalate the israeli-palestinian conflict , which had just endured a bloody few days . " the decision is not appropriate for stabilizing the dangerous situation in the middle east , " said a spokesman for germany 's foreign ministry . france , which considers arafat the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , and the european union issued similar statements and a state department official told reuters that removal would only give arafat an " international stage on which he would continue to be an obstacle to peace . " describing any decision to expel arafat as a " terrible mistake , " european commission spokesman diego de ojeda said : " nothing has changed from our point of view .
mr arafat remains the democratically elected president of the palestinian authority and as such we shall continue with our contacts with the palestinian authority at all levels depending on circumstances . " palestinians swarm arafat headquarters arafat emerged from his headquarters in the west bank city of ramallah thursday evening to cheers as thousands of supporters promised to defend him .

germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .
those growth figures , however , only hold if employees work more hours for the same pay . get to work ! leading politicians of various stripes are advocating longer hours .
earlier this summer , wolfgang clement , the economics minister , set off a small firestorm when he suggested germans drop one of their holidays to help spur economic growth . " as far as vacations , holidays and work hours go , we 've reached the limit , " he said . the head of germany 's conservative christian democrats , angela merkel , also weighed in , suggesting that working hours in western germany , which are generally shorter than those in the eastern part of the country , should be lengthened . " we are going to have to work longer again if we are going to keep up with other countries , " the cdu leader told the tabloid newspaper , bild . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's liberal party , said working more hours a week was preferable to having to wait until the age of 67 or 70 to retire , which could become a reality given the state of germany 's pension system . " we will not be able to maintain our current level of prosperity with less work , only with more , " he said . holiday history germany 's leisure habits are rooted in the country 's " economic miracle " years of the 1950s through the 1970s , when the country rebuilt its industries from the wreckage of world war two and became an export powerhouse .
at that time , germans worked more than americans . but as growth slowed in the 1980s and unemployment grew , unions bargained for more vacation days and shorter hours based on the theory that cutting hours per worker gave more workers a chance at a job . unions say no unions have reacted angrily to the suggestion of a longer work week , accusing employers of using the debate as a cover to lower wages across the board .
labor leaders say lengthening the work week would only increase unemployment , which is already near record highs in germany , and upset germany 's delicate balance between the rights of employees and employers . " we work less in germany but have a higher level of productivity , " said dierk hirschel , an economist at the german federation of trade unions .
" we can produce more per hour because people are relaxed since they do n't have to work as much as in other countries . " he would like to see a 35 hour week become the norm . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to amusement park deutschland ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.09.2003 berlusconi stirs up a storm with mussolini comments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the hot seat - italian prime minister silvio berlusconi .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und der italienische ministerpräsident silvio berlusconi bei ihrem treffen am 8 .
märz 2002 in triest berlusconi ’ s debut as eu head earned a notorious reputation with the by now infamous nazi comparison that created a rift with berlin .
it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .
" i ’ m sure of myself .
i ’ ve never been down because of the criticism that seems to be unfounded , in my opinion , " italian news agency agi quoted berlusconi as saying this week .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schröder und der italienische ministerpräsident silvio berlusconi bei ihrem treffen am 8 .
märz 2002 in triest berlusconi ’ s debut as eu head earned a notorious reputation with the by now infamous nazi comparison that created a rift with berlin .
it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .
" i ’ m sure of myself .
i ’ ve never been down because of the criticism that seems to be unfounded , in my opinion , " italian news agency agi quoted berlusconi as saying this week .

germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .
those growth figures , however , only hold if employees work more hours for the same pay . get to work ! leading politicians of various stripes are advocating longer hours .
earlier this summer , wolfgang clement , the economics minister , set off a small firestorm when he suggested germans drop one of their holidays to help spur economic growth . " as far as vacations , holidays and work hours go , we 've reached the limit , " he said . the head of germany 's conservative christian democrats , angela merkel , also weighed in , suggesting that working hours in western germany , which are generally shorter than those in the eastern part of the country , should be lengthened . " we are going to have to work longer again if we are going to keep up with other countries , " the cdu leader told the tabloid newspaper , bild . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's liberal party , said working more hours a week was preferable to having to wait until the age of 67 or 70 to retire , which could become a reality given the state of germany 's pension system . " we will not be able to maintain our current level of prosperity with less work , only with more , " he said . holiday history germany 's leisure habits are rooted in the country 's " economic miracle " years of the 1950s through the 1970s , when the country rebuilt its industries from the wreckage of world war two and became an export powerhouse .
at that time , germans worked more than americans . but as growth slowed in the 1980s and unemployment grew , unions bargained for more vacation days and shorter hours based on the theory that cutting hours per worker gave more workers a chance at a job . unions say no unions have reacted angrily to the suggestion of a longer work week , accusing employers of using the debate as a cover to lower wages across the board .
labor leaders say lengthening the work week would only increase unemployment , which is already near record highs in germany , and upset germany 's delicate balance between the rights of employees and employers . " we work less in germany but have a higher level of productivity , " said dierk hirschel , an economist at the german federation of trade unions .

the government of prime minister ariel sharon had declared arafat " irrelevant " in december 2001 , and refused to negotiate with him .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .

it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .
" i ’ m sure of myself .
i ’ ve never been down because of the criticism that seems to be unfounded , in my opinion , " italian news agency agi quoted berlusconi as saying this week .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .

germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .
those growth figures , however , only hold if employees work more hours for the same pay . get to work ! leading politicians of various stripes are advocating longer hours .
earlier this summer , wolfgang clement , the economics minister , set off a small firestorm when he suggested germans drop one of their holidays to help spur economic growth . " as far as vacations , holidays and work hours go , we 've reached the limit , " he said . the head of germany 's conservative christian democrats , angela merkel , also weighed in , suggesting that working hours in western germany , which are generally shorter than those in the eastern part of the country , should be lengthened . " we are going to have to work longer again if we are going to keep up with other countries , " the cdu leader told the tabloid newspaper , bild . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's liberal party , said working more hours a week was preferable to having to wait until the age of 67 or 70 to retire , which could become a reality given the state of germany 's pension system . " we will not be able to maintain our current level of prosperity with less work , only with more , " he said . holiday history germany 's leisure habits are rooted in the country 's " economic miracle " years of the 1950s through the 1970s , when the country rebuilt its industries from the wreckage of world war two and became an export powerhouse .
at that time , germans worked more than americans . but as growth slowed in the 1980s and unemployment grew , unions bargained for more vacation days and shorter hours based on the theory that cutting hours per worker gave more workers a chance at a job . unions say no unions have reacted angrily to the suggestion of a longer work week , accusing employers of using the debate as a cover to lower wages across the board .
labor leaders say lengthening the work week would only increase unemployment , which is already near record highs in germany , and upset germany 's delicate balance between the rights of employees and employers . " we work less in germany but have a higher level of productivity , " said dierk hirschel , an economist at the german federation of trade unions .

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has sparked new controversy with comments portraying former fascist dictator mussolini as a benign leader . two months after the italian prime minister sparked outrage with a comparison of a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the scandal-prone silvio berlusconi has once again appalled critics and allies alike with controversial remarks glossing over a dark chapter of italy ’ s past .
in an interview published in the british magazine spectator on thursday , berlusconi appeared to defend the actions of italy ’ s former fascist dictator benito mussolini , who was allied with nazi dictator adolf hitler in world war two .
when asked if mussolini was " benign , " berlusconi replied : " mussolini never killed anyone .
mussolini sent people on holiday in internal exile . "
the prime minister later said he had reacted " as a patriot , as a real italian " when his interviewers had compared mussolini to deposed iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
" i never intended to reevaluate mussolini , " berlusconi said .
the italian leader also attacked the opposition and accused it of manipulating his words , adding that he couldn ’ t understand why he constantly faced a barrage of criticism as head of the government .
comments rattle a nation the italian prime minister ’ s latest gaffe has provoked anger and touched a raw nerve in a country , whose postwar democracy was founded on an anti-fascist consensus .
mussolini , also known as " il duce " -lrb- the leader -rrb- , ruled from 1922 to 1943 with an iron fist and attempted to create an italian empire in alliance with hitler ’ s germany .
he introduced italy ’ s first anti-semitic laws in 1938 , which paved the way for the eventual deportation of around 7,000 jews to nazi concentration camps .
the leftwing opposition was livid on friday and vowed berlusconi wouldn ’ t head a democracy born out of the world war two resistance movement for long .
pierluigi castagnetti , parliamentary party leader of the margherita party , told reuters the prime minister ’ s remarks were " incredible and shocking . "
senator cesare salvi , of the formerly communist democratic left , called berlusconi ’ s comments " genuinely disgraceful " and said mussolini ’ s victims " cried out for vengeance . "
amos luzzatto , president of the union of italian jewish communities said , " berlusconi ’ s comments cause me profound pain . "
berlusconi 's allies hard pressed to defend him the italian prime minister ’ s latest blunder even had his own party ranks and members of the far right national alliance , which traces its roots back to mussolini ’ s fascist movement , squirming in embarrassment .
many made no bones about their dismay .
" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .

it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .

" anti-fascism is a value that unites , " said luca volonte , parliamentary leader of the christian democrat union , an important part of berlusconi ’ s governing coalition .
" it unites the majority .
it unites the government with the opposition .
it unites the country .
to split over that which unites is senseless . "
some of berlusconi ’ s political allies rallied to his defense , blaming the uproar on a twisted interpretation of the premier 's words .
" i don ’ t want to believe that the prime minister made the comments on fascism reported by the news agencies , " giorgio la malfa , leader of the republican party said .
agriculture minister gianni alemanno of the national alliance said : " i hope this is a journalistic error . "
italian papers on friday struck a resigned note as berlusconi ’ s latest verbal faux pas hit headlines .
even the usually pro-berlusconi daily il tempo ran a title " the only thing he -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- didn ’ t do is call mussolini an honest man " .
the paper la repubblica had a story headlined " berlusconi lets fascism off the hook " .
berlusconi : i 'm just me the uproar marks the latest in a string of verbal slips for berlusconi ever since italy took over the six-month rotating eu presidency in july this year , which has given the italian leader a more prominent role on the european stage .

märz 2002 in triest berlusconi ’ s debut as eu head earned a notorious reputation with the by now infamous nazi comparison that created a rift with berlin .
it was followed by an escalating row between berlin and rome after a junior italian minister spoke degradingly of german tourists , which led german chancellor schröder -lrb- photo , left -rrb- to cancel his summer vacation to italy .
berlusconi refused to apologize .
last week , in the first part of the spectator interview , berlusconi drew ire with his comments that italy ’ s judges were " mentally disturbed " and " anthropologically different " from other people .
the glib prime minister , who insists he is often misquoted and misunderstood by the media , remained unruffled this time too .
" i ’ m sure of myself .
i ’ ve never been down because of the criticism that seems to be unfounded , in my opinion , " italian news agency agi quoted berlusconi as saying this week .

the head of the project , tom feldkamp , attributed the lower salaries to the fact that women chief executive officers were more common in smaller companies , which tended to pay less . more briefs 11.09.2003 -pipe- duisenberg fires off final shots at budget offenders 11.09.2003 -pipe- ford germany considers more job cuts 11.09.2003 -pipe- eu cuts economic forecast in half 10.09.2003 -pipe- watchdog says free samples are n't free 10.09.2003 -pipe- bayer settles more lipobay suits 10.09.2003 -pipe- german trade surplus at record level 09.09.2003 -pipe- german inflation rate increases in august 09.09.2003 -pipe- domestic demand hits mercedes car sales radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

israel 's announcement that it would " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat has met with international criticism everywhere from the u.s. state department to the office of french president jacques chirac . following the announcement thursday evening by the israeli cabinet , german foreign minister joschka fischer , a sometime middle east peace negotiator , embarked on a marathon of phone calls with other european leaders . the consensus was unanimous : the israeli cabinet 's decision to " remove " palestinian leader yasser arafat " in a manner that will be determined separately , " would only escalate the israeli-palestinian conflict , which had just endured a bloody few days . " the decision is not appropriate for stabilizing the dangerous situation in the middle east , " said a spokesman for germany 's foreign ministry . france , which considers arafat the legitimate leader of the palestinian people , and the european union issued similar statements and a state department official told reuters that removal would only give arafat an " international stage on which he would continue to be an obstacle to peace . " describing any decision to expel arafat as a " terrible mistake , " european commission spokesman diego de ojeda said : " nothing has changed from our point of view .
mr arafat remains the democratically elected president of the palestinian authority and as such we shall continue with our contacts with the palestinian authority at all levels depending on circumstances . " palestinians swarm arafat headquarters arafat emerged from his headquarters in the west bank city of ramallah thursday evening to cheers as thousands of supporters promised to defend him .
a resolute arafat said he was not going to go anywhere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orly , the mother of israeli soldier mazi grego , cries during her funeral in the city of hulon near tel aviv , wednesday sept 10 2003 .
grego was killed as a palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up tuesday killing eight people in the central israeli town of rishon letzion .
-lrb- ap photo / eitan hess-ashkenazi -rrb- the israeli reached the cabinet decision after two days of suicide bombings that left 15 israelis dead .
the government of prime minister ariel sharon had declared arafat " irrelevant " in december 2001 , and refused to negotiate with him .
under pressure from the european union , the united states , russia and the united nations , arafat stepped down this summer to help get the quartet 's " roadmap " to peace on its way .
mahmoud abbas was appointed prime minister but resigned saturday recently after escalating violence between the two sides derailed the roadmap once again . killing arafat discussed , reports say arafat-favorite ahmed qurie was designated prime minister in abbas ' place .
he responded to the israeli announcement by suspending the selection of his cabinet .
if implemented , he said , the decision would not just " blow up the palestinian territories , but also the entire region . " it was not clear what the cabinet met by " removal . "
reports speculated that the term could also mean killing arafat - a move sharon is said to be against .
middle east observers said eliminating arafat would be fruitless . " for every dead leader , three more grow in his place , " said wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert for germany 's christian democrats . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the eu treads softly in the middle east european union foreign policy head javier solana is currently visiting the middle east to promote the peace process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.09.2003 could longer work hours revive the german economy ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working longer could create more jobs , some economists say .
germans are the envy of the world when it comes to getting time off from work .
but some politicians and economists say a little more work and a little less play could do wonders for the sputtering german economy . banker gerald roski is using his lunch hour to peruse the listings at a berlin travel agency .
he 's trying to decide whether to spend his next vacation on the island of mallorca or head to dubai , where the sun is guaranteed . " i 've already been skiing in austria this year and spent some time in france .
i think some time outside of europe would be good , " he said .
" i 've got the whole month of october off . " it might sound decadent to much of the world , but in germany , eight weeks off work are the norm -lrb- when you add up vacation and the legal holidays spread throughout the year -rrb- .
germans enjoy amounts of leisure time that the rest of the world can only envy .
according to a recent study by the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- , workers in the u.s. work on average 1,884 hours a year , and in france they clock 1,545 hours .
in germany , the world 's third largest economy , workers only put in an average of 1,444 hours . " in comparison to other countries it seems like a lot of free time , but if you ask me personally , i think it 's good , " roski said . most of his compatriots would agree .
but there is a growing chorus of voices who are saying germans have reached the upper limit of leisure time and that more work during the week could boost economic growth and create jobs . the work / leisure balance " no other european country allows its employees as much vacation as germany , " the president of the german federation of chambers of commerce , ludwig george braun , told the freie presse newspaper on friday .
he said the relationship between work and leisure has become skewed and that employees ' would do the economy a favor by working longer and more flexible hours .
he wants a forty hour week to become the norm , instead of the 37 hours that germans , on average , work in five days . " german people have very short working times compared to people in other countries , and this undoubtedly has a negative impact on the competitiveness of our economy , " said hagen lesch , an economist at the business-friendly cologne institute of business research , who conducted a study on working hours and the german economy .
if the german work week were immediately increased by one hour , the study concluded , the country 's gross domestic product could rise by € 22 billion -lrb- $ 24.8 billion -rrb- this year alone . the study found that the longer work week could bring about growth rates of 1.6 percent in 2004 and create 60,000 to 70,000 jobs .
that is significant in view of the fact that the economy has only grown by 0.2 percent this year and is expected to expand only 0.6 percent next year .
those growth figures , however , only hold if employees work more hours for the same pay . get to work ! leading politicians of various stripes are advocating longer hours .
earlier this summer , wolfgang clement , the economics minister , set off a small firestorm when he suggested germans drop one of their holidays to help spur economic growth . " as far as vacations , holidays and work hours go , we 've reached the limit , " he said . the head of germany 's conservative christian democrats , angela merkel , also weighed in , suggesting that working hours in western germany , which are generally shorter than those in the eastern part of the country , should be lengthened . " we are going to have to work longer again if we are going to keep up with other countries , " the cdu leader told the tabloid newspaper , bild . guido westerwelle , head of germany 's liberal party , said working more hours a week was preferable to having to wait until the age of 67 or 70 to retire , which could become a reality given the state of germany 's pension system . " we will not be able to maintain our current level of prosperity with less work , only with more , " he said . holiday history germany 's leisure habits are rooted in the country 's " economic miracle " years of the 1950s through the 1970s , when the country rebuilt its industries from the wreckage of world war two and became an export powerhouse .
at that time , germans worked more than americans . but as growth slowed in the 1980s and unemployment grew , unions bargained for more vacation days and shorter hours based on the theory that cutting hours per worker gave more workers a chance at a job . unions say no unions have reacted angrily to the suggestion of a longer work week , accusing employers of using the debate as a cover to lower wages across the board .
labor leaders say lengthening the work week would only increase unemployment , which is already near record highs in germany , and upset germany 's delicate balance between the rights of employees and employers . " we work less in germany but have a higher level of productivity , " said dierk hirschel , an economist at the german federation of trade unions .
" we can produce more per hour because people are relaxed since they do n't have to work as much as in other countries . " he would like to see a 35 hour week become the norm . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an end to amusement park deutschland ?

digby jones was speaking as he prepared to meet trade secretary patricia hewitt and the uk delegation to the world trade organisation talks in cancun , mexico .
mr jones said the eu and us should respond to demands from developing countries on farming , for the sake of free and fair trade .
farm subsidy per cow eu : $ 803 usa : $ 1,057 japan : $ 2,555 the eu spends about $ 100bn -lrb- £ 63bn -rrb- on propping up its own farmers .
economists estimate the world 's poor countries lose a total of $ 24bn -lrb- £ 15bn -rrb- a year because of the subsidies paid to farmers by rich nations .
' seize the moment ' a new coalition of developing countries - styled the g21 - has been formed in cancun to present a united front on behalf of those calling for reform .
mr jones , who will be advising the uk delegation at the talks on behalf of british business , believes europe and america should respond to the new group 's position .
he said failing to do so could put hopes of an agreement in jeopardy .
he said : " agriculture has become the biggest single block to progress in the doha development agenda which has the potential to benefit billions of people .
" the eu and us will fail to win the case for global free and fair trade unless they prove they can practice what they preach . "
the cbi chief believes the eu and us should " seize the moment " by setting out specific proposals on cutting farm subsidies .
" now is the time for action if the goal of free and fair trade to the benefit of developing and developed countries is not to be jeopardised . "
the calls came after europe and the united states were accused of trying to smash a powerful new alliance of poor states bent on re-writing world trade rules .
standing firm the g21 , which includes china , india and brazil , is demanding the complete abolition of subsidies paid by rich countries to their farmers which , they say , locks the developing world out of international markets .
the eu and the us have promised to reform the subsidies , but their initial suggestions have been criticised for not going far enough .
they say poorer countries must agree to broader legal and commercial reforms in return for any concessions on farming .
aid agency action aid accused the us delegation at cancun of attempting to bully poor nations into accepting its proposals - an accusation that was vehemently denied .
but the g21 was , so far , standing firm and new members were expected to join in the next few days , action aid added .
on wednesday around 5,000 protesters were blocked by riot police from marching on the meeting .
a south korean farmer stabbed himself to death in what a friend called an " act of sacrifice " to show his disgust at the wto and its policies .

digby jones was speaking as he prepared to meet trade secretary patricia hewitt and the uk delegation to the world trade organisation talks in cancun , mexico .
mr jones said the eu and us should respond to demands from developing countries on farming , for the sake of free and fair trade .
farm subsidy per cow eu : $ 803 usa : $ 1,057 japan : $ 2,555 the eu spends about $ 100bn -lrb- £ 63bn -rrb- on propping up its own farmers .
economists estimate the world 's poor countries lose a total of $ 24bn -lrb- £ 15bn -rrb- a year because of the subsidies paid to farmers by rich nations .
' seize the moment ' a new coalition of developing countries - styled the g21 - has been formed in cancun to present a united front on behalf of those calling for reform .
mr jones , who will be advising the uk delegation at the talks on behalf of british business , believes europe and america should respond to the new group 's position .

the cbi chief believes the eu and us should " seize the moment " by setting out specific proposals on cutting farm subsidies .
" now is the time for action if the goal of free and fair trade to the benefit of developing and developed countries is not to be jeopardised . "
the calls came after europe and the united states were accused of trying to smash a powerful new alliance of poor states bent on re-writing world trade rules .
standing firm the g21 , which includes china , india and brazil , is demanding the complete abolition of subsidies paid by rich countries to their farmers which , they say , locks the developing world out of international markets .
the eu and the us have promised to reform the subsidies , but their initial suggestions have been criticised for not going far enough .
they say poorer countries must agree to broader legal and commercial reforms in return for any concessions on farming .
aid agency action aid accused the us delegation at cancun of attempting to bully poor nations into accepting its proposals - an accusation that was vehemently denied .

"
species are still teetering on the brink of extinction - in the very places designed to provide them with safe refuge " john hanks , conservation international most of the shortfall occurs in developing countries , the ones richest in wildlife .
to expand protection to all the areas that need it , they say , would mean a threefold spending increase for a decade .
but they say protecting nature usually pays for itself in benefits to society .
the estimate comes from an international panel of economists , scientists , governments and protected area managers .
skewed spending it is published by the us-based conservation international 's center for applied biodiversity science , the university of cambridge , uk , and birdlife international , a consortium of wildlife groups working in more than 100 countries .
the findings were released at the world parks congress in durban , south africa , organised by iucn-the world conservation union .
the authors say global funding for parks and other protected areas is $ 7bn annually , less than $ 1bn of which is spent in the developing world .
they estimate the shortfall in maintaining the existing protected area network at $ 2.5bn a year .
but to expand the network so that it could conserve many of the most threatened but currently unprotected species would cost about $ 23bn annually for the next 10 years , they say .
they describe the plight of many protected areas today : " tens of thousands , most dramatically those in the developing world , suffer from a chronic lack of funding , resulting in a shortage of staff , ranger stations , communications equipment , vehicles and other basic infrastructure . "
trade threat conservation international says the spending shortfall often has " catastrophic " consequences : " in west africa , for example , funding of many parks is so poor that areas once rich with elephants , hippos and monkeys are now empty .
" in latin america , protected areas have been cleared for agriculture , and in asia the last individuals of some of the world 's most amazing species - tigers , monkeys and crocodiles - are poached for illegal sale . "
john hanks of conservation international said : " the acceleration of human encroachment is transforming vast natural areas , and species are still teetering on the brink of extinction - in the very places designed to provide them with safe refuge . "
aaron bruner , manager of conservation economics for the organisation , said : " for $ 23bn , significantly less than americans spend on soft drinks alone each year , we can save a large number of the places that house the greatest diversity of life on earth .
bargain price " and for a fraction of that , just $ 1.5bn a year , we could take the vital step of making sure that basic management of all existing protected areas in developing countries is well funded . "
a study published in 2002 in the journal science said the long-term economic benefit from healthy ecosystems was far greater than the cost of protecting them .
but development in wild areas jeopardised flood and storm protection , the protection of watersheds , and the uptake by vegetation of carbon dioxide , thought to contribute significantly to climate change .
the study put the value of these services at $ 33 trillion a year worldwide .
conservation international says establishing and managing protected areas often provides direct benefits to poor communities as well .

the audit commission said salford city council 's re-development of particular areas , like salford quays , was particularly " impressive " .
thousands of jobs have been created at the quays , which has benefited from investments of hundreds of millions of pounds .
however , the report also criticises the council over its failure to prioritise environmental issues and says its planning processes are " inaccessible to the public " .
' permanent jobs ' sue sunderland , relationship manager at the commission , said : " salford council has developed a detailed knowledge and understanding of the needs of the area .
" its top priority is the social , economic and physical regeneration of the city .
" a number of impressive achievements to date include 10,000 permanent jobs created via development at salford quays , £ 300m investment attracted to the area due to the success of the lowry arts centre .
" -lsb- there has also been -rsb- over 100 new homes in the chapel street area and the refurbishment of eccles town centre . "
' confusing committees ' the report also detailed , among other strengths , how the council has developed an effective integrated health , social care and community services for residents .

abdellatif merroun , who has dual british and moroccan nationality , denies allegations that he was connected to the attack , which killed 45 people .
it is not yet known what charges he will face , but they could include criminal association - shorthand for belonging to the banned islamist organisation , salafia jihadia , which was blamed for the attacks .
mr merroun is the second british national to be tried on terrorism charges in morocco since the bombings .
last month anthony perry jensen , 37 , from london , was acquitted at the high court in fez of belonging to salafia jihadia .
however , he was sentenced to four months in prison for " immorality " for failing to properly register his marriage to 17-year-old moroccan fatima ezera .
witnesses abdellatif merroun was picked up by moroccan police in a wave of arrests following the bombings .
he will be tried in the court of appeal in the capital , rabat .
sources say he has already had a pre-trial confrontation with witnesses who say he was involved with one of the movement 's spiritual leaders - an allegation he has denied .
mr merroun has rejected his court-appointed lawyer and hired his own defence .
he told british officials that he was roughly handled by police on his arrest , but does not claim to have been tortured .
mr merroun is a moroccan by birth who became a british national after marrying an english woman .
the five suicide bombs on 16 may tore through a spanish restaurant , the belgian consulate , a jewish community centre and cemetery and a hotel .
thirty-three people were killed , along with 12 suicide bombers .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- rich and poor clash over farm aid bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies friday , 12 september , 2003 , 05:46 gmt 06:46 uk rich and poor clash over farm aid europe and the united states have been accused of trying to break up a powerful new alliance of poor states bent on rewriting global trade rules .
the group of 21 -lrb- g21 -rrb- , which includes china , india and brazil , has threatened the traditional dominance of rich countries during world trade talks in cancun , mexico .
the g21 is demanding the complete abolition of subsidies paid by rich countries to their farmers which , they say , locks the developing world out of international markets .
but aid agency action aid has accused the us delegation at cancun of attempting to alternately cajole and bully poor nations into leaving the g21 - an accusation the americans have denied .
the charity claims us trade representative robert zoellick attempted to bribe some countries into dropping out of the group with trade incentives .
it said costa rica , el salvador and guatemala had been offered increased trade quotas if they quit the alliance .
a spokesman for the us delegation said : " this is an outrageous accusation that is groundless . "
the eu and the us have promised to reform the subsidies , but their initial suggestions have been criticised for not going far enough .
in other developments : the wto has agreed to admit nepal and cambodia as new members .
they are the first countries classified as least developed to join the trade body since it was founded in 1995 .
the street protests which marked the first day of the meeting , including the suicide of a south korean farmer on wednesday , have died down .
a greenpeace protester from mexico disrupted a us press briefing , leading the wto to ban all non-governmental organisations from attending future news conferences .
with the issue of farm subsidies still at a stand-off , a group of 16 developing countries are teaming up to oppose the launch of new negotiations on investment and competition rules .
farming row the row over farming subsidies has dominated the meetings so far , and there is likely to be little progress on other issues until an agreement has been reached .
the g21 say the rich world needs to keep the promises it made two years ago to cut tariffs .
the farming debate the eu and us say poorer countries must agree to broader legal and commercial reforms in return for any concessions on farming .
rich countries give their farmers $ 320bn in handouts , more than six times the amount they give to poor countries as aid .
so far , the g21 was standing firm , and new members were expected to join in the next few days , action aid said .
the big question now was whether the alliance could remain united , or whether " the us would pick countries off one by one , " a spokeswoman told bbc news online .
the g21 could shift the power at the 146-nation wto talks towards the poor world for the first time , she added .
but the danger for developing nations is that if they hold out for a better deal the five-day talks will end in failure , and they will be stuck with current trade agreements for several more years .
with the 2004 us presidential election looming , the us is likely to find it hard to improve on what it sees as a generous offer that has already drawn political flak .
' not a threat ' delegates from both the eu and us attempted to undermine the g21 on thursday by writing it off as a marriage of convenience .
" it 's really unclear to us what is the unifying principle there among those countries , " said deputy us trade representative peter allgeier .
" on the one hand , you 've got some of those countries that were among the most ambitious countries for agricultural reform .
" then it goes across the spectrum ... to countries that have not been advocates of reform , " he told reporters .
another senior us official questioned what brazil had in common with fellow g21 member india , which shelters behind some of the world 's highest tariff walls and is reluctant to open its markets .
the eu , which spends about $ 100bn on propping up its own farmers , said it was unconcerned by g21 pressure .
" we do not see the g21 as some kind of a threat , " said eu spokeswoman arancha gonzalez .
" it is a temporary alliance which wants to push the joint interests of its members together . "

the group of 21 -lrb- g21 -rrb- , which includes china , india and brazil , has threatened the traditional dominance of rich countries during world trade talks in cancun , mexico .
the g21 is demanding the complete abolition of subsidies paid by rich countries to their farmers which , they say , locks the developing world out of international markets .
but aid agency action aid has accused the us delegation at cancun of attempting to alternately cajole and bully poor nations into leaving the g21 - an accusation the americans have denied .
the charity claims us trade representative robert zoellick attempted to bribe some countries into dropping out of the group with trade incentives .
it said costa rica , el salvador and guatemala had been offered increased trade quotas if they quit the alliance .
a spokesman for the us delegation said : " this is an outrageous accusation that is groundless . "
the eu and the us have promised to reform the subsidies , but their initial suggestions have been criticised for not going far enough .
in other developments : the wto has agreed to admit nepal and cambodia as new members .
they are the first countries classified as least developed to join the trade body since it was founded in 1995 .
the street protests which marked the first day of the meeting , including the suicide of a south korean farmer on wednesday , have died down .
a greenpeace protester from mexico disrupted a us press briefing , leading the wto to ban all non-governmental organisations from attending future news conferences .
with the issue of farm subsidies still at a stand-off , a group of 16 developing countries are teaming up to oppose the launch of new negotiations on investment and competition rules .
farming row the row over farming subsidies has dominated the meetings so far , and there is likely to be little progress on other issues until an agreement has been reached .
the g21 say the rich world needs to keep the promises it made two years ago to cut tariffs .
the farming debate the cost to the poor of farming subsidies the eu and us say poorer countries must agree to broader legal and commercial reforms in return for any concessions on farming .
rich countries give their farmers $ 320bn in handouts , more than six times the amount they give to poor countries as aid .
so far , the g21 was standing firm , and new members were expected to join in the next few days , action aid said .
the big question now was whether the alliance could remain united , or whether " the us would pick countries off one by one , " a spokeswoman told bbc news online .
the g21 could shift the power at the 146-nation wto talks towards the poor world for the first time , she added .
but the danger for developing nations is that if they hold out for a better deal the five-day talks will end in failure , and they will be stuck with current trade agreements for several more years .
with the 2004 us presidential election looming , the us is likely to find it hard to improve on what it sees as a generous offer that has already drawn political flak .
' not a threat ' delegates from both the eu and us attempted to undermine the g21 on thursday by writing it off as a marriage of convenience .
the memory of the farmer who committed suicide is being kept alive " it 's really unclear to us what is the unifying principle there among those countries , " said deputy us trade representative peter allgeier .

the board of administration is asking the states to approve plans for a waste to energy plant which it has said would cost £ 72m , and could be up and running by 2006 at longue hougue .
however , douzenier michelle levrier of guernsey friends of the earth has warned that other charges , such as insurance , contingency funds and consultation fees , could be added on to this .
this could bring the total cost up to £ 82m .
rubbish options the board of administration 's proposed new plant could process up to 70,000 tonnes of refuse a year and provide 10 % of the island 's electricity .
deputy roger berry of the board is warning guernsey could start to run out of options rubbish disposal-wise once the mont cuet landfill site is full .

hundreds of people met at the civic hall in whitehaven on thursday night to hear about possible changes to mental health care .
managers want to see more care in the community , with people needing hospital treatment sent to the carleton clinic in carlisle .
nigel woodcock , chief executive of the north cumbria primary care trusts , said the move would improve the quality of care patients receive .
he said : " it is about ensuring we are providing safe and effective services , that we are providing a better therapeutic environment than we are currently providing in some of our facilities .
' travel stress ' " it is also about delivering an overall better quality environment , such as single-sex accommodation . "

an animal welfare group said on friday that the sheep should be put down , amid claims that thousands of the animals had already died .
the sheep arrived in saudi arabia for import five weeks ago , but were rejected because the kingdom claimed 6 % of them were suffering from scabby mouth disease .
this was 1 % more than the saudi government agreed to allow .
according to hugh wirth , australian president of the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals , 3,500 of the sheep have now died .
he said the sheep were facing temperatures of 45-50 degrees centigrade -lrb- 113-122 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- .
" it 's a fairly hefty option to kill 57,000 sheep , but the fact of life is , what alternative have we got ? " he said in an interview with abc radio .
australian greens senator bob brown agreed that the sheep should be put down .
" it 's just horrific that this ship has been turned into a death ship , " senator brown told reporters .
" there are hundreds of sheep dying every day and the rate will increase . "
' premature ' panic but the chief executive of australia 's livestock export corporation insisted the sheep were not in particular danger .
" they are in good condition under the circumstances and for that reason we feel it would be premature to put the sheep down , " said kevin sheill .
" we are certainly not at that stage , there is a vet and a stockman with them with plenty of supplies , the ship is a bit like a floating feedlot , " he said .
mr sheill said negotiations were under way with another middle east country to accept the cargo .
