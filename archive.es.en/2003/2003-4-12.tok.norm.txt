germany 's chancellor is meeting with the leaders of france and russia to discuss their stance on postwar iraq .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell says the u.n. security council 's role could be limited . german chancellor gerhard schröder has made up his mind .
either the united nations will be a guiding force in the reconstruction of iraq or germany will not participate .
the chancellor who waged a diplomatic campaign to stop the war from being launched laid out his position with the private television network rtl on thursday night .
" germany can and will join the reconstruction effort if it is conducted under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder said .
the chancellor made the comments a day before he travels to st. petersburg , russia , to discuss the question with two other allies in the anti-war effort - french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
the leaders are meeting three days after president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair pledged at their northern ireland war council that the united nations would have a " vital role " to play in the reconstruction effort .
russian pushes u.n. role as the st. petersburg summit approached , russian foreign minister igor ivanov spelled out his government 's position .
ivanov said the united nations should have a " central role " in postwar iraq .
" this authority must be used to achieve a political settlement in iraq within the shortest time possible , " ivanov said .
" this is in the interests of the iraqi people .
this is in the interests of the whole region . "
the debate over the role of the united nations is shaping up to be the next point of conflict between the u.s.-led coalition fighting in iraq and the european nations that futilely fought the american plan in the u.n. security council .
blair has also endorsed a u.n. role .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview published on friday by the german newspaper die welt that it would be wrong to assume that the war-fighting coalition would be willing to hand over total responsibility to the security council now that the iraqi regime has been overthrown .
like the world community , americans are divided on the issue as well .
a survey conducted by the pew research center found this week that 62 percent of respondents thought the united nations should play a significant role in post-war iraq .
it found that 31 percent did not .
the public is divided over the issue of who should have the most say in this process : 38 percent believe the united nations should take the lead in establishing a stable government in iraq , compared with 49 percent who either believe washington and its allies should have the most say or reject any un role .
u.s. seeks international support the united nations is one of many international organizations where officials are discussing the future of iraq .
u.s. treasury secretary john snow plans to use the weekend meetings of the 184-nation international monetary fund and the world bank to start pulling together the resources to rebuild iraq .
the lending organizations said they were prepared to send fact-finding missions to iraq once it was safe to do so .
preliminary estimates on the cost of rebuilding iraq range from $ 20 billion a year for the first few years to as much as $ 600 billion over a decade .
snow said he would seek support among the group of seven leading industrial powers for forgiving a part of iraq 's foreign debt , estimated to be as high as $ 200 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic opposition member friedrich merz amid the debate in germany over the future of iraq , a leading member of the opposition christian democratic union linked germany 's participation to the reconstruction efforts to the awarding of contracts to german companies .

" that goes without saying . "
in the television interview , schröder said he did not understand such a demand .

the chancellor who waged a diplomatic campaign to stop the war from being launched laid out his position with the private television network rtl on thursday night .

the debate over the role of the united nations is shaping up to be the next point of conflict between the u.s.-led coalition fighting in iraq and the european nations that futilely fought the american plan in the u.n. security council .
blair has also endorsed a u.n. role .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview published on friday by the german newspaper die welt that it would be wrong to assume that the war-fighting coalition would be willing to hand over total responsibility to the security council now that the iraqi regime has been overthrown .
like the world community , americans are divided on the issue as well .
a survey conducted by the pew research center found this week that 62 percent of respondents thought the united nations should play a significant role in post-war iraq .
it found that 31 percent did not .
the public is divided over the issue of who should have the most say in this process : 38 percent believe the united nations should take the lead in establishing a stable government in iraq , compared with 49 percent who either believe washington and its allies should have the most say or reject any un role .

u.s. treasury secretary john snow plans to use the weekend meetings of the 184-nation international monetary fund and the world bank to start pulling together the resources to rebuild iraq .
the lending organizations said they were prepared to send fact-finding missions to iraq once it was safe to do so .
preliminary estimates on the cost of rebuilding iraq range from $ 20 billion a year for the first few years to as much as $ 600 billion over a decade .
snow said he would seek support among the group of seven leading industrial powers for forgiving a part of iraq 's foreign debt , estimated to be as high as $ 200 billion .

starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays . beginning in june , shops in germany will be able to remain open until 8 p.m. on saturdays , four hours longer than currently allowed .
the bundesrat , the upper chamber that of parliament represents germany ’ s federal states , on friday quickly approved legislation that had already cleared the lower chamber last month . “ i hope very much that the new opportunities will invigorate consumer spending and in turn the economy , ” said german economy minister wolfgang clement after the bundesrat vote . the center-left coalition of german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year agreed to liberalize shop hours in an attempt to bring germany in line with other modern economies and spur domestic demand . german regulations among most restrictive germany has long had some of the most restrictive shop hours in the industrialized world .
currently retail businesses are only allowed to open until 8 p.m. during the week and 4 p.m. on saturdays .

the law regulating opening times was first set in 1956 and was last reformed in the 1990s . though the conservative opposition and their liberal allies approved the extension of hours in the bundesrat , they said the government ’ s reform doesn ’ t go nearly far enough .

germany 's chancellor is meeting with the leaders of france and russia to discuss their stance on postwar iraq .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell says the u.n. security council 's role could be limited . german chancellor gerhard schröder has made up his mind .
either the united nations will be a guiding force in the reconstruction of iraq or germany will not participate .
the chancellor who waged a diplomatic campaign to stop the war from being launched laid out his position with the private television network rtl on thursday night .
" germany can and will join the reconstruction effort if it is conducted under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder said .
the chancellor made the comments a day before he travels to st. petersburg , russia , to discuss the question with two other allies in the anti-war effort - french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
the leaders are meeting three days after president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair pledged at their northern ireland war council that the united nations would have a " vital role " to play in the reconstruction effort .
russian pushes u.n. role as the st. petersburg summit approached , russian foreign minister igor ivanov spelled out his government 's position .
ivanov said the united nations should have a " central role " in postwar iraq .
" this authority must be used to achieve a political settlement in iraq within the shortest time possible , " ivanov said .
" this is in the interests of the iraqi people .
this is in the interests of the whole region . "
the debate over the role of the united nations is shaping up to be the next point of conflict between the u.s.-led coalition fighting in iraq and the european nations that futilely fought the american plan in the u.n. security council .
blair has also endorsed a u.n. role .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview published on friday by the german newspaper die welt that it would be wrong to assume that the war-fighting coalition would be willing to hand over total responsibility to the security council now that the iraqi regime has been overthrown .
like the world community , americans are divided on the issue as well .
a survey conducted by the pew research center found this week that 62 percent of respondents thought the united nations should play a significant role in post-war iraq .
it found that 31 percent did not .
the public is divided over the issue of who should have the most say in this process : 38 percent believe the united nations should take the lead in establishing a stable government in iraq , compared with 49 percent who either believe washington and its allies should have the most say or reject any un role .
u.s. seeks international support the united nations is one of many international organizations where officials are discussing the future of iraq .
u.s. treasury secretary john snow plans to use the weekend meetings of the 184-nation international monetary fund and the world bank to start pulling together the resources to rebuild iraq .
the lending organizations said they were prepared to send fact-finding missions to iraq once it was safe to do so .
preliminary estimates on the cost of rebuilding iraq range from $ 20 billion a year for the first few years to as much as $ 600 billion over a decade .
snow said he would seek support among the group of seven leading industrial powers for forgiving a part of iraq 's foreign debt , estimated to be as high as $ 200 billion .

germany 's chancellor is meeting with the leaders of france and russia to discuss their stance on postwar iraq .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell says the u.n. security council 's role could be limited . german chancellor gerhard schröder has made up his mind .
either the united nations will be a guiding force in the reconstruction of iraq or germany will not participate .
the chancellor who waged a diplomatic campaign to stop the war from being launched laid out his position with the private television network rtl on thursday night .
" germany can and will join the reconstruction effort if it is conducted under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder said .
the chancellor made the comments a day before he travels to st. petersburg , russia , to discuss the question with two other allies in the anti-war effort - french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
the leaders are meeting three days after president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair pledged at their northern ireland war council that the united nations would have a " vital role " to play in the reconstruction effort .
russian pushes u.n. role as the st. petersburg summit approached , russian foreign minister igor ivanov spelled out his government 's position .
ivanov said the united nations should have a " central role " in postwar iraq .
" this authority must be used to achieve a political settlement in iraq within the shortest time possible , " ivanov said .
" this is in the interests of the iraqi people .
this is in the interests of the whole region . "
the debate over the role of the united nations is shaping up to be the next point of conflict between the u.s.-led coalition fighting in iraq and the european nations that futilely fought the american plan in the u.n. security council .
blair has also endorsed a u.n. role .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview published on friday by the german newspaper die welt that it would be wrong to assume that the war-fighting coalition would be willing to hand over total responsibility to the security council now that the iraqi regime has been overthrown .
like the world community , americans are divided on the issue as well .
a survey conducted by the pew research center found this week that 62 percent of respondents thought the united nations should play a significant role in post-war iraq .
it found that 31 percent did not .
the public is divided over the issue of who should have the most say in this process : 38 percent believe the united nations should take the lead in establishing a stable government in iraq , compared with 49 percent who either believe washington and its allies should have the most say or reject any un role .
u.s. seeks international support the united nations is one of many international organizations where officials are discussing the future of iraq .
u.s. treasury secretary john snow plans to use the weekend meetings of the 184-nation international monetary fund and the world bank to start pulling together the resources to rebuild iraq .
the lending organizations said they were prepared to send fact-finding missions to iraq once it was safe to do so .
preliminary estimates on the cost of rebuilding iraq range from $ 20 billion a year for the first few years to as much as $ 600 billion over a decade .
snow said he would seek support among the group of seven leading industrial powers for forgiving a part of iraq 's foreign debt , estimated to be as high as $ 200 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic opposition member friedrich merz amid the debate in germany over the future of iraq , a leading member of the opposition christian democratic union linked germany 's participation to the reconstruction efforts to the awarding of contracts to german companies .

starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays . beginning in june , shops in germany will be able to remain open until 8 p.m. on saturdays , four hours longer than currently allowed .
the bundesrat , the upper chamber that of parliament represents germany ’ s federal states , on friday quickly approved legislation that had already cleared the lower chamber last month . “ i hope very much that the new opportunities will invigorate consumer spending and in turn the economy , ” said german economy minister wolfgang clement after the bundesrat vote . the center-left coalition of german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year agreed to liberalize shop hours in an attempt to bring germany in line with other modern economies and spur domestic demand . german regulations among most restrictive germany has long had some of the most restrictive shop hours in the industrialized world .
currently retail businesses are only allowed to open until 8 p.m. during the week and 4 p.m. on saturdays .
shopping on sunday and holidays , however , remains verboten .
the law regulating opening times was first set in 1956 and was last reformed in the 1990s . though the conservative opposition and their liberal allies approved the extension of hours in the bundesrat , they said the government ’ s reform doesn ’ t go nearly far enough .
some politicians have called for the complete deregulation of open hours , including sundays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust “ many had wished that a small step could become a giant leap , ” said ole von beust , hamburg ’ s conservative mayor .
but the extra time on saturday could mean fewer hectic weekends spent jockeying with pensioners who viciously elbow their way to the front of the vegetable display in hamburg and other german cities .
buying groceries at 3:30 p.m. on a saturday , when everyone is worried they 'll have to spend the next 40 hours without food , is considered by some shoppers as one of the most unpleasant experiences you can have in germany . less stress supporters of the law say making shopping a less stressful experience might also reinvigorate the ailing retail sector .
besides relieving the congestion in the stores themselves - thereby enticing more people to shop - some analysts think longer opening hours will create more jobs in a country where unemployment loiters chronically over 10 percent . “ in the current , extremely difficult situation retailers need the extra four hours on saturdays as quickly as possible , “ said johann hellwege , the head of the bag retail association . but trade unions remain incensed about the expansion of store hours , arguing it won ’ t boost sales or contribute a significantly amount of new jobs .

germany 's chancellor is meeting with the leaders of france and russia to discuss their stance on postwar iraq .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell says the u.n. security council 's role could be limited . german chancellor gerhard schröder has made up his mind .
either the united nations will be a guiding force in the reconstruction of iraq or germany will not participate .
the chancellor who waged a diplomatic campaign to stop the war from being launched laid out his position with the private television network rtl on thursday night .
" germany can and will join the reconstruction effort if it is conducted under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder said .
the chancellor made the comments a day before he travels to st. petersburg , russia , to discuss the question with two other allies in the anti-war effort - french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
the leaders are meeting three days after president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair pledged at their northern ireland war council that the united nations would have a " vital role " to play in the reconstruction effort .
russian pushes u.n. role as the st. petersburg summit approached , russian foreign minister igor ivanov spelled out his government 's position .
ivanov said the united nations should have a " central role " in postwar iraq .
" this authority must be used to achieve a political settlement in iraq within the shortest time possible , " ivanov said .
" this is in the interests of the iraqi people .
this is in the interests of the whole region . "
the debate over the role of the united nations is shaping up to be the next point of conflict between the u.s.-led coalition fighting in iraq and the european nations that futilely fought the american plan in the u.n. security council .
blair has also endorsed a u.n. role .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview published on friday by the german newspaper die welt that it would be wrong to assume that the war-fighting coalition would be willing to hand over total responsibility to the security council now that the iraqi regime has been overthrown .
like the world community , americans are divided on the issue as well .
a survey conducted by the pew research center found this week that 62 percent of respondents thought the united nations should play a significant role in post-war iraq .
it found that 31 percent did not .
the public is divided over the issue of who should have the most say in this process : 38 percent believe the united nations should take the lead in establishing a stable government in iraq , compared with 49 percent who either believe washington and its allies should have the most say or reject any un role .
u.s. seeks international support the united nations is one of many international organizations where officials are discussing the future of iraq .
u.s. treasury secretary john snow plans to use the weekend meetings of the 184-nation international monetary fund and the world bank to start pulling together the resources to rebuild iraq .
the lending organizations said they were prepared to send fact-finding missions to iraq once it was safe to do so .
preliminary estimates on the cost of rebuilding iraq range from $ 20 billion a year for the first few years to as much as $ 600 billion over a decade .
snow said he would seek support among the group of seven leading industrial powers for forgiving a part of iraq 's foreign debt , estimated to be as high as $ 200 billion .

germany 's chancellor is meeting with the leaders of france and russia to discuss their stance on postwar iraq .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell says the u.n. security council 's role could be limited . german chancellor gerhard schröder has made up his mind .
either the united nations will be a guiding force in the reconstruction of iraq or germany will not participate .
the chancellor who waged a diplomatic campaign to stop the war from being launched laid out his position with the private television network rtl on thursday night .
" germany can and will join the reconstruction effort if it is conducted under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder said .
the chancellor made the comments a day before he travels to st. petersburg , russia , to discuss the question with two other allies in the anti-war effort - french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
the leaders are meeting three days after president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair pledged at their northern ireland war council that the united nations would have a " vital role " to play in the reconstruction effort .
russian pushes u.n. role as the st. petersburg summit approached , russian foreign minister igor ivanov spelled out his government 's position .
ivanov said the united nations should have a " central role " in postwar iraq .
" this authority must be used to achieve a political settlement in iraq within the shortest time possible , " ivanov said .
" this is in the interests of the iraqi people .
this is in the interests of the whole region . "
the debate over the role of the united nations is shaping up to be the next point of conflict between the u.s.-led coalition fighting in iraq and the european nations that futilely fought the american plan in the u.n. security council .
blair has also endorsed a u.n. role .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview published on friday by the german newspaper die welt that it would be wrong to assume that the war-fighting coalition would be willing to hand over total responsibility to the security council now that the iraqi regime has been overthrown .
like the world community , americans are divided on the issue as well .
a survey conducted by the pew research center found this week that 62 percent of respondents thought the united nations should play a significant role in post-war iraq .
it found that 31 percent did not .
the public is divided over the issue of who should have the most say in this process : 38 percent believe the united nations should take the lead in establishing a stable government in iraq , compared with 49 percent who either believe washington and its allies should have the most say or reject any un role .
u.s. seeks international support the united nations is one of many international organizations where officials are discussing the future of iraq .
u.s. treasury secretary john snow plans to use the weekend meetings of the 184-nation international monetary fund and the world bank to start pulling together the resources to rebuild iraq .
the lending organizations said they were prepared to send fact-finding missions to iraq once it was safe to do so .
preliminary estimates on the cost of rebuilding iraq range from $ 20 billion a year for the first few years to as much as $ 600 billion over a decade .
snow said he would seek support among the group of seven leading industrial powers for forgiving a part of iraq 's foreign debt , estimated to be as high as $ 200 billion .

starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays . beginning in june , shops in germany will be able to remain open until 8 p.m. on saturdays , four hours longer than currently allowed .
the bundesrat , the upper chamber that of parliament represents germany ’ s federal states , on friday quickly approved legislation that had already cleared the lower chamber last month . “ i hope very much that the new opportunities will invigorate consumer spending and in turn the economy , ” said german economy minister wolfgang clement after the bundesrat vote . the center-left coalition of german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year agreed to liberalize shop hours in an attempt to bring germany in line with other modern economies and spur domestic demand . german regulations among most restrictive germany has long had some of the most restrictive shop hours in the industrialized world .
currently retail businesses are only allowed to open until 8 p.m. during the week and 4 p.m. on saturdays .
shopping on sunday and holidays , however , remains verboten .
the law regulating opening times was first set in 1956 and was last reformed in the 1990s . though the conservative opposition and their liberal allies approved the extension of hours in the bundesrat , they said the government ’ s reform doesn ’ t go nearly far enough .

but the extra time on saturday could mean fewer hectic weekends spent jockeying with pensioners who viciously elbow their way to the front of the vegetable display in hamburg and other german cities .
buying groceries at 3:30 p.m. on a saturday , when everyone is worried they 'll have to spend the next 40 hours without food , is considered by some shoppers as one of the most unpleasant experiences you can have in germany . less stress supporters of the law say making shopping a less stressful experience might also reinvigorate the ailing retail sector .
besides relieving the congestion in the stores themselves - thereby enticing more people to shop - some analysts think longer opening hours will create more jobs in a country where unemployment loiters chronically over 10 percent . “ in the current , extremely difficult situation retailers need the extra four hours on saturdays as quickly as possible , “ said johann hellwege , the head of the bag retail association . but trade unions remain incensed about the expansion of store hours , arguing it won ’ t boost sales or contribute a significantly amount of new jobs .

starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays . beginning in june , shops in germany will be able to remain open until 8 p.m. on saturdays , four hours longer than currently allowed .
the bundesrat , the upper chamber that of parliament represents germany ’ s federal states , on friday quickly approved legislation that had already cleared the lower chamber last month . “ i hope very much that the new opportunities will invigorate consumer spending and in turn the economy , ” said german economy minister wolfgang clement after the bundesrat vote . the center-left coalition of german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year agreed to liberalize shop hours in an attempt to bring germany in line with other modern economies and spur domestic demand . german regulations among most restrictive germany has long had some of the most restrictive shop hours in the industrialized world .

germany 's chancellor is meeting with the leaders of france and russia to discuss their stance on postwar iraq .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell says the u.n. security council 's role could be limited . german chancellor gerhard schröder has made up his mind .
either the united nations will be a guiding force in the reconstruction of iraq or germany will not participate .
the chancellor who waged a diplomatic campaign to stop the war from being launched laid out his position with the private television network rtl on thursday night .
" germany can and will join the reconstruction effort if it is conducted under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder said .
the chancellor made the comments a day before he travels to st. petersburg , russia , to discuss the question with two other allies in the anti-war effort - french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
the leaders are meeting three days after president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair pledged at their northern ireland war council that the united nations would have a " vital role " to play in the reconstruction effort .
russian pushes u.n. role as the st. petersburg summit approached , russian foreign minister igor ivanov spelled out his government 's position .
ivanov said the united nations should have a " central role " in postwar iraq .
" this authority must be used to achieve a political settlement in iraq within the shortest time possible , " ivanov said .
" this is in the interests of the iraqi people .
this is in the interests of the whole region . "
the debate over the role of the united nations is shaping up to be the next point of conflict between the u.s.-led coalition fighting in iraq and the european nations that futilely fought the american plan in the u.n. security council .
blair has also endorsed a u.n. role .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview published on friday by the german newspaper die welt that it would be wrong to assume that the war-fighting coalition would be willing to hand over total responsibility to the security council now that the iraqi regime has been overthrown .
like the world community , americans are divided on the issue as well .
a survey conducted by the pew research center found this week that 62 percent of respondents thought the united nations should play a significant role in post-war iraq .
it found that 31 percent did not .
the public is divided over the issue of who should have the most say in this process : 38 percent believe the united nations should take the lead in establishing a stable government in iraq , compared with 49 percent who either believe washington and its allies should have the most say or reject any un role .
u.s. seeks international support the united nations is one of many international organizations where officials are discussing the future of iraq .
u.s. treasury secretary john snow plans to use the weekend meetings of the 184-nation international monetary fund and the world bank to start pulling together the resources to rebuild iraq .
the lending organizations said they were prepared to send fact-finding missions to iraq once it was safe to do so .
preliminary estimates on the cost of rebuilding iraq range from $ 20 billion a year for the first few years to as much as $ 600 billion over a decade .
snow said he would seek support among the group of seven leading industrial powers for forgiving a part of iraq 's foreign debt , estimated to be as high as $ 200 billion .

germany 's chancellor is meeting with the leaders of france and russia to discuss their stance on postwar iraq .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell says the u.n. security council 's role could be limited . german chancellor gerhard schröder has made up his mind .
either the united nations will be a guiding force in the reconstruction of iraq or germany will not participate .
the chancellor who waged a diplomatic campaign to stop the war from being launched laid out his position with the private television network rtl on thursday night .
" germany can and will join the reconstruction effort if it is conducted under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder said .
the chancellor made the comments a day before he travels to st. petersburg , russia , to discuss the question with two other allies in the anti-war effort - french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
the leaders are meeting three days after president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair pledged at their northern ireland war council that the united nations would have a " vital role " to play in the reconstruction effort .
russian pushes u.n. role as the st. petersburg summit approached , russian foreign minister igor ivanov spelled out his government 's position .
ivanov said the united nations should have a " central role " in postwar iraq .
" this authority must be used to achieve a political settlement in iraq within the shortest time possible , " ivanov said .
" this is in the interests of the iraqi people .
this is in the interests of the whole region . "
the debate over the role of the united nations is shaping up to be the next point of conflict between the u.s.-led coalition fighting in iraq and the european nations that futilely fought the american plan in the u.n. security council .
blair has also endorsed a u.n. role .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview published on friday by the german newspaper die welt that it would be wrong to assume that the war-fighting coalition would be willing to hand over total responsibility to the security council now that the iraqi regime has been overthrown .
like the world community , americans are divided on the issue as well .
a survey conducted by the pew research center found this week that 62 percent of respondents thought the united nations should play a significant role in post-war iraq .
it found that 31 percent did not .
the public is divided over the issue of who should have the most say in this process : 38 percent believe the united nations should take the lead in establishing a stable government in iraq , compared with 49 percent who either believe washington and its allies should have the most say or reject any un role .
u.s. seeks international support the united nations is one of many international organizations where officials are discussing the future of iraq .
u.s. treasury secretary john snow plans to use the weekend meetings of the 184-nation international monetary fund and the world bank to start pulling together the resources to rebuild iraq .
the lending organizations said they were prepared to send fact-finding missions to iraq once it was safe to do so .
preliminary estimates on the cost of rebuilding iraq range from $ 20 billion a year for the first few years to as much as $ 600 billion over a decade .
snow said he would seek support among the group of seven leading industrial powers for forgiving a part of iraq 's foreign debt , estimated to be as high as $ 200 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic opposition member friedrich merz amid the debate in germany over the future of iraq , a leading member of the opposition christian democratic union linked germany 's participation to the reconstruction efforts to the awarding of contracts to german companies .

either the united nations will be a guiding force in the reconstruction of iraq or germany will not participate .
the chancellor who waged a diplomatic campaign to stop the war from being launched laid out his position with the private television network rtl on thursday night .
" germany can and will join the reconstruction effort if it is conducted under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder said .
the chancellor made the comments a day before he travels to st. petersburg , russia , to discuss the question with two other allies in the anti-war effort - french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
the leaders are meeting three days after president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair pledged at their northern ireland war council that the united nations would have a " vital role " to play in the reconstruction effort .
russian pushes u.n. role as the st. petersburg summit approached , russian foreign minister igor ivanov spelled out his government 's position .
ivanov said the united nations should have a " central role " in postwar iraq .
" this authority must be used to achieve a political settlement in iraq within the shortest time possible , " ivanov said .
" this is in the interests of the iraqi people .
this is in the interests of the whole region . "
the debate over the role of the united nations is shaping up to be the next point of conflict between the u.s.-led coalition fighting in iraq and the european nations that futilely fought the american plan in the u.n. security council .
blair has also endorsed a u.n. role .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview published on friday by the german newspaper die welt that it would be wrong to assume that the war-fighting coalition would be willing to hand over total responsibility to the security council now that the iraqi regime has been overthrown .
like the world community , americans are divided on the issue as well .
a survey conducted by the pew research center found this week that 62 percent of respondents thought the united nations should play a significant role in post-war iraq .
it found that 31 percent did not .
the public is divided over the issue of who should have the most say in this process : 38 percent believe the united nations should take the lead in establishing a stable government in iraq , compared with 49 percent who either believe washington and its allies should have the most say or reject any un role .
u.s. seeks international support the united nations is one of many international organizations where officials are discussing the future of iraq .
u.s. treasury secretary john snow plans to use the weekend meetings of the 184-nation international monetary fund and the world bank to start pulling together the resources to rebuild iraq .
the lending organizations said they were prepared to send fact-finding missions to iraq once it was safe to do so .
preliminary estimates on the cost of rebuilding iraq range from $ 20 billion a year for the first few years to as much as $ 600 billion over a decade .
snow said he would seek support among the group of seven leading industrial powers for forgiving a part of iraq 's foreign debt , estimated to be as high as $ 200 billion .

germany 's chancellor is meeting with the leaders of france and russia to discuss their stance on postwar iraq .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell says the u.n. security council 's role could be limited . german chancellor gerhard schröder has made up his mind .
either the united nations will be a guiding force in the reconstruction of iraq or germany will not participate .
the chancellor who waged a diplomatic campaign to stop the war from being launched laid out his position with the private television network rtl on thursday night .
" germany can and will join the reconstruction effort if it is conducted under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder said .
the chancellor made the comments a day before he travels to st. petersburg , russia , to discuss the question with two other allies in the anti-war effort - french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
the leaders are meeting three days after president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair pledged at their northern ireland war council that the united nations would have a " vital role " to play in the reconstruction effort .
russian pushes u.n. role as the st. petersburg summit approached , russian foreign minister igor ivanov spelled out his government 's position .
ivanov said the united nations should have a " central role " in postwar iraq .
" this authority must be used to achieve a political settlement in iraq within the shortest time possible , " ivanov said .
" this is in the interests of the iraqi people .
this is in the interests of the whole region . "
the debate over the role of the united nations is shaping up to be the next point of conflict between the u.s.-led coalition fighting in iraq and the european nations that futilely fought the american plan in the u.n. security council .
blair has also endorsed a u.n. role .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview published on friday by the german newspaper die welt that it would be wrong to assume that the war-fighting coalition would be willing to hand over total responsibility to the security council now that the iraqi regime has been overthrown .
like the world community , americans are divided on the issue as well .
a survey conducted by the pew research center found this week that 62 percent of respondents thought the united nations should play a significant role in post-war iraq .
it found that 31 percent did not .
the public is divided over the issue of who should have the most say in this process : 38 percent believe the united nations should take the lead in establishing a stable government in iraq , compared with 49 percent who either believe washington and its allies should have the most say or reject any un role .
u.s. seeks international support the united nations is one of many international organizations where officials are discussing the future of iraq .
u.s. treasury secretary john snow plans to use the weekend meetings of the 184-nation international monetary fund and the world bank to start pulling together the resources to rebuild iraq .
the lending organizations said they were prepared to send fact-finding missions to iraq once it was safe to do so .
preliminary estimates on the cost of rebuilding iraq range from $ 20 billion a year for the first few years to as much as $ 600 billion over a decade .
snow said he would seek support among the group of seven leading industrial powers for forgiving a part of iraq 's foreign debt , estimated to be as high as $ 200 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian democratic opposition member friedrich merz amid the debate in germany over the future of iraq , a leading member of the opposition christian democratic union linked germany 's participation to the reconstruction efforts to the awarding of contracts to german companies .
" if we provide financial support to the reconstruction , german companies have to profit from it , " friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- told the newspaper passauer neue presse .
" that goes without saying . "
in the television interview , schröder said he did not understand such a demand .
" i find it to be a little macabre . "

starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays . beginning in june , shops in germany will be able to remain open until 8 p.m. on saturdays , four hours longer than currently allowed .
the bundesrat , the upper chamber that of parliament represents germany ’ s federal states , on friday quickly approved legislation that had already cleared the lower chamber last month . “ i hope very much that the new opportunities will invigorate consumer spending and in turn the economy , ” said german economy minister wolfgang clement after the bundesrat vote . the center-left coalition of german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this year agreed to liberalize shop hours in an attempt to bring germany in line with other modern economies and spur domestic demand . german regulations among most restrictive germany has long had some of the most restrictive shop hours in the industrialized world .
currently retail businesses are only allowed to open until 8 p.m. during the week and 4 p.m. on saturdays .
shopping on sunday and holidays , however , remains verboten .
the law regulating opening times was first set in 1956 and was last reformed in the 1990s . though the conservative opposition and their liberal allies approved the extension of hours in the bundesrat , they said the government ’ s reform doesn ’ t go nearly far enough .
some politicians have called for the complete deregulation of open hours , including sundays . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust “ many had wished that a small step could become a giant leap , ” said ole von beust , hamburg ’ s conservative mayor .
but the extra time on saturday could mean fewer hectic weekends spent jockeying with pensioners who viciously elbow their way to the front of the vegetable display in hamburg and other german cities .
buying groceries at 3:30 p.m. on a saturday , when everyone is worried they 'll have to spend the next 40 hours without food , is considered by some shoppers as one of the most unpleasant experiences you can have in germany . less stress supporters of the law say making shopping a less stressful experience might also reinvigorate the ailing retail sector .
besides relieving the congestion in the stores themselves - thereby enticing more people to shop - some analysts think longer opening hours will create more jobs in a country where unemployment loiters chronically over 10 percent . “ in the current , extremely difficult situation retailers need the extra four hours on saturdays as quickly as possible , “ said johann hellwege , the head of the bag retail association . but trade unions remain incensed about the expansion of store hours , arguing it won ’ t boost sales or contribute a significantly amount of new jobs .

germany 's chancellor is meeting with the leaders of france and russia to discuss their stance on postwar iraq .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell says the u.n. security council 's role could be limited . german chancellor gerhard schröder has made up his mind .
either the united nations will be a guiding force in the reconstruction of iraq or germany will not participate .
the chancellor who waged a diplomatic campaign to stop the war from being launched laid out his position with the private television network rtl on thursday night .
" germany can and will join the reconstruction effort if it is conducted under the auspices of the united nations , " schröder said .
the chancellor made the comments a day before he travels to st. petersburg , russia , to discuss the question with two other allies in the anti-war effort - french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
the leaders are meeting three days after president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair pledged at their northern ireland war council that the united nations would have a " vital role " to play in the reconstruction effort .
russian pushes u.n. role as the st. petersburg summit approached , russian foreign minister igor ivanov spelled out his government 's position .
ivanov said the united nations should have a " central role " in postwar iraq .
" this authority must be used to achieve a political settlement in iraq within the shortest time possible , " ivanov said .
" this is in the interests of the iraqi people .
this is in the interests of the whole region . "
the debate over the role of the united nations is shaping up to be the next point of conflict between the u.s.-led coalition fighting in iraq and the european nations that futilely fought the american plan in the u.n. security council .
blair has also endorsed a u.n. role .
but u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in an interview published on friday by the german newspaper die welt that it would be wrong to assume that the war-fighting coalition would be willing to hand over total responsibility to the security council now that the iraqi regime has been overthrown .
like the world community , americans are divided on the issue as well .
a survey conducted by the pew research center found this week that 62 percent of respondents thought the united nations should play a significant role in post-war iraq .
it found that 31 percent did not .
the public is divided over the issue of who should have the most say in this process : 38 percent believe the united nations should take the lead in establishing a stable government in iraq , compared with 49 percent who either believe washington and its allies should have the most say or reject any un role .
u.s. seeks international support the united nations is one of many international organizations where officials are discussing the future of iraq .
u.s. treasury secretary john snow plans to use the weekend meetings of the 184-nation international monetary fund and the world bank to start pulling together the resources to rebuild iraq .
the lending organizations said they were prepared to send fact-finding missions to iraq once it was safe to do so .
preliminary estimates on the cost of rebuilding iraq range from $ 20 billion a year for the first few years to as much as $ 600 billion over a decade .
snow said he would seek support among the group of seven leading industrial powers for forgiving a part of iraq 's foreign debt , estimated to be as high as $ 200 billion .

digits matter a lot to visually impaired people .
the ones attached to our hands , as well as those which carry crystal clear radio to our ears .
some of us use them for reading .
many of us use them for exploring what 's around us .
even more of us , perhaps even enough of us to make the stereotype valid , use our digits for twiddling radio dials .
but when it comes to the other sort , or rather to the people who design and manufacture the equipment for receiving dab , -lrb- digital audio broadcasting -rrb- , they seem to have forgotten that the stereotype of the visually impaired radio fanatic even exists .
they have come very close to designing something which is unusable , or at least very difficult for us , perhaps the most avid , hungry and , let 's face it , needy group of radio listeners .
tuning lottery take , for a start , what used to be called in my day cruising the dial .
for some this might be the riches and adventure of short-wave offering the chance to pick up something you could barely hear , broadcasting in a language you did n't speak . "
it is impossible to read which stations you are passing through as you twist the tuning knob " for others , it was the easier pickings on fm and the relative clarity of your favourite local or national station .
whatever , the process was quite simple .
you gripped the dial gently but firmly between thumb and forefinger and slowly twisted it until you hit something which sooner or later you would identify or else know from memory what it was .
but now on many sets , including the videologic hi-fi tuners , the pure evoke model and the ministry of sound new personal dab receiver , finding and tuning stations has been turned into a complete lottery if you can not see the visual display on the unit .
even if you have some sight , as many visually impaired people do , the print is so small on the displays and the contrast so poor that it is impossible to read which stations you are passing through as you twist the tuning knob .
at her school , my six-year-old daughter does something called " brain gym " and i am thinking of asking if i can go along to a few of the sessions in order to help me with memorising the order in which the 20 or so digital stations appear on my various receivers .
name that tune then there is the second part of the digital double whammy .
when i worked as a radio d j , i accepted that it was a rather predictable and perhaps boring habit to say what a record was as you went into it , in a back announcement , or in some cases , at both ends of it .
i was also required to identify the station frequently enough to embed its name and location into listeners ' brains in the hope that they would come back to us .
but now there are some stations which have done away with jocks and ident jingles completely .
the only way you can find out which station and which song your listening to is to look at the visual display .
even on some of those stations which continue to offer gainful employment to presenters , it is noticeable that record titles are much less frequently announced or back announced , because the assumption is that anyone wanting to know can get that info from the screen .
that is an assumption which is not just wrong , it is nonsensical .
we are talking about a medium here where people are meant to talk to each other , where information is meant to be imparted and exchanged .
after all , the logical conclusion to all of this is an edition of the five live phone-in 606 passing off in total silence with people simply texting and e-mailing the gifted jonathan pierce whose vocal talents go completely to waste as he texts and e-mails back .
i am just a humble blind listener .
it is not up to me to come up with solutions .
this revolution is presumably being driven by some of the most brilliant technical minds in the radio business .
what i am saying to them is that maybe they should start thinking about solutions , or at least start remembering that , if radio belongs to everyone , it belongs at least as much to those of us who need and prefer to listen to rather than look at it .

digital radio offers new possibilities but also challenges digits matter a lot to visually impaired people .
the ones attached to our hands , as well as those which carry crystal clear radio to our ears .
some of us use them for reading .
many of us use them for exploring what 's around us .
even more of us , perhaps even enough of us to make the stereotype valid , use our digits for twiddling radio dials .
but when it comes to the other sort , or rather to the people who design and manufacture the equipment for receiving dab , -lrb- digital audio broadcasting -rrb- , they seem to have forgotten that the stereotype of the visually impaired radio fanatic even exists .
they have come very close to designing something which is unusable , or at least very difficult for us , perhaps the most avid , hungry and , let 's face it , needy group of radio listeners .
tuning lottery take , for a start , what used to be called in my day cruising the dial .
for some this might be the riches and adventure of short-wave offering the chance to pick up something you could barely hear , broadcasting in a language you did n't speak .
it is impossible to read which stations you are passing through as you twist the tuning knob bbci ouch ! : life as a disabled person for others , it was the easier pickings on fm and the relative clarity of your favourite local or national station .
whatever , the process was quite simple .
you gripped the dial gently but firmly between thumb and forefinger and slowly twisted it until you hit something which sooner or later you would identify or else know from memory what it was .
but now on many sets , including the videologic hi-fi tuners , the pure evoke model and the ministry of sound new personal dab receiver , finding and tuning stations has been turned into a complete lottery if you can not see the visual display on the unit .
even if you have some sight , as many visually impaired people do , the print is so small on the displays and the contrast so poor that it is impossible to read which stations you are passing through as you twist the tuning knob .
at her school , my six-year-old daughter does something called " brain gym " and i am thinking of asking if i can go along to a few of the sessions in order to help me with memorising the order in which the 20 or so digital stations appear on my various receivers .
name that tune then there is the second part of the digital double whammy .
when i worked as a radio d j , i accepted that it was a rather predictable and perhaps boring habit to say what a record was as you went into it , in a back announcement , or in some cases , at both ends of it .
i was also required to identify the station frequently enough to embed its name and location into listeners ' brains in the hope that they would come back to us .
but now there are some stations which have done away with jocks and ident jingles completely .
the only way you can find out which station and which song your listening to is to look at the visual display .
even on some of those stations which continue to offer gainful employment to presenters , it is noticeable that record titles are much less frequently announced or back announced , because the assumption is that anyone wanting to know can get that info from the screen .
that is an assumption which is not just wrong , it is nonsensical .
we are talking about a medium here where people are meant to talk to each other , where information is meant to be imparted and exchanged .
after all , the logical conclusion to all of this is an edition of the five live phone-in 606 passing off in total silence with people simply texting and e-mailing the gifted jonathan pierce whose vocal talents go completely to waste as he texts and e-mails back .
i am just a humble blind listener .
it is not up to me to come up with solutions .
this revolution is presumably being driven by some of the most brilliant technical minds in the radio business .
what i am saying to them is that maybe they should start thinking about solutions , or at least start remembering that , if radio belongs to everyone , it belongs at least as much to those of us who need and prefer to listen to rather than look at it .

" i produce honey and beeswax , there are a multiple of products you can use from keeping bees and then we sell it on . "
bees have been around for millions of years - they were fully developed in their present form long before modern mammals had evolved .
honeybees are the most important producers of honey .
they gather nectar from flowers and plants and carry it to the hive or nest .
other worker bees then take over , preparing it for storing by adding enzymes .
once the bees have collected the pollen and nectar , they process and store honey in honey combs in the beehive .
enrol there are more than 35,000 bee keepers throughout the uk .
a spokesman for llysfasi college said a few years ago staff had struggled to find people wanting to enrol on the course .
this year 's intake is 13 and others have been turned away because of a lack of spaces .
the course will run for three weekends and teach fledgling beekeepers what equipment they will need to start off .
pupils will go to an apiary on saturday to see and handle the bees .

the last of 49 stations to come back into operation on saturday were on the extreme western stretch of the line .
services have now resumed between north acton and west ruislip , the essex ' hainault loop ' and the woodford to epping sections .
london underground -lrb- lu -rrb- said the news would come as a relief to commuters , retailers and shoppers .
limited timetable but it warned passengers would have to wait for a full service , as a limited timetable is still running .
lu expects to restore a full working timetable of central line services around the end of april .
the central line was suspended when a train derailed at chancery lane station in central london on 25 january , injuring 32 people .
the incident was caused by a traction motor attached to the underside of the train coming loose and falling on to the track , derailing carriages .
' long , hard slog ' lu was forced to close the line while it modified its fleet of 85 trains , causing widespread disruption to tube users .
managing director for lu paul godier said : " we said we would be back to all destinations by easter and i 'm pleased we have some good news at last and are able to beat that estimate by a week .
" this has been a long , hard slog and it 's still not over yet .
" but we have now reached a very significant milestone and i just want to thank all those customers who have stoically tolerated this disruption for so long . "
long-standing engineering works planned between north acton and west ruislip will mean a limited closure in this area over the easter weekend , lu said .
the central line disruption has cost london underground £ 40m , while the cost to the london economy is thought to be about £ 275m .
